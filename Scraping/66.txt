Very Short Answer Type Questions
Q. 1. What is the value of water potential of pure water?

(KVS Agra 2017)

Ans. Zero
Q. 2. Which two factors affect water potential?

(DDE 2017)

Ans. Concentration of solute and external pressure.
Q. 3. What will happen to water potential when solutes are added?
Ans. When solutes are added it lowers water potential of a system i.e., it exhibits negative
value.
Q. 4. Why all solutions have a lower water potential than pure water?
Ans. If some solute is dissolved in pure water, the solution has fewer free water and the
concentration of pure water decreases, reducing its water potential, hence all solutions have
lower water potential than pure water.
Q. 5. Why is inhibition considered as diffusion?
Ans. Imbibition is considered as diffusion, since water movement is along a concentration
gradient.
Q. 6. What do you understand by the term facilitated diffusion?
Ans. The concentration gradient through fixed members transport protein without involving
energy expenditure is called facilitated diffusion.
Q. 7. Define solute potential.
Ans. The magnitude by which water potential is lowered due to dissociation of a solute is
called solute potential.
Q. 8. What do you understand by bleeding?
Ans. The exudation of watery sap from the injured parts of a plant is called bleeding.
Q. 9. Why endodermis is impervious to water?
Ans. The inner boundary of the cortex i.e., endodermis, is impervious to water because of a
band of suberized matrix called the casparian strip.
Q.10. What is turgor pressure?
Ans. The pressure built up against the cell wall by the cytoplasm due to diffusion of water into
the cell is known as turgor pressure.
Q.11. Write two factors on which the rate and direction of osmosis depends.
Ans. The two factors on which the rate and direction of osmosis depends:
(i) Pressure gradient.

(ii) Concentration gradient.
Q.12. What would be the ùöøp of a flaccid cell?
Ans. Negative.
Q.13. What is water potential?
Ans. Water potential is the potential energy of water which helps in the movement of water
and is determined by solute potential and pressure potential.
Q.14. Mass flow hypothesis is related to which process in plants?

[KVS 2015]

Ans. Mass flow hypothesis is related to translocation of sugars from source to sink.
Q. 15. Name the pathways by which water flows from roots hair to the deeper layers of
root.
[KVS Silchar 2017]
Ans. Apoplast pathway and symplast pathway.
Q. 16. Define translocation.
Ans. Translocation refers to "the transport over longer distances proceeding through
vascular system -xylem and phloem."
Q. 17. What is trans-membrane pathway?
Ans. Trans-membrane pathway is the movement through the cell membrane.
Q. 18. Which fraction of soil water is available to plants for absorption by roots?
Ans. Capillary water.
Q. 19. What is a mycorrhiza?
Ans. A mycorrhiza is a symbiotic association of a fungus with the root system of higher
Plants.
Q. 20. Name the four elements that are easily, mobilised in plants.
Ans. N2, Mg, P, S, and K
Q. 21. What is absorption lag?
Ans. Absorption lag is the short fall of rate of water absorption over the rate of transpiration.
It is due to high rate of transpiration.
Q. 22. When does wilting occurs?
Ans. Wilting occurs when the loss of water by evaporation exceeds the rate of uptake by
roots.
Q. 23. Name the theory proposed by Dixon for ascent of sap.
Ans. Transpiration pull theory.

Q. 24. Which metal element is involved in the opening and closing of stomata?
Ans. K+ ion is involved in the opening and closing of stomata.
Q. 25. Define the term ‚Äòsource‚Äô and 'sink‚Äô in phloem transport.
Ans. The region which synthesize carbohydrates are called 'source' while the regions, where
carbohydrates are utilized or stored are known as sink.
Q. 26. How does ascent of sap occur?
Ans. Ascent of sap occurs through the tracheary elements of xylem.
Q. 27. Why rate of transpiration increases with an increase in root-shoot ratio?
Ans. The rate of transpiration increases with an increase in root-shoot ratio because of
greater availability of water due to more extensive root system.
Q. 28. What does the fungal partner provide to the plant in the symbiotic association
mycorrhiza?
Ans. The fungus provides minerals and water to the roots.
Q. 29. What are the channels of transport of food in plants?
Ans. The channels of transport are sieve tubes and companion cells of phloem.
