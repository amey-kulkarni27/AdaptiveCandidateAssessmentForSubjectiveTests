CBSE always believes in Global Trends of Educational Transformation. The CBSE curriculum gets its
lead from National Curriculum Framework

-

2005 and Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act

-

2009. CBSE introduced CCE in the later half of 2009. CCE has been started to improve the quality of
Education and was meant to lessen the burden of studies on students. CCE stands for Continuous &
Comprehensive Evaluation. The term 'Continuous' in CCE refers to periodicity and regularity in
assessment and the term 'Comprehensive' refers to overall assessment of the learner, in both curricular &
co curricular scheme of things.
These Oswaal CCE Question Banks for Classes IX & X have been written so as to supplement the
need of the students to prepare for these progressive assessments at school during the entire year.
CCE Question Bank has been divided into two parts: Formative assessment (FA) & Summative
Assessment (SA). Formative part of the book will assist the students to prepare for the frequent class room
based evaluation, both as an individual and as a group activity. The various formative techniques include
Quizzes, Chapter assignment, Work sheets, Projects, Seminar, Symposium, Action Plans, etc. These
activities have been elaborated by CBSE Board on

www.cbse.nic.in.

The students can read through all

these components while revising a chapter to be always prepared forthe surprise FA's in the class.
Furthermore, each chapter includes brief description and covers all typologies of Questions specified
by CBSE, with well-labelled and high quality figures I diagrams for easy and fast learning. Solutions are
checked twice and made precise as per the CBSE marking scheme. Practically, this book provides students
everything they need to learn. Since we believe in continuous improvement, hence this book is updated,
reviewed every year with new questions, changes in syllabus and reader's suggestions.
At last we would like to thank our authors, editors, reviewers and specially students who regularly send
us suggestions which helps in continuous improvement of this book and makes this book stand in the
category of uone of the Bestu. Wish you all Happy Learning.

Its Nature and Behaviour

The subject of Science plays an important role in developing well-defined abilities in cognitive, affective and
psychomotor domains in children. It augments the spirit of enquiry, creativity, objectivity and aesthetic
sensibility.
Whereas the upper primary stage demands that a number of opportunities should be provided to the
students to engage them with the processes of Science like observing, recording observations, drawing,
tabulation, plotting graphs, etc., the secondary stage expects abstraction and quantitative reasoning to
occupy a more central place in the teaching and learning of Science. Thus, the idea of atoms and molecules
being the building blocks of matter makes its appearance, as does Newton's law of gravitation.
The present syllabus has been designed around six broad themes viz. Food, Materials, The World ofThe Living,
How Things Work, Moving Things, People and Ideas, Natural Phenomenon and Natural Resources. Special
care has been taken to avoid temptation of adding too many concepts than can be comfortably learnt in the
given time frame. No attempt has been made to be comprehensive.
At this stage, while science is still a common subject, the disciplines of Physics, Chemistry and Biology begin to
emerge. The students should be exposed to experiences as well as modes of reasoning that are typical of the
subject.

General Instructions:
1.

The units specified for each term shall be assessed through both Formative and Summative Assessments.

2.

In each term, there will be two Formative Assessments each carrying 10% weightage.

3.

The Summative Assessment in each term will carry 30% weightage.

4.

Hands on Practical examination will be conducted through Formative Assessment in every term with 20%
weightage of total term marks.

5.

Assessment of Practical Skills through Practical Based Questions (PBQ) will carry 15 marks in every term
end SummativeAssessment.

[CBSE Marking Scheme, 2015] 3
		 Detailed Answer :
		
The temperature remains constant as the heat gets used up in changing the state by overcoming the forces of
attraction between the particles.
		
For example, a solid melts on heating its temperature does not rise until the entire solid is converted into liquid.
This heat energy gets hidden into the contents and is known as the latent heat.

Matter around us exists in three states-solid, liquid and gas.


Solids have definite shape, distinct boundaries and fixed
volume.


Liquids have fixed volume but no fixed shape.


Gases neither have fixed shape nor volume.


Solids possess least compressibility.


Liquids possess higher compressibility than solids.


Gases possess highest compressibility as compared to solids and liquids. Thus, used as a fuel (E.g. LPG,
CNG).


The forces of attraction between the particles are maximum in solids, intermediate in liquids and minimum
in gases.


The spaces in between constituent particles and K.E. of the particles are minimum in case of solids,
intermediate in liquids and maximum in gases.

KNOW THE TERMS

Matter : Any thing that has mass and occupies space is called matter.
Solid : Solid is defined as that form of matter which possess rigidity, is incompressible and hence has a
definite shape and a definite volume.

Q. 1. What is the effect of change of pressure on physical
state of matter ? Explain with an example of a gas.
		
(Board 2015, Set-K34UQKW)
Ans. The physical state of matter can be changed by
changing the pressure. By lowering temperature
and increasing the pressure gases can be changed
into liquids and some solids can be changed into
gases on decreasing the pressure.
This happens with gases as there is lots of space
between the particles of a gas and upon applying
high pressure particles come close to each other
which upon cooling gets liquified.

QUICK REVIEW

SI unit of temperature is Kelvin. T (K) = T (°C) + 273.
The melting point of a solid is an indication of the strength of the force of attraction between its particles.
The temperature at which a liquid starts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is known as boiling point.
Latent heat of vaporization is the heat energy required to change 1 kg of liquid to gas at atmospheric pressure at
its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk phenomenon.
In evaporation, the conversion of liquid to gaseous state occurs at a much slower rate, compared to boiling.
Evaporation takes place only at the surface of the liquid while boiling can take place in all parts of the liquid.
Evaporation is surface phenomenon.
Evaporation is a continuous or ongoing process. Evaporation causes cooling.
The rate of evaporation is affected by the surface area exposed to atmosphere, temperature, humidity and wind
speed.
Since evaporation is a surface phenomenon, therefore, it increases with an increase in surface area.
Evaporation increases with an increase in temperature.
Evaporation decreases with an increase in humidity.
Evaporation increases with the increase in wind speed.

KNOW THE TERMS






Humidity : The amount of water vapour present in the air.
Density : It is the mass occupied by a solid per unit volume and is obtained by dividing the mass of a particular
solid by the volume occupied by that mass of the solid.
Fusion : The process in which a solid changes to liquid state by absorbing heat at constant temperature.
Diffusion : The process in which particles of one substance occupy the vacant spaces present in the particles of
the other substance, is called diffusion.
Condensation : The process in which a gas changes into liquid state by giving out heat at constant temperature.
Latent heat : The hidden heat which breaks the force of attraction between the molecules during change of state.

Latent heat of fusion : The amount of heat energy that is needed to convert one kg of a solid into the liquid state
at atmospheric pressure at its melting point is termed as latent heat of fusion.
Boiling point : The temperature at which a liquid starts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is known as boiling
point.
Freezing point : The temperature at which a liquid changed to solid by giving out heat at the atmospheric
pressure.
Latent heat of vaporisation : The amount of heat energy that is needed to convert one kg of a liquid at its boiling
point temperature into its vapour state without any rise in temperature, is termed as latent heat of vaporisation.
Melting point : The melting point of a solid may be defined as the temperature at which a solid melts to become
a liquid at the atmospheric pressure.
Sublimation : Sublimation is the change of a solid directly into the gaseous state without passing through the
liquid state upon heating and back to the solid state when the temperature is lowered.
Evaporation : The phenomenon of change of liquid to the vapour state at any temperature below the boiling
point of the liquid is termed as evaporation.
Transpiration : The process of evaporation of water from the aerial parts of plants especially leaves is called

(a) In summer wearing of cotton clothes is more
comfortable.
(b) Water kept in an earthen pot becomes cool in
summer.
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-042)
Ans. (a) Cotton clothes are good absorber of sweat.
During evaporation of sweat, heat is lost by
the body which makes us feel cool.
(b) On a hot day, evaporation of water from the

Define latent heat of fusion.
		
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-050)

1
(CBSE Marking Scheme, 2012)

2 Marks each
Ans. Heat energy is needed to melt a solid because there
exist forces of attraction between the molecules
and heat energy is essential to overcome the forces
of attraction.
Latent heat of fusion is the amount of heat energy
required to change 1 kg of solid into liquid at
atmospheric pressure at its melting point.

Q. 6. Which of the following two will give you more
severe burns and why ?
(a) Steam at 373 K
		

(b) Water at 373 K.
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-051)

Ans. Steam at 373 K will give more severe burns. Steam
has more heat content because of latent heat of
vaporization. When it touches our body it gives this
extra amount of heat causing more severe burns. 2
Q. 7. Identify and explain the factor responsible for
changed rate of evaporation in the following
situations :
(a) While putting clothes for drying, we spread
them out.
(b) Water coolers are not effective on a rainy day.
		

(Board Term I, 2012 Set-052)

Ans. (a) Spreading the clothes for drying increases the
surface area which helps it to dry faster as the
rate of evaporation increases with increase in
surface area.

Q. 11. Osmosis is a special kind of diffusion. Comment.
(HOTS)
Ans. Diffusion is the process in which molecules of a
substance move from the place of (their) higher
concentration to the place of lower concentration.
But during osmosis, the water molecules (or solvent)
move from concentrated solution to dilute solution
through a semipermeable membrane Thus, osmosis

Q. 1. People of village use earthen pots to get cool
water in water. Explain the reason that why water
remains cool in earthen pots ?

Detailed Answer :
The temperature remains constant as the heat gets
used up in changing the state by overcoming the
forces of attraction between the particles.

(Board 2015, Set-LOV7LN7)
Ans. There are pores in an earthen pot through
which the liquid inside the pot evaporates. This
evaporation makes the water inside the pot cool.
In this way, water kept in an earthen pot becomes
cool during summers.

Rahul is fond of mountaineering. In his summer
holidays, he planned to climb a high mountain
with his friends. During climbing one of his
friends got hurt and required hot water for the
treatment. He quickly took out his burner to boil
the water. He found that on the mountain water
took much less time to boil than on the ground.
(a) Why does water boil at a lower temperature at
higher altitudes ?
(b) What values are displayed by Rahul ?
(c) Give one more example related to this
phenomenon.
(a) Boiling occurs at a point where vapour pressure
is equal to the external atmospheric pressure.
At higher altitudes atmospheric pressure is
much less. Less thermal energy is required to
get vapour pressure equal to the atmospheric
pressure.
(b) This shows that Rahul is sympathetic and
friendly.
(c) Cooking of potatoes take much longer at the
top of a mountain because boiling temperature
of water is lower.

Q. 1. Why are pieces of pumice stone placed in the
container before heating water while determining
the boiling point of water in the laboratory ?
Explain briefly.(Board Term I, 2015 Set-LOV7LN7)
Ans. Pieces of pumice stones are placed in the container
before heating to avoid bumping of liquid when the

Elements, Compounds, Mixtures, Heterogeneous
and Homogeneous mixtures
QUICK REVIEW

Matter can be classified as pure substances or mixtures.


A pure substance may either contain constituent particles of
only one kind or of different kinds. A pure substance has a
fixed composition.


An element is a basic form of matter which cannot be broken
down into simpler substances by any physical or chemical
means.

TOPIC - 2
Separation Techniques, Physical and
Chemical Change .... P. 30


Elements can be broadly classified as metals, non-metals
and metalloids.


Metals are one category of elements that have lustre. They
conduct heat and electricity. They are sonorous. They are
malleable and ductile.



Non-metals do not have lustre, are not sonorous and are bad conductors of heat and electricity.
Metalloids are elements having properties intermediate between those of metals and non-metals.
A compound is a pure substance composed of two or more elements chemically combined in a fixed
proportion. It can be broken down into simpler substances by chemical or electrochemical methods.
Properties of compounds are different from those of its constituent elements, whereas a mixture shows
the properties of its constituent elements or compounds.
A mixture contains two or more elements or compounds which are mixed together in any proportion. In
a mixture no new compound is formed. A mixture shows the properties of the constituent substances.
Mixtures are classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous mixtures.
Mixtures whose components mix completely with each other to make a uniform composition are called
homogeneous mixtures.
A heterogeneous mixture has a non-uniform composition.
Alloys are mixture of two or more metals or a metal and a non-metal and cannot be separated by physical
methods.
The ability of a substance to dissolve in another substance is called solubility.
Homogeneous mixture of two or more substances is called a solution.
Component of a solution present in small quantity is called a solute.
Component of a solution present in large quantity is called a solvent.


Particles of a solution are smaller than 1 nm in diameter. They cannot be seen by naked eyes.


Particles of solution do not scatter beam of light.

Solute particles cannot be separated from the mixture by filtration.
Solution with high solute concentration is called concentrated solution and those with low concentration is called
dilute solution.
l The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute present in a given amount (mass or volume) of solvent or
Amount of solute
solution. Concentration of a solution =
Amount of solution


Percentage by mass is one of the methods of expressing concentration of solution.


There are two kinds of heterogeneous mixtures, colloids and suspensions.


Colloids are mixtures with particle sizes from 1 nm to 100 nm.


The component of colloid present in small amount is called dispersed phase.


The medium in which colloidal particles disperse or suspend themselves is called dispersion medium.


In a colloidal system particles are always suspended and do not settle down. This constant colliding of the particles
in continuous motion is called Brownian movement.


Scattering of a beam of light when light is passed through a colloidal solution is called the Tyndall effect.


Colloids are classified according to the state (solid, liquid or gas) of the dispersed medium or dispersing medium
and the dispersed phase.


Colloid in which dispersed medium is a liquid and dispersed phase is solid is called as solution.


Colloid in which both dispersed phase and dispersed medium are in liquid state is called as an emulsion.


Colloid in which dispersed phase is either liquid or a solid and dispersed medium is a gas is called as aerosol.


A suspension is heterogeneous mixture in which the solute particles do not dissolve but remain suspended
throughout bulk of medium. Particles of suspension are visible to naked eye. Suspensions are heterogeneous
mixtures with particles that have a size greater than 1000 nanometers.

KNOW THE TERMS

A pure substance consists of particles of only one kind matter which are similar to one another and which cannot
be separated into other kinds of matter by any physical process.


An element is defined as a basic form of matter which cannot be broken down into simpler substances by any
chemical method. For example, hydrogen, oxygen, mercury, gold, iron, copper, etc.


Metals : Possess lustre. They are malleable and ductile, good conductors of heat and eletricity and are sonorous.
For example, iron, copper, aluminium, silver, etc.


Non-metals : Are neigher malleable nor ductile. They are not lustrous and non-conductors of heat and electricity.
For example, hydrogen, oxygen, bromine, sulphur, phosphorus, etc.

l		
Metalloids or semi-metals : Have intermediate properties between those of metals and non-metals. For example,

silicon, germanium, arsenic and antimony.
l		
A

compund is defined as a pure substance made up of two or more elements chemically combined in a fixed
proportion by mass. For example, water, carbon dioxide, limestone, etc.


Mixtures : A mixture contains two or more substances (elements or compounds) which are physically mixed in
any proportion but not chemically combined.


A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. The major component of the solution is called
the solvent and the minor component is called the solute.

l		
Alloys are homogeneous mixtures. They may also be regarded as solid in solid solution.

Concentration of a solution is the amount of solute present per unit volume or per unit mass of the solution/
solvent.

Saturated solution is a solution which contains the maximum amount of the solute dissolved in a given quantity
of the solvent at the given temperature and which cannot dissolve any more solute at that temperature is called
a saturated solution.
l		
Unsaturated solution is a solution which can dissolve more amount of solute in it at the given temperature is
called the unsaturated solution.

Oswaal CBSE (CCE) Question Bank (Term-1), SCIENCE, Class – 9

l		
Supersaturated solution is a solution which temporarily contains more solute than the saturation level is called a

supersaturated solution.
suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solute particles do not dissolve but remain suspended
throughout the bulk of the medium.
l		
Colloids are heterogenous mixtures in which the size of the particles lies in between those of true solutions and
suspensions.

Q. 9. Explain why particles of colloidal solution do not
settle down when left undisturbed, while in the
case of a suspension they do settle ?
(HOTS)
Ans. Colloidal particles are smaller in size. They remain in
state of zig-zag motion (Brownian motion) always,
so the force of gravity is encountered and they do
not settle down. But the particles in suspension
are larger in size, so they settle down under the
influence of gravity.

QUICK REVIEW





Plasma membrane is a thin, selectively permeable membrane, covering the cell and is made up of lipids and
proteins.
Functions of plasma membrane :
(i) It separates the contents of a cell from its outside environment.
(ii) It regulates the flow of substances to and from the cell through diffusion, facilitated diffusion, active transport
and endocytosis.
Osmosis is diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane.
A cell placed in different solutions :
(i) Hypotonic solution : A cell placed in it will gain water.
(ii) Hypertonic solution : A cell placed in it will lose water, also known as plasmolysis.
(iii) Isotonic solution : A cell placed in it will neither gain nor lose water.
Cells of plants, fungi & bacteria : Contain both plasma membrane & cell wall. Cell wall is rigid, non-living &
outer most covering, composed mainly of cellulose.
When placed in hypertonic solution, a living plant cell shows plasmolysis.
Cell wall provides mechanical strength to the cell. It permits the cell to withstand huge changes in the surrounding
medium.
Nucleus is an important, spherical, usually centrally located constituent of the cell and is bounded by double
layered nuclear envelope.
The nucleus of a dividing cell shows rod-shaped chromosomes, made up of DNA and proteins. In a non-dividing
cell, the chromosomes elongate and take the form of thread-like chromatin.
DNA molecules are responsible for transmitting hereditary information from one generation to the next.
Nucleus controls all metabolic activities of the cell.
Depending on the presence or absence of nucleus, cells may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic.
(i) Prokaryotic cells lack a well-defined nucleus and instead show nucleoid, an undefined nuclear region
containing the genetic material.
(ii) Eukaryotic cells possess a proper nucleus with nuclear membrane.
Cytoplasm is the fluid content of the cell, occurring between nucleus and plasma membrane. It stores several vital
chemicals and is the site of certain important metabolic pathways.
Several specialized cell organelles are present in the cytoplasm. These organelles perform different kinds of
metabolic activities and are kept separate from each other.
The various cell organelles include endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, lysosomes, mitochondria, plastids,
vacuoles and centrosome.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an extensive, interconnected, membrane bound network of tubes and sheets.
Ribosomes are attached to the surface of Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER) and are absent in Smooth
Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER).
Functions of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) :
(i) It synthesizes important proteins (RER) and lipids (SER).
(ii) It provides a pathway for intracellular transport of materials.
(iii) SER of liver cells is important for detoxification.
Golgi apparatus is a network of stacked, flattened, membrane bound sacs and vesicles.

Oswaal CBSE (CCE) Question Bank (Term-1), SCIENCE, Class – 9

Golgi apparatus carries out the storage, modification and packaging of substances manufactured in the cell and
is also involved in lysosome formation.
The spherical, sac-like lysosomes contain powerful digestive enzymes and form the waste disposal system of the
cell. They are also known as ‘suicide bags’.
Mitochondria and plastids are covered by two membranes and possess their own DNA and ribosomes.
Mitochondria are the ‘power houses of the cell’, providing energy for various metabolic activities.
Chromoplasts and leucoplasts are the two types of plastids present in plant cells.
Chloroplasts are chromoplasts containing chlorophyll and carry out photosynthesis in plants.
Leucoplasts store starch, oil and protein granules.
The large central vacuole of mature plant cells provides turgidity to the cell and also stores important substances.
In unicellular organisms, vacuoles play important roles in nutrition and osmo-regulation.
Ribosomes are sites of protein synthesis.
Centrosome is found only in animal cells and consists of 2 centrioles. Centrosome helps in cell division.
The membrane-bound cell organelles are absent in prokaryotic cells.
The basic structural organization of the cell helps it to perform important functions like respiration, nutrition,
excretion and protein synthesis.

Q. 21. Why is endocytosis found in animals only ?
		
(HOTS)
Ans. Endocytosis is engulfment of food and other
substances from external medium by plasma
membrane. This is possible only when plasma
membrane is in direct contact with external
medium. It occurs only in animal cells. In plant cells,
a cell wall is present over the plasma membrane.
Therefore, their plasma membranes cannot perform
endocytosis.

Ans. (a) Because of its affinity for DNA and RNA,
methylene blue will produce a darker stain
leading the DNA in the nucleus to stand out so
that nucleus can be clearly seen.
(b) On boiling, all the cells of rheo leaves become
dead. On adding sugar syrup nothing will
happen as liquid cannot pass through dead cell
membrane.
(c) On placing RBCs in concentrated solution, the
water will come out and the cell will shrink as
the concentration of solution outside is higher

CELL — A BASIC UNIT OF LIFE

[ 57

Ans. Each cell has got certain specific components within
it known as cell organelles. Each cell organelle
performs a special function. A cell is able to live and
perform all its functions perfectly because of these
organelles. This is called division of labour. All cells
are found to have the same organelles, no matter
what their function is or in which organism they
are found.

taken out of the two beakers.
(ii) On the basis of above observation, categorise
the two solutions as hypotonic and hypertonic.
		
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-062)

Ans. Rough endoplasmic reticulum looks rough under a
microscope because it has particles called ribosomes
attached to its surface and smooth endoplasmic
reticulum do not have ribosomes attached to it.
It helps in the manufacture of fat molecules
or lipids important for cell function. Some of
these proteins and lipids help in the building of
cell membrane, the process called membrane
biogenesis. (CBSE Marking Scheme, 2012) 2 + 1
Q. 11. Describe the role played by the Lysosomes in a
cell. Why these are termed as suicidal bags ? How
do they perform their function ?
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-034)

Ans. (i) In beaker A, the raisins would swell because
water concentration is higher outside the
cell membrane. So more water enters the
membrane than leaves it.
In beaker B, raisins will shrink because water
concentration is less outside the cell membrane.
So more water comes out of the membrane than
enters.
(ii) A – hypotonic. B – hypertonic.

the de-shelled egg in a concentrated salt
solution for five minutes. What changes did he
observe in the egg ? Give reason for the same.
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-072)

Ans. Lysosomes are a kind of waste disposal system of
cell. They help to keep the cell clean by digesting any
foreign material as well as worn out cell organelles.
Foreign material entering the cell such as bacteria
or food ends up in lysosomes.
During the disturbance in cellular metabolism
lysosomes may burst and the enzymes digest their
own cell. Therefore, lysosomes are also known
as suicidal bags. Lysosomes are able to do this
because they contain powerful enzymes capable
of breaking down all organic material. 1 + 1 + 1

reasons ?

5 Marks each
(iii) How do substances like CO2 and water move
in and out of the cell ? (Board Term I, 2010, 11)
Ans. (i)  	(a) Endocytosis : The flexibility of the cell
membrane enables the cell to engulf food and
other materials from its external environment.
Such process is known as endocytosis.
		
(b) Plasmolysis : When a living plant cell loses
water through osmosis, there is shrinkage
or contraction of the contents of the cell
away from the cell wall. This phenomenon
is known as plasmolysis.
(ii) When the organisation of a cell gets damaged,
lysosomes will burst and their enzymes will eat
up their own cell organelles. Therefore, lysosomes
are also known as the suicidal bags of the cell.
(iii) Gases like CO2 and O2 move in and out of the
cell by diffusion from their higher concentration
to lower concentration. Water enters the cell by
endosmosis through semi-permeable plasma
membrane from its higher concentration to
lower concentration.
Similarly, water moves out of the cell by

Q. 4. (a) What would happen if the plasma membrane
ruptures or breaks down ?
(b) What would happen to the life of a cell if there
were no Golgi apparatus ?
(NCERT based)
Ans. (a) Plasma membrane is the selectively permeable
membrane that surrounds the cell and allows
the entry and exit of selected materials into
and out of the cell. If it ruptures, the contents
of the cell will come in direct contact with the
surrounding medium and not only unwanted
material will be able to enter freely into the cell,
but useful material will also find its way out of
the cell easily. This will seriously disrupt the
various metabolic activities of the cell and will
result in its eminent death.
(b) If there were no Golgi apparatus, the material
synthesized by Endoplasmic reticulum
would not be carried to the various parts
inside and outside the cell. Also as the Golgi
apparatus performs the function of storage
and modification of the material synthesized in
the cell, these material could not be stored and
modified further.
Moreover, there will be no production of
lysosomes which will cause the accumulation
of waste material, viz. worn out and dead cell
organelles within the cell which will ultimately
lead to cell death.

(b) Put one teaspoon sugar in cup B.

Cup A

Cup B
Fresh peeled
potato cup

Sugar
solution

Boiled
Potato

Cup C
Cup D
Ans. (i) Water gathers in the hollowed portion of B
and C because of the process of endosmosis
(moving in of the solvent). A potato is made
up of several cells, and the cell membranes
are selectively permeable. As the cups B and C
are filled with sugar and salt respectively and
their outer part is in contact with the water,
the concentration of water outside the cups is
higher than inside the cups, so water moves
from its higher concentration towards the lower
concentration, i.e., inside the cup.
(ii) Potato A acts as a control of the experiment. It
is very necessary for comparing the results of
the experiment and shows that if the conc. of
water is same on both sides, there will be no
movement of water.
(iii) Water does not gather in the hollowed out
portions of A as it does not contain hypertonic
solution so there is no concentration difference.
Water does not gather in the cup D as the cells
of boiled potato are dead and hence no osmosis
occurs.

(iii) What values were shown by Ravi ?

60 ]

Oswaal CBSE (CCE) Question Bank (Term-1), SCIENCE, Class – 9

Ans. (i) Osmosis is the movement of water from the
region of its higher concentration (pure water
or dilute solution) to the region of its lower
concentration, when the two are separated
by a semipermeable membrane. When
external water enters the cell it is known as
Endosmosis.
(ii) Cell membrane is semi permeable membrane
for water, ions, sugar, amino acids etc. These
substances pass through the plasma membrane
by an active process so it is called selectively
permeable.

fingers was shrunk. She was amazed to see her
hands and was worried.
(i) Why does the skin of Sheela’s fingers shrink
when she washes clothes for a long time ?
(ii) What makes Sheela worried ?
Ans. (i) Clothes are washed with soap or detergent
solution. This solution is hypertonic as
compared to osmotic concentration of our skin
cells. The washing solution, therefore, causes
exosmosis in the skin cells that come in contact
with if for sometime. Because of it, the skin over
the fingers shrinks while washing clothes for a
longtime.
(ii) Sheela was worried because her fingers
had shrunk. But she didn’t know that after
sometime her fingers will come back to their
original shape.

Q. 3. Osmosis is the movement of water molecules
from solution with lower solute concentration
(hypotonic solution) to the solution with higher
solute concentration (hypertonic solution) through
a selectively permeable membrane. The movement
takes place due to the osmotic gradient created by
difference in concentration of the solutions on
both sides of the membrane and the end result
is a state where osmotic equilibrium is reached
wherein movement of the fluid ceases.
(a) What is the importance of osmosis in daily life ?
Give four examples.
(b) Is it useful for plants or not ?
Ans. (a) (1) When your hands are immersed in
dishwater for a long time, your skin looks
bloated. This is an effect of osmosis.
		(2) When you pour salt onto a slug, water
diffuses and slug shrinks as a result of
osmosis.
		(3) When you cook food and put sauce in the
liquid part of your dish, some part of the
solute moves inside the solid part of the
food you are cooking. The solid part could
be an egg, piece of meat but the sauce is
made of solute and not water, so it will
move into the food.
		(4) Osmosis also plays an important part in the
body. It helps in the transfer of water and
various nutrients between blood and fluid
of cells.
		(5) Reverse osmosis is a type of osmosis which
is used to convert sewage water into clean

TOPIC - II
and permanent tissues.
Structure and functions of Animal
Tissues .... P. 71
Meristematic tissues may be apical, lateral or intercalary,
depending on their location in the plant.
Permanent tissues are classified into simple and complex
tissues. Simple tissue shows only one type of cells whereas
complex tissues consist of more than one type of cells, functioning as a unit.
Three types of simple permanent tissues are parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma.
Parenchyma is a supporting and storing tissue, composed of unspecialized, thin-walled cells with large
intercellular spaces.
Collenchyma cells are elongated, with irregularly thickened cell walls. It provides mechanical support
and elasticity to the plant.
The main supporting tissue, sclerenchyma, consists of long and narrow cells with thick, lignified cell
walls.
Parenchyma and collenchyma are living tissues whereas sclerenchyma is a dead tissue.
Epidermis is the outer protective covering of the plant and is usually layered by cuticle.
Stomatal pores, present in the epidermis, are essential for transpiration and gaseous exchange.
In older plants, many layered cork is seen, made up of dead and compactly arranged cells.
Xylem and phloem are important types of complex tissues in plants.
Xylem is composed of tracheids, vessels, xylem parenchyma and xylem fibres. It conducts water and
minerals from roots to aerial parts of the plant.
Phloem consists of sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem fibres and phloem parenchyma. It transports
food from leaves and storage organs to all other parts of the plant.

KNOW THE TERMS

Tissues : A group of specialized cells with similar structure, working together to perform a common
function.

66 ]

Oswaal CBSE (CCE) Question Bank (Term-1), SCIENCE, Class – 9

Meristematic tissue : Tissue made up of actively dividing cells, present in the growing areas of the plant body.
Apical meristem : Meristem present at the growing tips of stem and root that cause the stem and root to increase
in length.
Lateral meristem : Meristem located on the lateral portion of the plant and responsible for increasing the girth of
its stem and root.
Intercalary meristem : Meristem found between already differentiated tissues, in locations such as the base of
leaves or internode.
Permanent tissue : A well-differentiated plant tissue derived from meristematic tissue, which has lost its ability to
divide.
Differentiation : The process by which a cell attains a permanent shape, size and function.
Simple permanent tissue : A permanent tissue composed of only one cell type.
Complex permanent tissue : A permanent tissue composed of more than one type of cells which coordinates to
perform a common function.
Chlorenchyma : Parenchyma whose cells contain chloroplasts and hence performs photosynthesis.
Aerenchyma : Parenchyma containing large air cavities, providing buoyancy to aquatic plants and allowing the
circulation of gases.
Xylem : The complex tissue that conducts water and minerals in vascular plants and composed of tracheids,
vessels, fibres, and parenchyma.
Phloem : The food-conducting tissue of vascular plants, consisting of sieve tubes, companion cells, fibres and
parenchyma.
Epidermis : The outermost, protective layer of cells covering the surface of a plant.

Structure and functions of Animal Tissues
QUICK REVIEW

Animal tissues are grouped into 4 basic types – epithelial, connective, muscular and nervous tissue.
Epithelial tissues are the covering or protective tissues which act as a barrier between the various systems of the
body. It rests on a basement membrane and is composed of tightly packed cells.
Connective tissue is the binding and supporting tissue of the animal body. Matrix forms the main bulk of this
tissue, whereas the cells are loosely spaced and less in number.
Blood, bone, ligament, tendon, cartilage, areolar tissue and adipose tissue are important connective tissues
present in our body.
Blood is a fluid connective tissue in which RBCs, WBCs and platelets are suspended and plays a significant role
in the process of transportation.
Functions of protection, providing skeletal framework and anchoring are carried out by the strong and hard bone
tissue.
Ligaments connect bones to bones whereas tendons connect bones to muscles.

72 ]

Oswaal CBSE (CCE) Question Bank (Term-1), SCIENCE, Class – 9

Cartilage provides support and flexibility to the body parts.
Areolar tissue repairs the injured tissues and fills spaces within organs. These are found between the skin and
muscles, around blood vessels and nerves and in bone marrow.
Adipose tissue serves as a fat reservoir and also carries out the function of insulation. It is found below the skin
and between internal organs.
All movements in our body are brought about by the muscular tissue through the contraction and relaxation of
their contractile proteins.
Striated, unstriated and cardiac are three types of muscle tissues.
Nervous tissue is present in the brain, spinal cord and nerves.
Neuron is made up of cell body, dendrites and axon.
Neurons are specialized to receive and conduct impulses rapidly.

KNOW THE TERMS

Stratified epithelium : An epithelium composed of multiple layers of cells, with only the basal layer being in
contact with the basement membrane.
Ligament : A fibrous connective tissue that connects (or binds) bones to bones.
Tendon : A fibrous connective tissue that connects bones to muscles.
Voluntary muscles : Muscles which can be controlled according to our will.
Involuntary muscles : Muscles which are not under the control of the will.
Multinucleate cell : Cell containing more than one nucleus.
Uninucleate cell : Cell containing only one nucleus.
Neuron : A cell of the nervous system specialized to conduct nerve impulses and made up of cell body, axon and
dendrites.
Impulse : An electrical signal transmitted along a nerve fibre in response to a stimulus.

Ans. (i) Squamous epithelium
(ii) Ciliated epithelium

Q. 14. What will happen if :
(i) Apical meristem is damaged or cut ?

(ii) Cork is not formed in older stems and roots ?
(iii) Lymph is not returned to blood ?
Ans. (i) If apical meristem is removed or damaged then
growth in length of the plant will stop.
(ii) If cork is not formed in older stems and roots,
the outer tissues will rupture with the increase
in girth and expose the interior to desiccation
and infection.
(iii) Blood volume will decrease during passage of
materials from tissues to blood and vice versa.
		

Ans. Every organism be it unicelluar or multicellular
needs to perform a lot of functions like respiration,
digestion, locomotion etc. Cells that are present
in group and specialise in one particular function
form tissues. Some tissues help in growth, some in
locomotion, some in body movement. So if tissues
are not present in bodies of living organism, then
these kind of highly organised and specialised
processes will become disorganised. There will be
no co-ordination in the functioning of cells and
body.

Q. 17. What is Synapse ? Explain.

(HOTS)

Ans. It is a junction between two neurons without
developing an organic union. The terminal
branch end of an axon comes in near contact with

a dendrite terminal. A narrow fluid filled space
occurs between the two. An activated axon end
passes out a neurotransmitter like acetylcholine
which provides sensation to dendrite terminal. This
helps in transfer of impulse from one neuron to the
next.

Ans. All cells of our body look different in terms of
shape, size as will as structure as they are needed
for different functions at different parts of the body.
Cells in our body have no demarcation on the
basis of dividing and non-dividing tissue. Cells
Specialised in one function are often grouped
together in the body.

Q. 6. Describe the structure of bone and cartilage. 		
(DDE 2014; NCERT)
Ans. Bone : Bone is a solid, hard porous tissue. It is
produced by osteocyte cells. It forms the natural
skeleton and gives the body its basic structure and
also supports the body. Its matrix is impregnated
with phosphates and carbonates of calcium and
magnesium which provides hardness to it. The
matrix also contains ossein protein. The matrix
is arranged in concentric rings which are called
lamellae.
Bone cells lie between the lamellae in fluid-filled
spaces called lacunae. Bone cells are also called
osteocytes.

A physical quantity which has both magnitude and direction is called as vector quantity. e.g., velocity,
force.
A physical quantity which has only magnitude is called as scalar quantity. e.g., time, speed.
The S.I unit of distance and displacement is metre.
A body is said to be in uniform motion, if it travels equal distances in equal intervals of time.
A body is said to have non-uniform motion if it travels unequal distances in equal intervals of time.
Speed is the ratio of distance travelled to the time taken to cover that distance.
In non-uniform motion, speed of an object is not constant. The S.I. unit of speed is m/s.
Average speed of a body is the total distance travelled divided by the total time taken.
Velocity is displacement per unit time. The S.I. unit of velocity is metre per second.
Average velocity is displacement divided by the time taken.
Speed is a scalar quantity and velocity is a vector quantity.
Time is independent variable, plotted along X-axis. Distance is dependent variable, plotted along Y-axis in
distance time graph.
Graphs are designed to make it easier for the reader to interpret and understand numerical data.
The distance-time graph is a straight line parallel to time axis when the object is at rest.
The nature of distance-time graph is a straight line when the object is in the state of uniform motion.
Slope of the distance-time graph gives the speed of the object.
A more steeply inclined distance-time graph indicates greater speed. The nature of distance-time graph is
a curve having varying slope when the object has non-uniform motion.

If the velocity of a body remains constant, the velocity-time graph is a horizontal line parallel to the time axis.


If the velocity of the body changes uniformly at a constant rate, the velocity-time graph is a straight line.


If the velocity of the object changes non-uniformly, the velocity-time graph is a curve having increasing slope.


The area enclosed by the velocity-time graph and the time axis represents the displacement.


The slope of the velocity-time graph gives the acceleration.


When a body travels along a circular path of constant radius with a constant speed then its motion is uniform
circular motion.


In a uniform circular motion, velocity of a particle is not constant but its speed is constant, hence it is an accelerated
motion.

KNOW THE TERMS

Distance : The distance covered by a moving object is the actual length of the path followed by the object.
Distance is a scalar quantity. SI unit of distance is Metre .


Displacement is the shortest distance covered by a moving object from the point of reference (initial position
of the body), in a specified direction. SI unit of displacement is metre. Displacement is a vector quantity, i.e., the
displacement is given by a number with proper units and direction.


Uniform Speed : An object is said to be moving with uniform speed if it covers equal distances in equal intervals
of time.


Non-uniform : An object is said to be moving with variable speed or non-uniform speed if it covers equal distances
in unequal intervals of time or vice-versa.


Average speed : The speed of a moving body at any particular instance of time, is called instantaneous speed.
When we travel in a vehicle the speed of the vehicle changes from time to time depending upon the conditions
existing on the road. In such a situation, the speed is calculated by taking the ratio of the total distance travelled
by the vehicle to the total time taken for the journey. This is called the average speed.


Instantaneous Speed : When we say that the car travels at an average speed of 60 km/h it does not mean that the
car would be moving with the speed of 60 km/h throughout the journey. The actual speed of the car may be less
than or greater than the average speed at a particular instance of time.


Velocity : It is defined as the distance covered by a moving object in a particular direction in unit time or speed in
a particular direction.
			
				


Velocity =
v =

distance travelled in a specified direction
time taken
s
t

[where ‘s’ is the distance covered and ‘t’ is the time taken]

Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity of a moving body with time.

					
					
					

Acceleration = Rate of change of velocity with time
=
a =

change in velocity
time
v−u
t


Uniform Acceleration : If the change in velocity in equal intervals of time is always the same, then the object is
said to be moving with uniform acceleration. Example : a body falling from a height towards the surface of the
earth.


Non-uniform or Variable Acceleration : If the change in velocity in equal intervals of time is not the same, then
the object is said to be moving with variable acceleration.


Uniform velocity : A body is said to be moving with uniform velocity if it covers equal distances in equal intervals
of time in a specified direction.

[ 87

MOTION

Variable velocity : A body is said to be moving with variable velocity if it covers unequal distances in equal
intervals of time and vice-versa in a specified direction or if it changes the direction of motion.
l Circular motion : Motion along circular track is called circular motion. An object moving along a circular track with
uniform speed is an example for a non-uniform motion because the direction of motion of the object goes on changing
at every instant of time. Example : A car negotiating a curve with uniform speed. A circle can be considered as a
polygon with infinite sides and hence motion along a circular path is classified as non-uniform motion.

Q. 4. What is the difference between uniform velocity
and non-uniform velocity ?(Board Term I, 2010; 11)
Ans. Uniform Velocity : An object with uniform velocity
covers equal distances in equal intervals of time
in a specified direction e.g., an object moving with
speed of 40 km h–1 towards west has uniform velocity.
Non-uniform Velocity : When an object covers
unequal distances in equal intervals of time in a
specified direction, or if the direction of motion
changes, it is said to be moving with a non-uniform
or variable velocity. e.g., revolving fan at a constant
speed has variable velocity.
1+1
Q. 5. What do you understand by instantaneous
velocity?
(Board Term I, 2010)
Ans. Instantaneous velocity is the velocity of a body
at any particular instance during its motion. For
example, the instantaneous velocity of a motorcycle at a particular instance is 40 kmh–1 if it is
moving at 40 km h–1 at that particular instance. It is
measured by the speedometers on the vehicles. 2
Q. 6. What is non-uniform or variable acceleration ?
(Board Term I, 2010)
Ans. If the velocity of an object changes by unequal
amounts in equal intervals of time, the object is
said to be in non-uniform or variable acceleration
e.g., if the speed of a bus travelling along a straight
road increases by unequal amounts, then the bus is
moving with non-uniform acceleration.
2
Q. 7. What is negative acceleration ? (Board Term I, 2010)
Ans. If the velocity of a body decreases with time, then its
final velocity is less than the initial velocity and thus
its acceleration is negative. Negative acceleration is
called retardation or de-acceleration.
For example, when brakes are applied to a moving
truck, its velocity gradually decreases. In other
words, it is under retardation.

Q. 8. What are the characteristics of the distance-time
graph for an object moving at a uniform speed ?
(Board Term I, 2010; 11)
Ans. The characteristics of distance-time graph for an
object moving with uniform speed are :
(i) It is always a straight line.
(ii) The uniform speed of the moving object is
equal to the slope of the straight line plotted.

Q. 1. Define speed and velocity. Write their SI units.
A body is moving with a velocity of 15 m/s. If the
motion is uniform, what will be the velocity after

(Board 2015, Set-LOV7LN7)
Ans. Speed is the distance travelled by an object in a
given time. Its SI unit is m/s. Velocity is the speed of
an object moving in a definite direction. SI unit of
velocity is same as speed i.e. m/s. As the motion of
the body is uniform the velocity remains constant
i.e. 15 m/s even after 10 s (acceleration is also zero).

Q. 14. A train travels at a speed of 60 km/hr for 0·52 hr,
at 30 km/h for the next 0·24 hr and then at 70 km/h
for the next 0·71h. What is the average speed of the
train ?
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-015; 050)
Ans. (i) In the first case, the train travels at a speed of
60 km/h for a time of 0·52 h.
Now, Speed =

distance
time

= 60 km/hr
...(1)

Distance = 60 × 0·52 = 31·2 km

(ii) In the second case, the train travels at a speed
of 30 km/h for a time of 0·24 hr.

rounds.
Hence if it begins its motion from A, it will reach
till B after 6 min.

distance
time

= 30 km/hr
...(2)

Distance = 30 × 0·24 = 7·2 km

(iii) In the third case, the train travels at a speed of
70 km/h for a time of 0·71 hr.
Now, Speed =

distance
time

= 70 km/hr
...(3)

Distance = 70 × 0·71 = 49·7 km
From equation 1, 2 & 3 we get,
Total distance travelled
		
= (31·2 + 7·2 + 49·7) km = 88·1 km.

Total time taken = (0·52 + 0·24 + 0·71) hr =

(Sec)

Ans. Satellites revolve around their planets in almost
circular orbits with constant speed. Thus, during
their motion, the speed remains constant, while
the direction of motion changes continuously. As a
result, there is a change in their velocity. Therefore,
the motion of satellites around their planets is
considered as accelerated motion.

QUICK REVIEW


SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT


Force is a push or pull acting upon an object.
Balanced forces : The resultant of all the forces acting on a
TOPIC - 1
body is zero.
Force, Motion and Acceleration .... P. 109
Unbalanced forces : The resultant of all the forces acting on
TOPIC - 2
a body is not zero.
Inertia and Conservation of
Newton’s first law of motion states that a body at rest will
Momentum .... P. 124
remain at rest and a body in motion will remain in uniform
motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
The net force acting on the object is zero, whenever
balanced forces act on it.
The momentum of an object is the product of its mass and velocity and has the same direction as that of
the velocity. Its SI unit is kg-m-s–1.
Newton’s second law of motion states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly
proportional to the force and takes place in the same direction as the force.
Force is also defined as the product of mass and acceleration.
The SI unit of force is kg-m-s–². This is also known as Newton and represented by the symbol N.
A force of one Newton produced an acceleration of 1 m-s–² on an object of mass 1 kg.
Force of friction always opposes motion of objects.
Two forces resulting from the interaction between two objects are called action and reaction forces
respectively.
Action and reaction forces act on two different bodies but they are equal in magnitude.
Newton’s third law : For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction; but action and reaction act
on different bodies.

KNOW THE TERMS


Force : A force is physical quantity which causes or tends to cause a motion in an object at rest or changes
or tends to change the direction of motion of a moving object or changes or tends to change the size and
shape of an object or changes or tends to change the speed of an object.
Balanced Force : When two forces of equal magnitude acts in opposite directions on an object simultaneously,
then the object continues in its state of rest or a uniform motion in a straight line. Such forces acting on the
object are known as balanced force.

110 ]


		

Oswaal CBSE (CCE) Question Bank (Term-1), SCIENCE, Class – 9

Unbalanced Force : When two forces of unequal magnitudes act in opposite directions on an object simultaneously,
then the object moves in the direction of a large force. These forces acting on the object are known as unbalanced
force.

Momentum : Momentum of a body is equal to the product of the mass (m) of the body and the velocity v of the

body. It is denoted by p .
Momentum = mass × velocity.
Recoil Velocity : The velocity with which the gun moves backward after firing a bullet is known as recoil velocity.
Friction : Whenever a body slides or rolls over the surface of another body, a force comes into action which acts
in the opposite direction of the motion of a body. This opposing force is called ‘friction’.
Resultant Forces : The resultant force or resultant of several forces acting simultaneously on a body is that single
force which produces the same effect on a body as all these forces together produce.

Short Answer Type Questions-I
Q. 1. Derive Newton’s first law of motion from the
mathematical expression of the second law of
motion.
[Board 2015, Set-LOV7LN7]
Ans. Newton’s first law states that a body stays at rest if
it is at rest and moves with a constant velocity unit
if a net force is applied on it. Newton’s second law
states that the net force applied on the body is equal
to the rate of change in its momentum.
		
F = ma
m( v − u)
or
F =
t
or
Ft = mv – mu
That is, when F = 0, v = u for whatever time, t is
taken. This means that the object will continue
moving with uniform velocity, u throughout the
time, t. If u is zero than v will also be zero, i.e., object
will remain at rest.			
2
Q. 2. Why is it easier to stop a tennis ball in comparison
to a cricket ball moving with the same speed ?		
(DDE 2014; Board 2010)
Ans. Tennis ball is lighter (less mass) than a cricket
ball. Tennis ball moving with same speed has less
momentum (mass × velocity) than a cricket ball. It
is easier to stop tennis ball having less momentum.

Q. 3. Two objects having their masses in ratio 3 : 5 are
acted upon by two forces each on one object. The
forces are in the ratio of 5 : 3. Find the ratio in their
accelerations.
(Board 2011, 2010)
Ans. Since masses are in ratio 3 : 5.
Let the mass of the objects be 3x and 5x.
Let F1 and F2 be the two forces with a1 and a2
accelerations.
		
F1 = m1a1 = 3xa1
and
F2 = m2a2 = 5xa2
Since
F1 : F2 = 5 : 3, we have
		
3xa1 : 5xa2 :: 5 : 3
⇒
a1 : a2 = 5 × 5 : 3 × 3
⇒
a1 : a2 = 25 : 9

Q. 5. Using a horizontal force of 200 N, we intend to
move a wooden cabinet across a floor at a constant
velocity. What is the friction force that will be
exerted on the cabinet ? (Board Term 1, 2011, 2010)
Ans. A friction force (here it is kinetic or sliding friction)
always acts parallel to surface but in direction of
the opposing motion. Since the wooden cabinet
is moving with uniform speed, a horizontal force
of 200 N acts on it. According to Newton’s III law
of motion, forces are balanced. Hence, a frictional
force of 200 N is exerted on the cabinet.

Q. 6. It is difficult to balance our body when we
accidentally slip on a peel of banana. Explain why ?
(Board Term 1, 2011, 2010)
Ans. A frictional force always acts parallel to the surface
and is directed to oppose sliding. Banana skin
reduces friction (or frictional force) and thus brings
body in unbalanced state and we tend to fall.

FORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION

Q. 7. If action is always equal to the reaction, explain
how a horse can pull a cart. (Board Term 1, 2010)
Ans. According to Newton’s third law of motion, action
force is equal to reaction but acts on two different
bodies and in opposite directions. When a horse
pushes the ground, the ground reacts and exerts
a force on the horse in the forward direction. This
force is able to overcome friction force of the cart
and it moves.

Q. 8. A man pushes a box of mass 50 kg with a force of
80 N. What will be the acceleration of the box due
to this force ? What would be the acceleration if
the mass were doubled ?(Board Term 1, 2011, 2010)
Ans. Given, mass of the box (m) = 50 kg
Force (F) acting on box = 80 N
Acceleration (a) = ?
Since
Force (F) = mass (m) × acceleration (a)
F

⇒
a =

If mass is doubled m1 = 2 × 50 = 100 kg

Thus, the acceleration will be halved if the mass is

Q. 9. Why does a man jumping out of a moving train fall
with his head forward ?
(Board 2011; 2010)
Ans. As the man jumps out from a moving train, his feet
suddenly come to rest on touching the ground while
his body’s upper part continues to move forward.
For this reason he falls with his head forward. So
as to save himself, he should run through some
distance in the forward direction.

Q. 10. A hammer of mass 500 g, moving at 50 m/s, strikes
a nail. The nail stops the hammer in a very short
time of 0·01 s. What is the force of the nail on the

(Board Term 1, 2010; 11)
Ans. Given, mass of hammer
		
(m) = 500 g = 0·5 kg
Initial velocity of hammer
(u) = 50 m/s
Final velocity of hammer
		
(v) = 0 m/s

applied. Calculate the force exerted by brakes.
Mass of truck is 1200 kg.
		 (DDE 2014; Board Term I, 2012 Set-077)
Ans. (a) According to first law of motion, everybody
tends to resist change of state whether in rest
or in motion. Qualitatively this tendency of the
body to stay at rest or keep moving with same
velocity is called inertia.
(b) Cricket ball (because its mass is larger, so inertia

applied.
		(2) Force is balanced.
Unbalanced forces :
		(3) The box starts moving, when the applied
force is increased.
		(4) Force is unbalanced.
(ii) (a) Unbalanced : because the box is coming
down with increasing velocity.

g moving at 5·0 m/s striking it. Consider that the
nail stops the hammer in a short time of 0·01 s.
(DDE 2014; Board Term I, 2012 Set-033)

Ans. Newton’s 2nd law of motion states that the force
acting on a body is directly proportional to the
product of its mass and acceleration produced by it
in the body.
OR
The rate of change of momentum of a body is
directly proportional to the force applied on it and
the change takes place in the direction of applied
force. Suppose a body of mass m is acted on by a
force F.
Mathematical derivation :
If the force ‘F’ changes its velocity from u to v in
time t, then rate of change of momentum can be
written as
(mv – mu)

		(ii) negative acceleration produced on it.
		(iii) positive force acting on the marble
			
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-052)

(Board Term I 2013, 7ZTHA8G)

Ans. The force acting on a body is directly proportional
to the rate of change of momentum of the body,
according to Newton’s second law.
Force is equal to 1 newton if it produces an
acceleration of 1 m/s2 in a body of unit mass.
(i) By reducing the speed of hand suddenly,
the player decreases the time of change of
momentum. This increases the impact of force
exerted on the tile.
(ii) When athletes fall on a soft surface, their
velocity becomes zero in a longer duration
of time. Thus, rate of momentum change
decreases and less force is exerted by ground
on their body.

Q. 2. During the training Sahil’s cricket coach taught
him to pull his hands backwards while catching a
fast moving cricket ball.
(a) Was Sahil’s coach correct ?
(b) Why does a fielder in the ground gradually
pull his hands backwards with the ball, while
catching a fast moving cricket ball ?

(c) What would happen if a fielder does not take
the advice properly ?
(d) What value is associated with it ?
Ans. (a) Yes.
(b) While catching a fast moving cricket ball, a
fielder pulls his hands backwards with the
ball. By doing so, the fielder increases the time
during which the high velocity of the moving
ball decreases to zero. Thus the acceleration of
the ball is decreased and therefore the impact
of catching the fast moving ball is also reduced
and the fielder gets less hurt.
(c) On the contrary, if the ball is stopped suddenly,
the high velocity decreases to zero in a very
short interval of time. Thus the rate of change of
momentum of the ball is very large. Therefore,
large force is applied for holding the catch that
might hurt the palm of the fielder.
(d) This shows that Sahil’s coach is intelligent and a
good trainer.

Inertia and Conservation of Momentum
QUICK REVIEW
The property by the virtue of which an object tends to remain in the state of rest or of uniform motion unless
acted upon by some force is called inertia.
l The mass of a body is a measure of inertia.
l Inertia is the inability of a body to change its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line by itself.
l The inherent property of a body by virtue of which it cannot change its state of rest is called inertia of rest.
l Law of conservation of momentum : The sum of momentum of the two objects before collision is equal to the sum
of momentum after the collision provided there is no external unbalanced force acting on them.
l Effects of force are :
		 (a) It can produce motion in stationary bodies.
		 (b) It can stop moving bodies.
		 (c) It can change the speed and direction of motion of bodies.
		 (d) It can also bring about change in dimensions of a body.

Q. 1. State why Newton’s first law of motion is called
law of inertia.
(DDE 2014; Board 2011; 2010)
Ans. Inertia is a tendency of the object to resist change
in its state. Newton’s first law of motion also states
similar i.e., the object will remain in its present state
unless an external force is applied. That’s why
Newton’s first law is called Law of inertia.

Q. 2. Which is having higher value of momentum ? A
bullet of mass 10 g moving with a velocity of 400
m/s or a cricket ball of mass 400 g thrown with the
speed of 90 km/hr.
(Board 2011)
Ans.
		

Momentum (P) = mass (m) × velocity (v).
Mass of bullet = 10 g = 10 × 10–3 kg

			 = 10–2 kg
		

Velocity of bullet = 400 m/s

Detailed Answer :
Activity :
 Take a test tube of good quality glass material
and put a small amount of water in it. Place a
stop cork at the mouth of it.
 Now suspend the test tube horizontally by two
strings or wires as shown in fig.
 Heat the test tube with a burner until water
vaporises and the cord blows out.
 Observe that the test tube recoils in the direction
opposite to the direction of the cork.

 Also, observe the difference in the velocity the
cork appears to have and that of the recoiling
test tube.
Hence, the total momentum of the two objects
is unchanged or conserved by the collision.
Q. 2. Which accident will be more damaging, collision
between two trucks moving with a speed of 50km/
hr. or collision between two cars moving with a
speed of 50 km/hr. ? Explain.
		
(Board 2014, Set-MNM9GZH)
Ans. Colision between trucks, because more is the
mass, more is the inertia and therefore more is the
momentum. Mass of the trucks is more than that of
cars so collision of trucks will cause more damage. 3
Q. 3. A body of mass 4 kg is dropped from a height
of 20 m. Calculate the initial momentum and
the momentum just before it strikes the ground
(g = 10 m/s2)
(Board 2014, Set-SO1QHXJ)
Ans.		
v2 = u2 + 2gh
		
02 = u2 + 2 × 10 × 20
		
02 = u2 + 400
		
u2 = 400
u = 400 = 20
		
		
Momentum = mass × velocity
			 = 4 × 20
			 = 80 kg m/s2

Ans. (a) No. It is not the violation of law of inertia.
Law of inertia is obeyed only when no
external force acts on a body. But in this case
the friction due to the ground acts on the ball,
so it comes to rest.
(b) Player lowers his hand because by doing so
he increases the time in which velocity of
ball comes to zero. This decreases the rate of
change of momentum and so the impact of
force is reduced.

FORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION

Ans. Inertia : Inability of the body to change by itself its
state of rest or state of uniform motion.
Activity :
(i) Apply some force on a football.
(ii) It flies away as it has small inertia.
(iii) Apply same force on same size of stone.
(iv) Stone hardly moves as it has more inertia.

Q. 8. State the law of Inertia. Why do we fall in forward
direction if a moving bus stops suddenly and fall
in the backward direction if it suddenly accelerates
from rest ?
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-041)
Ans. Law of Inertia : An object remains in its state of
rest or of uniform motion in a straight line until an
external unbalanced force acts on it.
When a moving bus stops suddenly, the bus slows
down but our body tends to remain in state of
motion due to inertia of motion. Sudden start of
bus brings motion to the bus as well as our feet
but rest of the body still has inertia of rest due to
which we fall backwards.

Q. 9. When a fast moving horse stops suddenly a
careless rider falls in the forward direction. Give
reason for it.
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-019)
Ans. It is because of inertia of motion. When the horse
was in motion, the whole body of the rider was
in motion. But when the horse stops suddenly the
lower portion of the rider which is in contact with
the horse comes to rest but the upper portion of
him wants to remain in motion.

(b) A cricket player lowers his hand while catching
a ball. Why ?
(c) Why does a glass pane of a window gets
shattered when a flying pebble hits it ?
		
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-016)
Ans. (a) Due to inertia of direction, wheels rotate at
high speed and mud sticking to the wheel flies
off tangentially.
(b) This increases the time of catching, decreases
the acceleration of the ball, hence force exerted on the hands decreases.
(c) High velocity of pebbles, decreases to zero in
a very short interval of time for which it remains in contact with glass pane and shatters
the glass pane.

If a body of mass (m) moves with a velocity (v), then
momentum p is given by,
p = mv
Law of conservation of Momentum : When no
external force acts on a body, its momentum will

Long Answer Type Questions
Q. 1. What is meant by ‘inertia’ ? What are different
types of inertia ? Give two examples in each case.
		
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-042)
Ans. Inability of the body to change by itself its state of
rest or state of uniform motion is called inertia.
Types : Inertia of rest : e.g. :

5 Marks each
(c) Explain how a karate player can break a pile of
tiles with a single blow of his hand.
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-021)

		

Ans. (a) Momentum is the product of mass and
velocity.
SI unit of momentum is -kgm/s.
(b) v2 = u2 + 2gh
		

v2 = (0)2 + 2(10) (5)

		

v2 = 100 \ v = 10 m/s

		

momentum = m × v

			 = 10 × 10 = 100 kg m/s
(c) The karate player strikes the pile of tiles with
his hand very fast. In doing so, the large
momentum of fast moving hand is reduced
to zero in a very short time. This exerts a
very large force on the pile of tiles which is
sufficient to break them.

u1 = 2 m/s u2 = 1 m/s v1 = 1·67 m/s
v2 = ?
According to law of conservation of momentum
		 m1u1 + m2u2 = m1v1 + m2v2
		 0·1 × 2 + 0·2 × 1 = 0·1 × 1·67 + 0·2 × v2
		
0·2+ 0·2 = 0·167 + 0·2 v2
		
v2 = 1·165 m/s

Value Based Questions
Q. 1. Akhtar, Kiran and Rahul were riding in a motorcar
that was moving with a high velocity on an
expressway when an insect hit the windshield and
got stuck on the windscreen. Akhtar and Kiran
started pondering over the situation.
(a) Kiran suggested that the insect suffered a
greater change in momentum as compared
to the change in momentum of the motorcar
(because the change in the velocity of the insect
was much more than that of the motorcar).
(b) Akhtar said that since the motorcar was
moving with a larger velocity, it exerted a
larger force on the insect. And as a result the
insect died.
(c) Rahul while putting an entirely new
explanation said that both the motorcar and
the insect experienced the same force and a
change in their momentum.
Comment on these suggestions.
Ans. Since both car and insect are moving with uniform
speed, and there is no external force applied. Hence,
total momentum is conserved, i.e.
		(mcuc) + (miui) = (mc – mi) v
⇒ (1500 × 25) + (0·01 × – 5)
		
= (1500 + 0·01) × v
					
(values are assumed)
⇒
37500 – 0.05 = 1500·01 × v
⇒
37499·95 = 1500·01 × v

⇒

v = 377499.95 = 24·9998 m/s
1500.01

		
So velocity of insect changes from – 5 m/s to
24·9998 m/s				
(big change)
		Velocity of car changes from 25 m/s to 24·9998 m/s 		
		 (almost a negligible change)
Change in momentum of the car
		
= (mcv) – (mcuc) = mc(v – uc)		
= 1500 × (24·9998 – 25)
		
= – 0·3 N-s
Change in momentum of the insect
		
= (miv) – (miui) = mi(v – ui)
		
= 0·01 × ( 24·9998 + 5) = 0·3 N-s
⇒ The momentum gained by the insect is equal to
the momentum lost by the car.
(a) Kiran is incorrect in terms of change in
momentum. However she is correct, the change
in velocity of insect is higher than that of the
car.
(b) Akhtar observation is correct that speed of
car is higher than that of insect. However he
is incorrect that the insect experiences larger
force. According to Newton’s third law of
motion both experienced same amount of force.
(c) Rahul is correct that both experienced same
force. If he says the amount of change in
momentum in both objects is same, then he is
correct.

QUICK REVIEW


SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT


According to the law of gravitation, the force of attraction between any two objects is proportional to the
product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The law
applies to objects anywhere in the universe. Such a law is said to be universal.
Universal gravitational constant G = 6·67 × 10-11 Nm2 kg–2·
Gravitation is a weak force unless large masses are involved.
Acceleration with which a body falls towards the centre of the earth is called acceleration due to gravity
(g).
The force of gravity decreases with altitude. It also varies on the surface of the earth, decreasing from
poles to the equator.
Mass is the quantity of matter contained in the body.
Weight of the body is the force with which the earth attracts the body.
The weight is equal to the product of mass and acceleration due to gravity.
Mass of a body does not change but weight of a body is different at different places.
The upward force exerted by a liquid when a body is immersed in the liquid is called up thrust or buoyant
force.
The force of gravity decreases with altitude. It also varies on the surface of the earth, decreasing from
poles to the equator.
All objects experience a force of buoyancy when they are immersed in a fluid.
Objects having density less than that of the liquid in which they are immersed, float on the surface of
liquid. If the density is more, it sinks in the liquid.
Inverse square rule states that F is inversely proportional to the square of d.
Weight of an object on the moon is one-sixth time of its weight on the earth.
Archimedes principle can be stated as when a body is immersed fully or partially in a fluid, it experiences
an upward force that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it.
Applications of Archimedes’ principle - use in designing ships and submarines, lactometers, hydrometers.
The relative density is a ratio of similar quantities, thus has no unit.

KNOW THE TERMS

Density : Mass of a unit volume. Its unit is kg m–3.
Relative density of a substance is the ratio of its density to that of water.
Thrust : Force acting on a body perpendicular to its surface.
Gravitation : It is the force of attraction between any two bodies in the universe.

[ 131

GRAVITATION

Gravity : It is the force of attraction between the earth and any object lying on or near its surface.


Pressure : Force acting per unit area of the object.


Newton’s universal law of gravitation : This law states that everybody in this universe attracts every other body
with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square
of the distance between them.

		Mathematically,
F=G

		 where G is universal gravitational constant.

Universal gravitational constant : It is equal to the force of attraction between two bodies of unit mass each
placed at a unit distance apart. It is denoted by G and its value is 6.67 × 10–11 Nm2/kg2.


Centripetal acceleration of the moon : If the moon is revolving with speed v in a circular orbit of radius r, then
acceleration acting on it along the radius and towards the centre of its orbit is
ac =

			

v2
.
r


Free fall : The motion of a body under the influence of force of gravity alone is called a ‘free fall’.


Acceleration due to gravity : The acceleration produced in the bodies due to earth’s force of gravity is called
acceleration due to gravity. Its value on earth’s surface is 9.8 m/s2.


Centre of mass : The centre of mass of a body may be defined as the point at which whole mass of the body may
be assumed to be concentrated.


Centre of gravity : The centre of gravity of a body is a point at which the resultant of all the parallel forces due to
gravity experienced by various particles of the body acts or at which whole of the body acts.


Projectile : Any object thrown into space with some initial velocity and which moves thereafter under the
influence of gravity alone is called a ‘projectile’. The path of a projectile is a parabola. Its horizontal range is
maximum when the angle of projection is 45°.


Weightlessness : The state when an object does not weight anything during free fall.


Buoyancy : An upward force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of an immersed object.

Ans. Gravitational force is attractive in nature always. 1
Q. 23. Why does a body reach the ground quicker at poles
than at the equator when dropped from the same
height ?
Ans. The acceleration due to gravity is more at the poles
than at the equator. The time taken by a body is
smaller if the acceleration due to gravity is more
when the initial velocities and the distance travelled
are the same. So, when dropped from the same
height a body reaches the ground quicker at poles
than at the equator.
1
Q. 24. When does an object show weightlessness ?
Ans. Weightlessness is a state when an object does not
weigh anything. It occurs only when a body is in a
state of free fall under the effect of only gravity. 1
Q. 25. How was Galileo able to conclude that the
acceleration of an object falling freely towards the
earth does not depend on the mass of the object ?
Ans. Galileo climbed to the top of the Leaning Tower
of Pisa in the presence of a large gathering, and
dropped spheres of different masses and materials
from the top simultaneously. All the spheres
reached the earth’s surface at the same time. So, he
concluded that the acceleration of an object falling
freely towards the earth does not depend on the
mass of the object.

Ans. Drop two balls with different mass from a tall
building at the same time. They will reach the
ground at the same time. Both the balls are at free
fall and their initial velocity is same, that is zero.
You know that s = ½ gt2.
So the only way that they touch the ground at
the same time is that acceleration is same for both
the balls. This experiment proves that during

equal and opposite force. Why then we see only
the stone falling towards the earth but not the
earth rising towards the stone ?
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-045)

Q. 1. A man’s weight when taken at the poles is 600 N.
Will his weight remain the same when measured at
the equator ? Will there be an increase or decrease
is his weight ? Explain. 		
(Board 2015, Set-LOV7LN7)
Ans. No, his weight will not remain same as that at the
poles. There will be a decrease in his weight at the
equator. As the radius of the earth increases from
the poles to the equator, the value of ‘g’ becomes
greater at poles decreasing towards equator. Also,
the force of gravity decreases from poles to the
equator.

using a sensitive balance.
(ii) Free fall : Whenever objects fall towards the
earth under the gravitational force alone, we can
say that the objects are in free fall. While falling
there is no change in the direction of motion
of the objects. But due to earth’s attraction,
there will be a change in the magnitude of the

Ans. Refer 10.11 page 132 NCERT book
(i) The force that binds us to earth.
(ii) The motion of the moon around the earth.
(iii) The motion of planets around the sun.
(iv) The tides due to the moon and the sun.
(CBSE Marking Scheme, 2015) 3
Detailed Answer :
Universal law of gravitation states that the force of
attraction between two objects is proportional to the
product of their masses and inversely propotional
to the square of the distance between them.
Four phenomena which can be explained by this
law are :
(i) The force that binds us to earth.
(ii) The motion of the moon around the earth.
(iii) The motion of planets around the sun.
(iv) The tides due to the moon and the sun.
Q. 8. The weight of a body on the surface of the earth is
392 N. What will be the weight of this body on a
planet whose mass is double that of the earth and
radius is four times that of the earth.
		
(Board 2014, Set-LFS3I7K)
Ans. Let the mass of earth be ‘M’ and its radius be ‘R’
Then the acc. due to gravity (g) = GM/R2 = 9.8 m/
s2 where G is the Gravitational Constant.
Mass of the planet = 2M
		Radius of the planet = 4R
Hence, acc. due to gravity on that planet (g’) =
G2M/(4R)2
			 = 2GM/16R2
			 = 1/8 (GM/R2)
			 = 1/8 × 9.8 = 1.225 m/s2
Weight of the body on earth = 392 N
Hence, its mass will be (392/9.8) = 40 kg
So, its weight on that particular planet will be (40
× 1.225) = 49 N (CBSE Marking Scheme, 2014) 3

the value of G.
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-031)
Ans. The force of gravitation exerted by earth (or any
other planet) on the objects on its surface is called
gravity. Every object attracts every other object
due to the force of gravitation. So, gravity is a

(a) The velocity with which it was thrown up.
(b) The maximum height it reaches.
(c) Its position after 4 s.
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-051)
Ans. (a) Acceleration due to gravity, g = – 9·8 ms–2
As the time to go up and return is 6 s.
 6 s
∴ The time to go up, t = 3 s

Q. 25. To estimate the height of a bridge over a river, a
stone is dropped freely in the river from the bridge.
The stone takes 2 s to touch the water surface in
the river. Calculate the height of the bridge from
the water level.
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-040)
Ans. The stone is being dropped freely from rest,
so the initial velocity of the stone, u = 0. Again,
the velocity of the stone is increasing as it comes
down, so the acceleration due to gravity ‘g’ is to be
taken as positive.
Here, Initial velocity u = 0 m/s

the lift begins to fall freely under the gravity, what
is the force with which the body presses on the
floor ?
(Board Term I, 2012 Set-049)
Ans. When the lift is falling freely under the gravity,
⇒
s = 88·2 m – 44·1 m
then the body of weight 600 N kept in it also falls

s = 44·1 m
freely under the action of gravity. In this case the

Consider the earth to be a sphere of mass M and
radius R, as shown in the figure. Suppose a body
of mass m situated at distance r from the centre of
the earth.
As we know, according to Newton’s law of
gravitation, the force of attraction between the
earth and the body is given by
		

F = GmM /r2

Q. 4. Sunil threw a ball while standing on the jumping
board of a swimming pool, which is at a height of

the same board with initial velocity u. Both the
balls hit the water together.
(i) Find the initial velocity with which the second
ball was thrown.
(ii) Do the two balls hit the water with the same
velocity ? Explain.
(NCERT Based)
Ans. (i) For the first ball,
Initial velocity, u = 0 m/s; distance covered,
s = 30 m; acceleration, a = g = 10 m/s2
Now, using the second equation of motion,
1 2
s = ut +
at
2

⇒
s = ut + gt2

Substituting the values in the above equation,
we get
1
45 = 0 × t + × 10 m/s2 × t2
2
		
		
45 = 5 m/s2 × t2
		
t2 = 9s2 ⇒ t = 3s
Thus, the first ball takes 3 s to reach the water
surface.
For the second ball,
initial velocity, u = ?; distance covered, s = 45
m; time taken, t = 3s – 1s = 2s

Now, again using the second equation of
motion,
1
s = ut + at2

1 2
⇒
s = ut + gt
2
1

× 10 m/s2 × (2s)2
2
		
45 = u × 2 s + 20 m
⇒
u = 12·5 m/s
(ii) Velocities of the two balls when they hit the
water :
If v1 is the velocity of the first ball,
		
v1 = u + at = u + gt
			 = 0 + 10 m/s2 × 3 s = 30 m/s
If v2 is the velocity of the second ball,
		
v2 = 12·5 m/s + 10 m/s2 × 2 s
			 = 32·5 m/s
Thus, the two balls hit the water surface with
different velocities. The second ball hits the water
with higher velocity.

(ii) What was its velocity when it touched the
ground ?
(iii) Make table showing the distance, velocity and
acceleration at the end of each second of the
journey of the stone.
(iv) Plot distance-time, velocity-time and
acceleration-time graphs. (NCERT Based)
Ans. Since, height of the tower,
		
h = 245 m
		Initial velocity of the particle,
		
u = 0 m/s
(i) Time taken by the stone to reach the ground, t = ?
		Using the equation,
		
h = ut + 1 gt2, we get
2
⇒
245 = 0 × t + 1 × 10 × t2
2
⇒
t = 7 sec
		Thus, the measured time was incorrect.
(ii) Final velocity, when the stone touched the
ground,

In India, cows and buffaloes are used for draught labour and producing milk and are called draught animals and
milky animals respectively.
Long lactation period is a desirable quality in milky animals.
Exotic breeds showing long lactation is cross bred with local breeds showing resistance to diseases to obtain high
quality breeds.
For good health and milk production, proper cattle management is required such as shelter, feeding, breeding
and disease control.
The cattle shelter should be well-ventilated, hygienic and dry.
Cattle food should include roughage and concentrates in balanced amounts and are required for the healthy
maintenance as well as milk production of the cattle.
Cattle diseases are caused by external and internal parasites as well as by bacteria and viruses. These affect the
health as well as milk production of the animals and can be largely controlled through vaccinations.
Poultry farming targets egg production and broiler production for chicken meat.
Cross-breeding is done between the Indian and foreign breeds of poultry to obtain improved varieties containing
desirable traits such as tolerance to high temperature, dwarf broiler parent, low maintenance requirements and
reduction in size of the layers.
The shelter, feeding and other requirements of broilers and layers differ from each other.
The diet of broilers is planned with the aim of achieving good growth rate and quality of carcass whereas the diet
of layers is aimed to achieve large number and high quality of eggs.
Broiler diet is rich in proteins and vitamins, along with the required amount of fat.
The poultry shelter should be hygienic, well-lighted and maintained at appropriate temperatures.
Poultry need to be protected from various diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses, parasites and nutritional
deficiencies, through proper treatment, sanitation and vaccination.
In fish production, both the finned true fish as well as shellfish are obtained from marine or fresh water through
capture fishing or culture fishery.
India’s marine fishery resources are the vast coastlines and extensive seas; the freshwater resources are canals,
ponds, reservoirs and rivers whereas the brackish water fishery resources are estuaries and lagoons.
In India, marine fishes such as pomphret, tuna, mackerel and sardines are located through satellites and echo
sounders and captured using fishing nets.
Marine fish farming of high economic value fishes like mullets, oysters and prawns are done in sea water.
Freshwater fish production is mainly carried out through aquaculture.
Composite fish culture system is used commonly for fresh water fish farming. In this system, five or six fish
species with different food habits are farmed together in a single pond, so as to increase the yield of fish.
Since high quality fish seed is not always available, fish are now-a-days bred using hormonal stimulation, thus
ensuring continuous supply of the seed.
Bee-keeping is a low investment activity carried out by farmers to obtain honey and wax.
Apis cerana indica, Apis dorsata and Apis florae are the Indian bee varieties whereas Apis mellifera is an Italian variety
used for commercially producing honey.
The availability of sufficient amount of pasturage as well as the type of flowers decide the quality of honey.

Manures contain decomposed animal and plant wastes and increase soil nutrition and fertility.
The bulk organic matter present in manure improves soil structure.
In composting, the biological waste material is decomposed in pits. Composting done using earthworms is called
vermi-composting.
In green manuring, green crops are grown, mulched by ploughing and mixed with soil to improve soil structure
and fertility.
The commercially produced fertilizers provide macronutrients like N, K and P and ensure healthy growth of
plants.
Excessive use of fertilizers causes water pollution and loss of soil fertility.
A best crop yield is obtained by a balance between the use of fertilizers and manures.
In organic farming, use of chemicals is discouraged whereas use of organic manures, bio-agents and healthy
cropping systems is encouraged.
Irrigation is essential to ensure agricultural success in India since our agriculture is mainly rain-fed.
Wells, canals, rivers and tanks are some important irrigation systems in our country.
The source of wells is underground water whereas canals get water from rivers or reservoirs. River lift systems
draw water directly from rivers.
Rainwater harvesting and watershed management increase storage of rain water for later use in agriculture.
Risk of crop failure is reduced in mixed cropping wherein two or more crops are grown together on the same
field.
Two or more crops with different nutritional requirements are grown on the same farm in inter-cropping so as to
utilize maximum nutrients and prevent spread of diseases and pests.
In crop rotation, different crop combinations are grown on the same field in a pre-planned succession so as to get
maximum returns.
Weeds, pests and diseases can destroy large amounts of crop plants.
Weed removal from crop fields is essential since they use up the requirements of crop plants like food, space, light
etc.
Insect pests and plant pathogens attack different parts of the plant and thus reduce crop yields.
Pesticides are used to control weeds, insects and diseases, but they should be used only as much as needed to
avoid environmental pollution and health hazards.

Several preventive methods can be adopted to carry out pest and weed control.
Biotic and abiotic factors can cause huge storage losses of food grains that can be taken care of by proper treatment.
l It is better to use preventive and control methods for protecting crops such as proper cleaning and drying of the
crops followed by fumigation, rather than treatment measures.

Q. 3. “Continuous use of fertilizers destroys soil
fertility”. Hence long term use of fertilizers is
substituted by different cropping pattern. Discuss
three new techniques of cropping pattern of their
significance.
		
(Board 2014, Set - LFS3I7K, Set-MNM9GZH)
Ans. Three different cropping patterns, namely mixed
cropping, intercropping, and crop rotation are
generally practised.
(i) Mixed cropping allows two or more crops to be
sowed simultaneously in the same land. Wheat
and gram, wheat and mustard, ground nut and
sunflower etc. are some common examples of
mixed cropping. Mixed cropping also increases
soil fertility by maintaining microbial diversity.
In mixed cropping, crops are chosen in such
a way that they require different amounts of
minerals.
(ii) Intercropping allow farmers to grow two or
more crops simultaneously in the same field in
a definite pattern. For example, cauliflower and
chilli plants are grown together in alternating
rows. To ensure the maximum utilization of
nutrients applied, crops are selected in such
a way that their nutrient requirements are
different. Other examples include soyabean
and maize, finger miller (bajra) and cowpea
(lobia) etc.
(iii) Crop rotation is the practice of growing two
or more varieties of crops in the same region
in sequential seasons. A common example of
crop rotation is to cultivate maize followed by
soyabean. This system also helps in preventing
crops from pests and diseases. The crops
selected, vary in nutrient requirements. This
ensures complete and uniform utilization of
nutrients.

Q. 9. Define fumigation and fumigant. Give an example
of a fumigant. How does fumigation differ from
spraying ? Give two points.
		

(Board Term I, 2012 Set-070)

Ans. Fumigation is a method in which the insecticide
solution is converted into fumes to kill the insects;
fumigants are the insecticides which are used for
making such fumes.
Example : EDB (Ethylene di-bromide).
In fumigation, the solution is converted into
fumes and it is done during the storage of food

Catla, Rohu, Mrigals, Common Carps and Grass
Carps cultured in the same pond.
(a) Name the type of fish farming observed by the
student.
(b) Mention the advantages of such a farming
system.
(c) What is the main problem in such a form of
fish farming ? How do farmers overcome such
problems ?
Ans. (a) Composite fish culture.
(b) In such a system, a combination of five or six
fish species is bred in a single fish pond. These
species are selected so that they do not compete
for food among them. As a result, food available
in all parts of the pond is used. This increases
the fish yield from the pond.
(c) Most of the fish breed in monsoon only and
even if fish seed is collected from wild it can
be mixed with other species as well. So major
problem is lack of availability of good food.

This problem can be overcomed by breeding
these fishes using hormonal stimulation.
