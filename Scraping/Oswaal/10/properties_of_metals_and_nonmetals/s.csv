"State reason for the following :  Non-metals cannot displace hydrogen from the acids.  Hydrogen is not a metal, yet it is placed in the activity series of metals.  Aluminium is more reactive than iron, yet its corrosion is less than that of iron. "," Non-metals are electron accepters, they cannot supply electrons so as to convert H+ ion to H2.

"Give reasons for the following :  Metals conduct electricity.  Reaction of nitric acid with metals generally does not evolve hydrogen gas.  For making gold ornaments, 22 carat gold is preferred to 24 carat gold."," Metals conduct electricity because they have electrons which are free to move. They offer little resistance to the flow of current. Silver and copper are the best conductors of electricity.  Reaction of metals with nitric acid does not evolve hydrogen gas. It is because HNO3 is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises H2 to produce water and itself gets reduced to any of its oxides such as N2O, NO or NO2.  Pure gold is 24 carat and is very soft. Therefore, it is not suitable for making jewellery. It is alloyed with Cu or Ag to make it hard. Generally, 22 carat gold is used for making ornaments, which contains 22 parts of pure gold and 2 parts of either Cu or Ag. 3"
Give reasons for the following :  Aluminium is a reactive metal but is still used for packing food articles.  Calcium starts floating when water is added to it. , Because it forms a protective oxide layer around itself preventing complete reaction and also does not affect the food at all.

Pour some water in test-tube-1, cork it.  Pour water  in test-tube-2, add some oil and cork it.  Put some anhydrous calcium chloride in test-tube-3 and cork it.  After 2-3 days, we observe that the nails in test-tube 1 rust because they are exposed to air and water both, while nail in test-tube 2 and 3 do not rust. This shows that rusting of iron takes place in the presence of air and moisture both."
"You are given samples of three metals : Sodium, magnesium and copper. Suggest any two activities to arrange them in order to their decreasing reactivity. ","Different metals react with oxygen at different rates. e.g., Sodium  and potassium  catch fire, if left in open. Hence, these are the most reactive metals. To prevent accidental fires, these metals are kept immersed in kerosene oil. Magnesium burns in air only by heating. So, it is less reactive than sodium and potassium. Copper  does not burn on heating but blister copper burns. Hence the order of reactivity of these metals with oxygen is : Na > Mg > Cu. Metals react with water to produce a metal oxide and hydrogen gas. Sodium  and potassium  react violently with cold water. So the reaction is violent and exothermic. Magnesium  does not react with cold water. It reacts with hot water. Metals like lead, copper, silver do not react with water at all. The reactivity series of metals towards water is : Na > Mg > Cu."
