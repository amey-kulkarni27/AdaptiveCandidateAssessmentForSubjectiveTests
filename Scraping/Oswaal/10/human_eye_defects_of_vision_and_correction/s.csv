2,"Q. 5. Name the type of defect of vision a person is suffering from, if he uses convex lenses in his spectacles for the correction of this vision. If the power of the lenses is +0.5 D, find the focal length of lenses. ","Ans. Rods and cones are light sensitive cells present in the retina. Rods control the intensity of light, while cones control the colour perception ."
3,"Q. 2. State the structure of iris and its function in human eye. [Board Term II, Set-8XSVHLC, Set-QNA4XWT, 2014]",Ans. Just behind the cornea is a dark coloured muscular diaphragm which has a small circular opening in the middle. Iris is made of muscles. They control the size of opening of pupil. 
4,"Q. 6. How is a normal eye able to see distinctly distant as well as nearer objects ? What is the distance of distinct vision ?  [Board Term II, Set (2008), 2012]","Ans. Eye lens is made up of fibrous material. Its curvature can be changed by ciliary muscles which changes its focal length. When muscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin and focal length increases and the eye is able to see distant objects. Similarly when ciliary muscles contract, focal length decreases and eye is able to see nearer objects. The minimum distance at which objects can be seen distinctly is called distance of distinct vision. It is 25 cm.  1"
5,"Q. 7. An old person is unable to see clearly nearby object as well as distant objects : (i) What defect of vision is he suffering from ? (ii) What kind of lens will be required to see clearly the nearby as well as distant objects ? Give reason. [Board Term II, Set (2007), 2012]",Ans. (i) Presbyopia. (ii) He shall have to use both kinds of lenses. Convex lens for long sightedness and concave lens for short-sightedness. 
6,Q. 8. When a person is said to have developed cataract? How is the vision of such a person restored ?,"Ans. When the crystalline lens of eye becomes hazy (or ever opaque) due to the formation of thin membrane over it, this causes partial or complete loss of vision. This defect of eye is called cataract. The vision of the defected eye can be restored by the cataract surgery. When we enter a dim room, it takes some time so that the pupil expands and allows more light to enter and helps to see things clearly."
7,Q. 10. Why does it takes some time to see objects in a cinema hall when we just enter the hall from bright sunlight ? Explain in brief. ,Ans. (i) The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light entering the eye.
8,Q. 9. Why does it take some time to see the objects (ii) How does the thickness of the eye lens change when we shift looking from a distant tree to reading a book ?  in a dim room when we enter the room from bright sunlight outside ? ,"Ans. In bright light, the size of the pupil is small to control the amount of light entering the eye. (ii) In bright sunlight, the size of the pupil is small and when we enter the cinema hall it takes some time for the pupil to expand in size due to dim light. 1"
9,Q. 11. (i) What is meant by least distance of distinct vision ?,"Ans. (i) It is the minimum distance to which, normal eye can see two similar object distinctly. (ii) Eye lens is comparatively thicker, while reading a book."
10,"Q. 1. State one main function each of iris, pupil and cornea. ","Ans. (i) Iris : Gives colour to eyes, controls size of pupil. (ii) Pupil : Regulate amount of light. (iii) Cornea : Refracts most of the light into eyes.  1+1+1"
11,Q. 2. What is meant by the term ‘power of accommodation‘ of human eye ? How does it help a person to see nearby as well as distant objects clearly ?  How are we able to see nearby and also the distant objects clearly ? (NCERT Exemplar),"Ans. Power of accommodation of human eye : The ability of eye lens to adjust its focal length to form the sharp image of the object at varying distance on the retina is called its power of accommodation. The curvature of eye lens can be changed (i.e. change in its focal length) to some extent by the ciliary muscles. When we are looking at the nearby objects, the ciliary muscles contract, it increases the thickness of eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker. As a result, the focal length of eye lens decreases in such a way that the clear sharp image of nearby object is formed on the retina. Thus, the object is seen clearly to us. When we are looking at the distance objects, these muscles are in relaxed position, the eye lens becomes thinner, focal length of the lens increases. Therefore, the parallel rays coming from the distant object are focussed on the retina and object is seen clearly to us. Thus, the accommodation power of an eye helps a person to see nearby as well as distant objects clearly. (3 marks each)"
12,Q. 3. (i) What is meant by ‘least distance of distinct vision’ ? (ii) How does iris controls the size of the pupil in bright light and dim light ?,"Ans. (i) The minimum distance at which objects can be seen most distinctly without strain is called the least distance of distinct vision. (ii) In bright light, the iris contracts the pupil to allow less light to enter the eye. In dim light, the iris expands the pupil to allow more light to enter the eye."
13,"Q. 4. With the help of ciliary muscles the human eye can change its curvature and thus alter the focal length of its lens. State the changes that occur in the curvature and focal length of the eye lens while viewing (a) a distance object, (b) nearby objects. Explain, why a normal eye is not able to see distinctly the object placed closer than 25 cm, without putting any strain on the eye. ","Ans. (i) When we see distant objects, the ciliary muscles relax/expand to decrease the curvature and thereby increase the focal length of the lens. Hence, the lens becomes thin. This enables us to see the distant object clearly. Thus, the focal length of the eye lens increases while seeing distant objects. Image Light coming from distant object (ii) To see the nearby objects clearly, the focal length of the lens should be shorter. For this, the ciliary muscles contract to increase the curvature and thereby decrease the focal length of the lens Hence, the lens becomes thick. This enables you to see the nearby objects clearly. A bifocal lens consists of both convex lens and concave lenses. The convex lens used in bifocal lens is used to correct hypermetropia (far-sightedness) and concave lens is used to correct myopia (shortsightedness)."
14,Q. 5. (i) What are the values of (a) near point and (b) far point of vision of a normal adult person ? (ii) A person with a myopic eye cannot see objects beyond 1.2 m directly. What should be the type of the corrective lens used ? What would be its power? ,"Ans. (i) (a) 25 cm, (b) Infinity (∞). (ii) To correct, an objects at ∞ has to be brought at an image to 120 cm. f f = –120 cm P= D = – 0.83 D A concave lens of focal length 120 cm and power –0.83 D is to be used."
15,Q. 6. Due to gradual weakening of ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the eye lens a certain defect of vision arises. Write the name of this defect. Name the type of lens required by such persons to improve the vision. Explain the structure and function of such a lens. (Delhi,Ans. (i) Hypermetropia.

17,"Q. 9. (i) Draw a diagram to show the formation of image of a distant object by a myopic eye. How can such an eye-defect be rectified ? (ii) State two reasons due to which this eye defect may be caused. [Board Term II, Set (2018), 2012]",Ans. (i) Diagram. by concave lens It can be rectified. (ii) Due to excessive curvature of lens or elongation of eye ball. 
18,Q. 10. Write about power of accommodation of human eye. Explain why the image distance in the eye does not change when we change the distance of an object from the eye ? ,Ans. The ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called power of accommodation. The focal length of the eye lens is adjusted so that the image distance does not change. Thus the image distance is equal to distance from the centre of the eye lens to the retina.
