A person with myopic eye cannot see object beyond 1.2 m distinctly. What should be the type of the corrective lens used to restore proper vision ?,"The far point for myopic eye is 1.2 m , u = – ∞, v =–1.2 m 		Using lens formula We get v u f P= = 0.83 D"
Why is a normal eye not able to see clearly the objects placed close than 25 cm ?  3,"Focal length of the eye lens cannot be reduced below a certain limit. If an object is placed very close to the eye lens less than 25 cm, the ciliary muscles cannot contract further to make eye lens more thick. So, eye lens become unable to form sharp image on the retina. Therefore, we cannot see an object clearly if it is placed very close to the eye i.e. less than 25 cm. 3"
Why is a concave lens used to correct myopia or short- sightedness ?,A concave lens of suitable focal length diverges the parallel rays from the distant objects as if they are coming from the far point F of the myopic eye. This helps the eye lens to form a clear image at the retina.
"A hypermetropic person prefers to remove his spectacles, while driving. Give reason.","When a hypermetropic person wearing the spectacles looks at a distant object, the parallel rays from the distant object get converged in front of the retina. The image appears blurred, in order to avoid this, the person prefers to remove his spectacles. 3"
Explain why ?  Myopic person prefer to remove his spectacles while reading a book.  A hypermetropic person prefer to remove the spectacles while looking at the sky?," Myopic person does not need spectacles while reading a book as he has the near point at 25 cm. If such person reads the book with corrective lens  he will have to keep the book at distance greater than 25 cm so that the image of book will be formed by the concave lens at 25 cm and moreover, the size of the book that appear to him is also smaller. Therefore, the person prefer to remove his spectacles while reading a book.  Hypermetropic person does not need spectacles to see distant objects as he has the far point at infinity. If such person uses spectacles  to see the distant objects, the image will be formed, before retina due to increase in converging power and hence the person cannot see distant object distinctly. Therefore such persons prefers to remove spectacles while looking at the sky."
How does the colour of the scattered light depend on the size of the colloidal particles ?,"The colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering particles. Very fine particles having size less than the wavelength of visible light mainly scatter blue light of shorter wavelength of the visible spectrum. The particles of relatively larger size scatter light of longer wavelengths. The large particles such as raindrops, dust and ice particles scatter white light."
Dispersion is caused by refraction not by reflection. Why ?,"The reason is that for a given angle of incidence, the angle of reflection is same for all the wavelengths of white light while the angle of refraction is different for different wavelengths."
What is Tyndall effect ? What is its causes ? Name two phenomena observed in daily life which are based on Tyndall effect.,"Tyndall effect : When a beam of light is passed through a colloidal solution, placed in a dark room, the path of beam becomes illuminated when observed through a microscope placed perpendicular to the path of light. This effect is called Tyndall effect. Cause of Tyndall effect : The size of the colloidal particle is relatively larger than the solute particle of a true solution. The colloidal particles first absorb energy from the incident light and then scatter a part of this energy from their surfaces. Thus, Tyndall effect is due to scattering of light by the colloidal particles and the colloidal particles are seen to be moving as points of light moving against a dark background. Some daily phenomena based on Tyndall effect are as follows :  When a fine beam of sunlight enters a smoke filled room through a small hole, the smoke particles become visible due to the scattering of light.  When sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense forest, the tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light and become visible."
What will be the colour of sky in the absence of atmosphere ?,"In the absence of atmosphere, there will be no scattering of sunlight and the sky will appear dark. This is what astronauts actually observe at heights at 20 km above the earth where the atmosphere becomes thin."
