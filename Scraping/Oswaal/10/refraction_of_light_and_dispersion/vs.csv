0,Q. 1. What is meant by dispersion of light ? ,Ans. The splitting of light into its component colours is called dispersion of light.
1,Q. 2. What is tyndall effect ? ,Ans. Water droplets present in the atmosphere.
2,Q. 4. Which coloured component bends the least during the dispersion of white light through prism ? ,Ans. Red.
3,"Q. 5. Which colour of white light suffers (i) least deviation and (ii) maximum deviation when a beam of white light passes through a glass prism ?  Name the component of white light that deviates the least and the most while passing through a prism.[Board Term II, Set (2016), 2012]",Ans. (i) Least deviation – Red. (ii) Maximum deviation – Violet. 
4,"Q. 6. On which factor does the colour of the scattered white light depend ? [Board Term II, Set (2044), 2012]",Ans. Size of the particles of the medium through which it is passing.  1
5,"Q. 7. The sky appears dark to passengers flying at a very high altitude. Why ? [Board Term II, Set (2036), 2012]","Ans. Due to lack of atmosphere, scattering is not prominent."
6,Q. 8. The sky appears dark instead of blue to an astronaut. State its reason. (ii) Name the colour that deviates least and the one which deviates most while passing through a glass prism.   ,Ans. The sky appears dark to the astronaut as scattering does not take place at very high attitude due to the absence of atmosphere.
7,Q. 9. What is the cause of dispersion of light on passing through a prism ? ,"Ans. The refractive index of the material of a prism is different for different colours of light as different colours have different speed in the material of a prism. Also, prism has non–parallel surfaces."
