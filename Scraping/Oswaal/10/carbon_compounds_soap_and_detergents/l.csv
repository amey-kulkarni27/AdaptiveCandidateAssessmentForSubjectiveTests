0,Q. 1. Soaps and detergents are both types of salts. State the difference between the two. Write the mechanism of the cleansing action of soaps. Why do soaps not form lather (foam) with hard water ? Mention any two problems that arise due to the use of detergents instead of soaps.  (5 marks each),"Ans. Soaps are the sodium or potassium salts of long chain carboxylic acids while detergents are the ammonium of sulphonate salts of long chain carboxylic acids.  The dirt is oily in nature and when soap is added to water, its molecules form structures called micelles in which carbon chain of the molecules dissolves in the oil while the ionic end dissolves in water and faces outside. The micelles thus help in dissolving the dirt in water. (Note : 1 mark to be awarded if only labelled diagram of micelle is given)  Ca2+ and Mg2+ present in hard water form insoluble substance (scum) with soap.  Two problems : (i) Non-biodegradable (ii) Water pollution / soil pollution 		 (Note : 1 mark to be awarded for any one of the problems.) S.No. Soap Detergents (i) They are sodium These are sodium salts of long chain or potassium fatty acids. salts of sulphonic acids of hydrocarbons. (ii) Soaps cannot be Detergents work used with hard well with hard water. and soft water both. (iii) They are fully They are non-bibiodegradable. odegradable. (iv) They take time to They dissolve dissolve in water. faster in water. Cleansing Action of Soap : When soap is dissolved in water, it forms a colloidal suspension. In this colloidal suspension, the soap molecules cluster together to form micelles and remain radially suspended in water with the hydrocarbon end towards the centre and the ionic end directed outward. The dirt particles always adhere to the oily or greasy layer present on the skin or clothes. When a dirty cloth is dipped into a soap solution, its nonpolar hydrocarbon end of micelles gets attached to the grease or oil present in dirt and polar end remains in water layer. The mechanical action of rubbing subsequently dislodges the oily layer from the dirty surface shaping it into small globules. A stable emulsion of oil in water is formed. The emulsified oil or grease globules bearing the dirt can now be readily washed with water. Soaps do not form lather when the water is hard. When soap is added to hard water, calcium and magnesium salts present in water displace sodium or potassium ions from the soap molecules forming an insoluble substance called scum. Problems that aries due to use of detergents instead of soap : (i) Detergents being non-biodegradable, they accumulate in the environment causing pollution. (ii) In soil, the presence of detergents leads to pH changes making soil infertile. (iii) The entry of detergents into food chain leads to bioaccumulation in living beings and tends toward serious health issues. (Any two) 5"
1,Q. 2. What are micelles ? Why does it form when soap is added to water ? Will a micelle be formed in other solvents such as ethanol also ? State briefly how the formation of micelles help to clean the clothes having oily spots.  Why does micelle formation takes place when soap is added to water ? Will a micelle be formed in other solvents such as ethanol also ? ,"Ans. (i) Soap molecules have two ends– one end is the hydrocarbon chain which is water repellent, where as the other end is the ionic part which it water soluble end. When soap is dissolved in water it forms a group of many molecules, known as micelle. (ii) These micelles are formed because their hydrocarbon chains come together and the polar ends are projected outwards. (iii) Micelle formation in ethanol will not occur because the hydrocarbon chain end of the soap will dissolve in ethanol. (iv) Soaps in the form of micelle are able to clean dirty clothes having oily spots, as the oily dirt is collected in the centre of the micelle, which forms an emulsion in water and on rinsing, the water washes away the micelles with dirt attached to them.

10,Q. 14. Make the structure of methane by showing sharing of electrons between carbon and hydrogen atoms. How could you convert methane into chloroform by substitution reaction? Explain with the help of chemical reactions. ,"Ans. Methane, CH4 Hydrogen atoms can form one covalent bond, while carbon atoms can form four covalent bonds. Four pairs of electrons are shared in a methane molecule (CH4). When a mixture of methane and chlorine is exposed to ultraviolet light - typically sunlighta substitution reaction occurs and the organic product formed is chloromethane.
