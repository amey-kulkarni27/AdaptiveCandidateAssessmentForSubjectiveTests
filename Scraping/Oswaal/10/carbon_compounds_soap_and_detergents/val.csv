Ravi read the formation of covalent bonds and came to know the property of carbon. Carbon has four valence electrons. It cannot lose four electrons since very high amount of energy will be required to lose four electrons to form C4+. Carbon cannot gain four electrons to form C4– ion as six protons cannot hold 10 electrons easily and there will be strong interelectronic repulsion  What is the atomic number and electronic configuration of carbon ?  Explain how covalent bonding is important between carbon compounds. Give any two suggestions.  2," Atomic number of carbon = 6. Electronic configuration of carbon = 2, 4.   Carbon forms maximum number of compounds due to covalent bonding.  Carbon compounds have covalent bonds due to which they are poor conductors of electricity. They do not contain ions or free electrons to conduct electricity."
"Ethanol, commonly called as ‘alcohol’ is an excellent solvent, it is used in medicines and is an important chemical compound involved in synthesis of many chemical compounds. However is in spite of its benefits to man, its impact on social behaviour has always been questioned. Media has often shown abnormal behaviour of people while drunk. It is considered as a curse in the lives of those who are addicted to alcohol. ‘Alcoholic’ people are not only lowering their metabolism and affecting central nervous system, they are also a threat to the liver of others. Anger and rude behaviour are some of its ill effects.  Comment on the statement : ‘Should production of alcohol be banned’. Give three valid reasons to justify.  As a student, what initiative would you take in the common concern of ‘Save Life, Do not Drink’. Give two suggestions.", In favour of negative response :  It is an excellent industrial solvent.  It is used in so many ways such as in medicines and ornamentation.  It is used as a disinfectant. In favour of positive response :  It is the reason behind deaths of many people.  Many adolescents get affected out of it and become addicted.  It is being misused even where it is of important use.  Initiatives :  Drive to increase awareness among people with the help of skit / role plays / drama / article writing.  Chart preparation and slogan writing.
