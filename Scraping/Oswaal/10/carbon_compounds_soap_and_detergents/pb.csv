A student is studying the properties of acetic acid. List two physical properties of acetic acid he observes. What happens when he adds a pinch of sodium hydrogen carbonate to this acid ? Write any two observations. ,"Acetic acid is colourless liquid. It is miscible/soluble in water.  On adding a pinch of sodium hydrogen carbonate, Brisk effervescence is observed.

What precautions should be taken while studying the properties of ethanoic acid ?, Handle ethanoic acid carefully.  Add only small amount  of NaHCO3 or Na2CO3 to ethanoic acid to control the intensity of CO2 evolved.
What type of reaction takes place between CH3COOH and NaOH solution ? Where do you find the use of ethanoic acid in day to day food products ?,"Neutralization reaction. It is used in the form of vinegar, which is a dilute solution of ethanoic acid in water."
"A student takes 2 ml acetic acid, in a dry test-tube and add a pinch of sodium hydrogen carbonate to it. Write down the observation made by the students ?",A colourless and odourless gas is evolved. It turns lime water milky and this gas extinguish­ es the burning splinter.
"When you add about 2 ml of acetic acid to a testtube containing an equal amount of distilled water and leave the test-tube to settle after shaking its contents, what will you observe in the test-tube after about 5 minutes ?","When acetic acid and distilled water are mixed, they form a clear solution because acetic acid is completely miscible with water."
"A student adds a few drops of ethanoic acid to test tubes X, Y and Z containing aqueous solutions of sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate respectively. If he now brings a burning splinter near the mouth of the test-tubes immediately after adding ethanoic acid in each one of them, in which of the test tube or test-tubes the flame will be extinguished?","Only test tube Z will be extinguished. The flame will be extinguished when test tube Z is brought near a burning splinter due to evolution of carbon dioxide gas, which does not support combustion"
"Among the two test-tubes I and II, one contains acetic acid and another contains water. Which of the given properties of acetic acid can be used to identify acetic acid from it?    Colour change with universal indicator  Reaction with NaHCO3  Colour of the solution  Transparent nature","The two properties of acetic acid can be used to identify acetic acid in the test tube, containing acetic acid and water are: Acetic acid reacts with NaHCO3 and the colour change with universal indicator. 2"
Write the reaction between soap molecules and ions present in hard water.,Ca2  + 2Na+—stearate  ↓ → Ca2  + 2NaHCO3  CaSO4  + 2Na+ – stearate ↓ → Ca2  + Na2SO4 1+1
Is a sample containing dil. HCl hard ? Why ?,Yes. Hydrogen ions provided by HCl makes water hard. H+ + Na+ stearate- → Steric acid + Na+
"While studying saponification reaction for the prep­ aration of soap, a teacher suggested to a student to add a small quantity of common salt to the reaction mixture. Write down the function of common salt in this reac­tion?","Common salt is added in saponification reaction, as it helps in the precipitation of soap by decreasing the solubility of soap."
"While studying saponification reaction, a student measures the temperature of the reaction mixture and also finds its nature using blue/red litmus paper. What conclusion can be drawn from his observations?","Saponification reaction is a highly exothermic reaction. The reaction mixture of this reaction is basic in nature and hence, this will turn red litmus blue."
"On the basis of study of saponification reactions, a group of students noted down the following com­ ments in their notebooks:  The nature of the reaction mixture is basic.  In saponification reactions, heat is evolved.  Saponification reaction is not a neutralization reaction.  Soap is nothing but a salt of fatty acids. Which of these comments is correct according to you?","The correct comments are:  In saponification reactions, heat is evolved.  Saponification reaction is not a neutralization reaction.  Soap is nothing but a salt of fatty acids."
"When the red litmus paper and the blue litmus pa­ per are dipped into the soap solution, what colour changes, will you observe?","Red litmus paper turn blue and blue litmus pa­ per remains colourless, as soap solution is basic in nature."
Rupal took a liquid A in a test-tube and added sodium hydroxide solution in it. The mixture was stirred for some time. Glyceride and solid B are formed after the reaction. Identify A and B?,Olive oil  and sodium hydroxide forms soap .
"For determining the saponification reaction for the preparation of soap, write down the name of any five apparatus that we require?","Beaker, measuring cylinder, thermometer, testtube, glass rod."
Name any two chemicals used for the preparation of toilet soap?,Fat and potassium hydroxide are used to pre­pare toilet soap.
We need 20% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide for the study of saponification reaction. When we open the lid of the bottle containing solid sodium hydroxide we observe it in which form?,Solid sodium hydroxide is stored in the form of white pellets/flake.
Consider the following oils :  Mobile oil  Castor oil  Turpentine oil  Kerosene  Mustard oil  Coconut oil Which of these can be used for preparation of soap?,"Castor oil, Turpentine oil, and coconut oil can be used for preparation of soap."
"In a locality, hard water, required for an experiment, is not available. However, the following salts are available in the school laboratory : 1. Sodium sulphate 2. Calcium sulphate 3. Magnesium chloride 4. Sodium chloride 5. Calcium chloride 6. Potassium sulphate Which of the above salts may be dissolved in water to obtain hard water for the experiment?","Water containing calcium and magnesium salts is known as hard water. Among the given salts, calcium sulphate, magnesium chloride and calcium chloride can be dissolved in water to obtain hard water."
"A student takes about 6 ml of distilled water in each of the four test tubes P, Q, R and S. He then dissolves an equal amount of four different salts namely, sodium chloride in ‘P’, potassium chloride in ‘Q’, calcium chloride in ‘R’ and magnesium chloride in ‘S’. Next, he then adds 10 drops of soap solution to each test tube and shakes its contents. In which of these test tubes the scum  is formed with soap?","Scum is formed by reaction of soap with calcium and magnesium salts in water. Test-tubes R and S contain calcium chloride and magnesium chloride, respectively. Therefore, scum will be formed in these two test-tubes."
A student puts a drop of reaction mixture of a saponification reaction first on a blue litmus paper and then on a red litmus paper. Write down the observation he will observe?,There is no change in blue litmus paper as soap solution is alkaline in nature.
"During saponification reaction, Rupal takes refined oil in a test-tube and adds 20% NaOH solution. She then stirs the reacting mixture. Write down the observation she will observe?",She will observe that soap settles down in the testtube.
Do soaps create water pollution? Give reason in support of your answer?,"No, because soaps are biodegradable."
