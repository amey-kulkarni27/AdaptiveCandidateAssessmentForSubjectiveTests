1,"Q. 2. (a) To construct a ray diagram we use two which are so chosen that it is easy to know their directions after reflection from the mirror. List two such rays and state the path of these rays after reflection in case of concave mirrors. Use these two rays and draw ray diagram to locate the image of an object placed between pole and focus of a concave mirror. (b) A concave mirror produces three times magnified image on a screen. If the object is placed 20 cm in front of the mirror, how far is the screen from the object? ","Ans. (a) (i) Listing of any two (out of four) rays and stating their path after reflection from a concave mirror. (ii) Ray diagram Using these two rays for the ray diagram when the object is in between the pole and the focus of the mirror. (b) u = – 20 cm, m = – 3 v m= −u v = – m*( – u ) 			 = – (– 3) *(– 20 cm) = – 60 cm 		Distance between the object and the screen is 40 cm 			= – 60 cm – (– 20 cm) = – 40 cm  Detailed Answer : (i) Two light rays whose path of reflection are known are : (a) The incident ray passes through the centre of curvature : In this case, light after reflecting from the concave mirror moves back in the same path. This happens because light is incident perpendicular on the mirror surface. (b) The ray incident obliquely to the principal axis : In this case, the incident ray will be reflected back by the reflecting surface of the concave mirror obliquely and making equal angles with the principal axis. (iii) Given, m = – 3, u = – 20 cm, v = ? As we know, v u m=  v  = v = – 60 cm The screen is placed in front of the mirrors at a distance of 60 cm from the pole of the mirror. Thus, the screen is placed 40 cm away from the object. 2"
2,"Q. 3. Suppose you have three concave mirrors A, B and C of focal lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 20 cm. For each concave mirror you perform the experiment of image formation for three values of object distance of 10 cm, 20 cm and 30 cm. By giving reason answer the following : (i) For the three object distances, identify the mirror/ mirrors which will form an image of magnification – 1. (ii) Out of the three mirrors identify the mirror which would be preferred to be used for shaving purposes / makeup. (iii) For the mirror B draw ray diagram for image formation for object distances 10 cm and 20 cm. ","Ans. fa = 10 cm; fb = 15 cm; fc = 20 cm u1 = 10 cm; u2 = 20 cm; u3 = 30 cm (i) m= – 1 means u = 2f, for A → u2, for B → u3 (ii) Mirror B or C – distance should be less than focal length for erect and magnified image, face is generally kept at a distance more than 10 cm. (iii) A' r B' B' Let an object is placed between the focus and pole of the concave mirror. Then using above two rays, image of the candle can be located as shown below : R' t c je ob Q Image Q' The image is formed behind the mirror. The image is virtual, erect and magnified. 1 B A' "
3,"Q. 4. (a) If the image formed by a mirror for all positions of the object placed in front of it is always diminished, erect and virtual, state the type of the mirror and also draw a ray diagram to justify your answer. Write one use such mirrors are put to and why. (b) Define the radius of curvature of spherical mirrors. Find the nature and focal length of a spherical mirror whose radius of curvature is + 24 cm.  LIGHT–REFLECTION AND REFRACTION","Ans. (Topper Answer,2017) Detailed Answer : (a) A convex mirror forms an erect, diminished and virtual image for all the positions of the object placed in front of it. At infinity Convex mirrors are commonly used as rear-view mirrors in vehicles as they always give an erect, though diminished image. (b) The radius of the sphere of which the reflecting surface of spherical mirror forms a part is called the radius of curvature of the mirror. f = 		Radius of curvature, 		So, R = 24 cm f = = 12 cm Thus, the focal length of a convex spherical mirror is 12 cm."

(ii) Will the image be smaller or larger than the object. Draw ray diagram to show the formation of image in this case. (iii) Where will the image of this object be, if it is placed 24 cm in front of the mirror ? Draw ray diagram for this situation also to justify your answer.

5,"Q. 6. A student has focused the image of a candle flame on a white screen using a concave mirror. The situation is as given below : Length of the flame = 1.5 cm Focal length of the mirror = 12 cm Distance of flame from the mirror = 18 cm If the flame is perpendicular to the principal axis of the mirror, then calculate the following : (i) Distance of the image from the mirror (ii) Length of the image If the distance between the mirror and the flame is reduced to 10 cm, then what would be observed on the screen ? Draw ray diagram to justify your answer for this situation.  (ii) At what distance, in terms of focal length ‘f’ of the mirror, should he place the candle flame to get the magnified image on the wall ? (iii) Draw a ray diagram to show the formation of the image in this case. (iv) Can he use this mirror to project a diminished image of the candle flame on the same wall ? State ‘how’ if your answer is ‘yes’ and ‘why not’ if your answer is ‘no.’ ",Ans. (i) He should use a concave mirror as it forms real images. (ii) He should place the candle flame between the focus and centre of curvature of the mirror to get the magnified image on the wall. (iii) The ray diagram for the formation of the image is shown below : v = – 36 cm (b) h' = - v ×h u = -36 cm × 1.5 = – 3 cm 				 -18 cm (Magnified Inverted image) (ii) If u = – 10 cm No distinct image would be formed on the screen In this case the image formed will be virtual (object will be within focal length) (iii) r R' 
6,"Q. 8. (i) 4·5 cm needle is placed 12 cm away from a convex mirror of focal length 15 cm. Give the location of the image and the magnification. Describe what happens as the needle is moved farther from the mirror. (ii) What kind of mirror is used in a solar furnace ? Give reason for using this mirror. (iii) One half of a convex lens is covered with a black paper. Will this lens produce a complete image of the object ? Justify your answer. [Board Term II, Set (2022), 2012]","Ans. (i) h = + 1.5 cm; f = – 12 cm; u = – 18 cm; v = ? h' = ? (a) f v u = – 12 cm =+ 15 cm f u u v v v= = 6·7 cm h −v Magnification m =– h1 u h m= 2 h1 h2 = h1 × m h2 = 0·558 × 4·5 h2 = 2·5 cm As the needle is moved farther from the mirror, image moves to the focus and the size of image goes on decreasing. (ii) Concave mirrors are used in solar furnaces as they concentrate solar energy in the focal plane and help in attaining high temperatures. (iii) When one half of a convex lens is covered with a black paper, the lens will produce a complete image of the object but the intensity of the image is reduced because rays from the top portion of the lens only are refracted and forms the image. 1 "
