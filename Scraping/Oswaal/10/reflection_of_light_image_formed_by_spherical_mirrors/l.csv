0,Q. 1. (a) Define the following terms in the context of spherical mirrors : (i) Pole (ii) Centre of curvature (iii) Principal axis (iv) Principal focus (b) Draw ray diagrams to show the principal focus of a : (i) Concave mirror (ii) Convex mirror (c) Consider the following diagram in which M is a mirror and P is an object and Q is its magnified image formed by the mirror. (5 marks each) (b) (i) State the type of the mirror M and one characteristic property of the image Q. ,"Ans. (a) (i) Pole – Centre of the reflecting surface of the mirror. (ii) Centre of curvature – The centre of the hollow sphere of which the reflecting surface of mirror is a part. (iii) Principal axis – Straight-line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical mirror. (iv) Principal focus – Incident rays parallel to principal axis, after reflection, either converge to or appear to diverge from a fixed point on the principal axis called principal focus of the spherical mirror. (ii) r At Infinity (iii) Concave mirror Image formed is virtual. "
1,"Q. 2. (a) To construct a ray diagram we use two which are so chosen that it is easy to know their directions after reflection from the mirror. List two such rays and state the path of these rays after reflection in case of concave mirrors. Use these two rays and draw ray diagram to locate the image of an object placed between pole and focus of a concave mirror. (b) A concave mirror produces three times magnified image on a screen. If the object is placed 20 cm in front of the mirror, how far is the screen from the object? ","Ans. (a) (i) Listing of any two (out of four) rays and stating their path after reflection from a concave mirror. (ii) Ray diagram Using these two rays for the ray diagram when the object is in between the pole and the focus of the mirror. (b) u = – 20 cm, m = – 3 v m= −u v = – m*( – u ) 			 = – (– 3) *(– 20 cm) = – 60 cm 		Distance between the object and the screen is 40 cm 			= – 60 cm – (– 20 cm) = – 40 cm  Detailed Answer : (i) Two light rays whose path of reflection are known are : (a) The incident ray passes through the centre of curvature : In this case, light after reflecting from the concave mirror moves back in the same path. This happens because light is incident perpendicular on the mirror surface. (b) The ray incident obliquely to the principal axis : In this case, the incident ray will be reflected back by the reflecting surface of the concave mirror obliquely and making equal angles with the principal axis. (iii) Let an object is placed between the focus and pole of the concave mirror. Then using above two rays, image of the candle can be located as shown below : Image Q' The image is formed behind the mirror. The image is virtual, erect and magnified. (iii) Given, m = – 3, u = – 20 cm, v = ? As we know, v u m=  v  = v = – 60 cm The screen is placed in front of the mirrors at a distance of 60 cm from the pole of the mirror. Thus, the screen is placed 40 cm away from the object. 2"
2,"Q. 3. Suppose you have three concave mirrors A, B and C of focal lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 20 cm. For each concave mirror you perform the experiment of image formation for three values of object distance of 10 cm, 20 cm and 30 cm. By giving reason answer the following : (i) For the three object distances, identify the mirror/ mirrors which will form an image of magnification – 1. (ii) Out of the three mirrors identify the mirror which would be preferred to be used for shaving purposes / makeup. (iii) For the mirror B draw ray diagram for image formation for object distances 10 cm and 20 cm. ","Ans. fa = 10 cm; fb = 15 cm; fc = 20 cm u1 = 10 cm; u2 = 20 cm; u3 = 30 cm (i) m= – 1 means u = 2f, for A → u2, for B → u3 (ii) Mirror B or C – distance should be less than focal length for erect and magnified image, face is generally kept at a distance more than 10 cm. 1 B A' "
3,"Q. 4. (a) If the image formed by a mirror for all positions of the object placed in front of it is always diminished, erect and virtual, state the type of the mirror and also draw a ray diagram to justify your answer. Write one use such mirrors are put to and why. (b) Define the radius of curvature of spherical mirrors. Find the nature and focal length of a spherical mirror whose radius of curvature is + 24 cm.  LIGHT–REFLECTION AND REFRACTION","Ans. (Topper Answer,2017) Detailed Answer : (a) A convex mirror forms an erect, diminished and virtual image for all the positions of the object placed in front of it. At infinity Convex mirrors are commonly used as rear-view mirrors in vehicles as they always give an erect, though diminished image. (b) The radius of the sphere of which the reflecting surface of spherical mirror forms a part is called the radius of curvature of the mirror. f = 		Radius of curvature, 		So, R = 24 cm f = = 12 cm Thus, the focal length of a convex spherical mirror is 12 cm."
4,"Q. 5. It is desired to obtain an erect image of an object, using concave mirror of focal length of 12 cm. (i) What should be the range of distance of an object placed in front of the mirror ? (ii) Will the image be smaller or larger than the object. Draw ray diagram to show the formation of image in this case. (iii) Where will the image of this object be, if it is placed 24 cm in front of the mirror ? Draw ray diagram for this situation also to justify your answer. Show the positions of pole, principal focus and the centre of curvature in the above ray diagrams. 		 ",Ans. (i) Range of distance – between 0 cm - < 12 cm (ii) larger than the object (iii) Image also at 24 cm in front of the mirror
