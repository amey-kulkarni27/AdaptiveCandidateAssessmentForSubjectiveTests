0,Q. 1. Define the term principal axis of a spherical mirror. ,"Ans. The line which joins the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical mirror, is the principal axis of a spherical mirror."
1,Q. 2. What is virtual image ?,"Ans. If the rays of light do not actually meet after reflection or refraction, but appear to meet when produced backwards, then that point constitutes virtual image."
2,Q. 3. Define the principal focus of a concave mirror.,Ans. Light rays that are parallel to the principal axis of a concave mirror converge at a specific point on its principal axis after reflection from the mirror. This point is known as the principal focus of the concave mirror.
3,Q. 4. Write two different uses of concave mirrors. ,"Ans. It is used for torches, searchlights, headlights of vehicles etc."
4,Q. 5. What do you mean by lateral inversion of the image in mirrors ?,"Ans. If we look into the mirror to see the image, we see that the image is inverted sideways, i.e., if we move our left hand, the image appears to move its right hand."
5,Q. 6. What are the two factors on which the lateral displacement of an emergent ray from a glass slab depends ?,Ans. Angle of incidence and thickness of slab.
6,Q. 7. What is the magnification of the images formed by plane mirror and why ? ,Ans. Its magnification is + 1 because plane mirror always forms a laterally inverted image.  (1 mark each)
7,Q. 8. What is the range of wavelengths of the visible light ?,Ans. Wavelength of visible light = 4 × 10–7 m to 8 × 10–7 m.
8,Q. 9. What is the minimum distance between an object and its real image in case of a concave mirror ? ,Ans. Zero (0). When the object is at C.
9,Q. 10. Why are convex mirrors preferred over plane mirrors as rear view mirrors ?,Ans. The field of view of convex mirror is wider in comparison to plane mirror. The convex mirror is preferred as a rear view mirror as it enables the driver to view much larger area than with a plane mirror.
10,Q. 11. We prefer a convex as a rear view mirror in vehicles. Why ? ,Ans. Due to its wide field of view.
11,"Q. 12. When a light ray passes obliquely through the atmosphere in an upward direction, how does its path generally change ? ",Ans. Light will bend away from its normal direction. 1
12,Q. 13. What makes things visible ?,"Ans. In a lighted room, when light falls on an object, it gets either partially or completely reflected. This reflected light when received by our eyes, enables us to see things."
13,"Q. 14. Explain why a ray of light passing through the centre of curvature of a concave mirror, gets reflected along the same path. ","Ans. The ray passing through the centre of curvature is incident to the mirror along its normal so ∠i = ∠y = 0. Therefore, the ray retrace its path."
14,Q. 15. Name the mirror that can give an erect and enlarged image of an object.,"Ans. When an object is placed between the pole and the principal focus of a concave mirror, the image formed is virtual, erect and enlarged."
15,Q. 16. Why does the bottom of a tank or a pond containing water appear to be raised ?,"Ans. Light from the bottom of the pond undergoes change in path at the interface of air and water. As a result, the rays appear to come from a raised surface rather than the actual bottom surface of the pond. 1"
16,Q. 17. Does the speed of light increases or decreases in a medium in comparison to its value in vacuum ? Give an illustrative example.,"Ans. Speed of light decreases in the presence of a medium e.g., When a light ray enters in water from air, its speed decreases."
17,Q. 18. What are the values of angle of incidence i and angle of reflection r for a normal incidence ?,"Ans. Normal incidence implies, i = 0°. Hence, from the second law of reflection, r = 0°."
18,Q. 19. Find the focal length of a convex mirror whose radius of curvature is 32 cm.,"Ans. Radius of curvature, R = 32 cm 			 Radius of curvature = 2 × Focal length ( f ) R = 2f f= = 16 cm. Hence, the focal length of the given convex mirror is 16 cm."
19,Q. 20. The radius of curvature of a spherical mirror is 20 cm. What is its focal length ?,"Ans. Radius of curvature, R = 20 cm 		Radius of curvature of a spherical mirror 				= 2 × focal length (f) R = 2f f= = 10 cm. 		Hence, the focal length of the given spherical mirror is 10 cm."
