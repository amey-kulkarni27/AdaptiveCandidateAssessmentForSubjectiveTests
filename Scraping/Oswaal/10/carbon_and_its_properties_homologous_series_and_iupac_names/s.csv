What are hydrocarbons ? Give examples. ,"The compound containing the molecules of hydrogen and carbon are known as hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that are made of only hydrogen and carbon atoms. Examples— Natural Gas, Methane, Propane, Alcohol."
Why does carbon atom forms a large of compounds? ,"Carbon is an element which shows a unique property of catenation, makes it possible to form a huge number of compounds. It is the property by which it can make bonds with carbon atoms, to form long chains."
Covalent compounds generally don't conduct electricity. Why? ,"A covalent bond is formed between non-metal atoms, which combine together by sharing electrons. Covalent compounds have no free electrons and no ions so they don't conduct electricity."
Why carbon is unique in nature? ,"Due to its four valence electrons, carbon is the smallest element that is able to make covalent bonds to four different atoms in its neutral form. Because  of this, large heavily branched compounds can be made by stringing together carbon and a few other non-metallic atoms in various arrangements."
"What is a covalent bond ? What type of bond exists in  CCl4,  CaCl2 ?",The chemical bonds formed between two atoms by the sharing of electrons between them is known as a covalent bond. The sharing of electrons between the two atoms takes place in such a way that both the atoms acquire stable electronic configuration of their nearest noble gas.  CCl4 — Covalent bond  CaCl2 — Ionic bond
Why is it not easy for carbon to take part in the formation of ionic compounds ?,"In order to form ionic bond, carbon atom either has to lose four electrons to form C4+ ion or gain four electrons to form C4– ions. The loss or gain of four electrons is not easy for carbon since energy needed is very high."
 What is a functional group ?  State two properties of carbon which lead to huge number of carbon compounds we see around us. , Functional group is an atom or a group of atoms in a carbon compound that gives the molecule its characteristic physical and chemical properties. It is the site of reactivity in an organic compound. For example —  Alcohol is — OH  Carboxylic acid is — COOH.  Two properties of carbon which lead to huge number of carbon compounds we see around us are —
What are covalent compounds? How are they different from ionic compounds? List any two properties of covalent compounds. , The compounds that are formed due to sharing of electrons between two atoms/compounds having covalent bonds.  Ionic compounds are formed due to transfer of electrons from one atom to another/compounds having ionic bonds/compounds having attraction between oppositely charged ions   They are poor conductors of electricity  They have low melting and boiling point.  
"Give reason why carbon can neither form C4+ cations nor C anions, but forms covalent compounds are bad conductors of electricity and have low melting and boiling points? "," Carbon cannot form C4+ cation because removal of 4 electrons from a carbon atom would require a large amount of energy.  Carbon cannot form C anion because it would be difficult for the nucleus with 6 protons to hold on to 10 electrons.  Hence, carbon atoms share electrons forming covalent compounds  Covalent compounds do not form ions/ charged particles and therefore do not conduct electricity. ½  Inter molecular forces of attraction are weak, hence low melting and boiling points.  3"
"What is meant by isomers ? Draw the structure of two isomers of butane, C4H10. Explain why we cannot have isomers of first three members of alkane series. [Board Term II, Delhi Set-I,",Isomers are the compounds which have the same molecular formula but different structural formula. Isomers of Butane :  H— C—C— C—C —H n-butane H|  H — C—H H— C — C— C—H iso-butane We cannot have isomers of the first three members of the alkane series because of the following laws of isomers :  The parent chain should have the most number of carbon atoms.  The branching cannot be done from the first on the last atom carbon atom of the structure. 
What is Structural Isomerism? Draw isomers of Pentane . ,"Structural Isomerism, or constitutional isomerism, is a form of isomerism in which molecules with the same molecular formula have different bonding patterns and atomic organisation. n – Pentane neopentane iso – Pentane"
What is homologous series of carbon compounds ? Write the molecular formula of two consecutive members of homologous series of aldehydes. State which part of these compounds determines their  physical and  chemical properties. ,"A homologous series is a series of organic compounds which belong to the same family  and show similar chemical properties. The members of this series are called homologous and differ from each other by the number of CH2 units in the main carbon chain. Molecular formula of two consecutive members of homologous series of aldehydes is CH3-CHO and CH3-CH2-CHO. In CH3—CHO compound, —CHO part and in CH3—CH2—CHO, —CH2—CHO part will determine their physical and chemical properties. 1+1+1"
List two tests for experimentally distinguishing between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid and describe how these tests are performed.  How would you distinguish experimentally between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid ?,"sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogen carbonate. Carboxylic acids reacts with sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogen carbonate to evolve CO2 gas that turns lime water milky. Alcohol, on the other hand, do not react with sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogen carbonate.  Alcohol reacts with sodium metal to produce hydrogen gas with rapid effervescence. On the other hand, carboxylic acid does not show this type of chemical reaction with sodium metal."
"A carboxylic acid  reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a compound ‘X’. The alcohol on oxidation with alkaline KMnO4 followed by acidification gives the same carboxylic acid C2H4O2. Write the name and structure of  carboxylic acid,  alcohol and  the compound ‘X’. ", C2H4O4 : CH3–COOH - ethanoic acid  C2H5OH : ethanol  X is CH3COOC2H5 - ethyl acetate 
Why is homologous series of carbon compounds so called ? Write the chemical formula of two consecutive members of any homologous series and state the part of these compounds that determines their  physical and  chemical properties. ," All the members of a series have the same functional group, similar structure and same general formula.  ½ + ½  CH3OH, C2H5OH  The physical properties are determined by alkyl group/hydrocarbon part/part other than the functional group.  The chemical properties are determined by functional group such as –OH group, or any other example from any other homologous series. "
Write the names of the following :   CH3CH2 – C ≡ CH  CH3CH2OH  CH3COCH3., Butyne  Ethanol  Propanone
