0,Q. 4. (i) Give a chemical test to distinguish between saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon. (ii) Name the products formed when ethane burns in air. Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction showing the types of energies liberated. (iii) Why is reaction between methane and chlorine in the presence of sunlight considered a substitution reaction ? ,"Ans. (i) Pass the vapours of the given samples of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons into bromine water taken in two separate test-tubes. The one which discharges the colour of bromine water is that of unsaturated hydrocarbon and the other represents saturated hydrocarbon.  (Or any other test). (ii) On burning ethane in air, the products obtained are carbon dioxide and water, along with heat and light. 2C2H6(g) + 7O2 (g) ® 4CO2 (g) + 6 H2O (l) + Heat + Light 1 (iii) It is considered a substitution reaction because the hydrogen atoms of methane (CH4) are replaced by chlorine atoms one by one."
1,Q. 9. Explain why carbon forms compounds mainly by covalent bonds. Explain in brief two main reasons for carbon forming a large number of compounds. Why does carbon form strong bonds with most other elements ?  What are the two properties of carbon which lead to the huge number of carbon compounds we see around us ?,"Ans. (i) Carbon has 4 electrons in its outermost shell, and needs to gain or lose 4 electrons to attain noble gas configuration. (ii) Losing or gaining 4 electrons is not possible due to energy considerations; hence it shares electrons to form covalent bonds. Two reasons for large number of carbon compounds : (i) Catenation : The unique ability of carbon to form bonds with other atoms of carbon, giving rise to long chains of different types of compounds. (ii) Tetravalency : Since carbon has a valency of 4, it is capable of bonding with four other atoms of carbon or atoms of elements like oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, chlorine, etc. The reason for the formation of strong bonds by carbon is its small size which enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons strongly. 1  Detailed Answer : Since carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of bonding with four other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other monovalent elements. In order to satisfy its tetravalency carbon can form double or triple bonds also with other C-atoms or with oxygen, nitrogen etc. Reasons for carbon forming a large number of compounds are : (i) Catenation : Carbon has the unique property or ability to form bonds with other atoms of carbon, giving rise to large molecules. This property is called catenation. These compounds may have long chains of carbon, branched chains of carbon or even carbon atoms arranged in rings. (ii) Tetravalency : Carbon has four valence electrons in its valence shell so the valency of carbon is four. Due to this valency, carbon is a tetravalent element and it has the capability of satisfying its tetravalent by sharing its electrons with some monovalent elements and forming covalent bonds. (iii) Carbon exhibits catenation much more than any other element due to its smaller size which makes the C — C bonds strong while the bonds between any other element are comparatively weaker due to its large size."
2,Q. 10. Elements forming ionic compounds attain noble gas electronic configuration by either gaining or losing electrons from their valence shells. Explain giving reason why carbon cannot attain such a configuration in this manner to form its compounds. Name the type of bonds formed in ionic compounds and in the compounds formed by carbon. Also explain with reason why carbon compounds are generally poor conductors of electricity.  Elements forming ionic compounds attain noble gas configuration by either gaining or losing electrons from their outermost shells. Give reason to explain why carbon cannot attain noble gas configuration in this manner to form its compounds. Name the type of bonds formed in ionic compounds and in the compounds formed by carbon. Also give reason why carbon compounds are generally poor conductors of electricity. ,Ans. Carbon has 4 electrons in its outermost shell. It cannot lose 4 electrons to form C4+ because very high energy is required to remove 4 electrons. 1½ In cannot gain 4 electrons to form C4– ions because it is difficult for 6 protons to hold on to 10 electrons. (i) Ionic/Electrovalent Bonds. (ii) Covalent bonds. (iii) There are no charged particles in carbon compounds and hence poor conductors of electricity. 
3,Q. 11. List two reasons for carbon forming a large number of compounds. Name the type of bonding found in most of its compounds. Why does carbon form compounds mainly by this kind of bonding. Give reason why the carbon compounds : (i) Generally have low melting and boiling points. (ii) Do not conduct electricity in molten state. ,"Ans. Two of the main reasons because of which carbon forms a large number of organic compounds are : 1. Tetravalent nature of carbon 2. Greater C–C bond strength Carbon compounds are formed by covalent bonds. (i) Carbon compounds have low melting and boiling point because these compounds are bonded with covalent bond and also forces of attraction between these molecules are not very strong. (ii) Because carbon compounds are covalent in nature, they are bad conductors of electricity; they lack free electrons."
4,Q. 12. State the reason why carbon can neither form C4+ cations nor C4– anions but forms covalent compound. Also state the reason to explain why covalent compounds: (i) are bad conductors of electricity. (ii) have low melting and boiling points. ,"Ans. Atomic number of carbon is six. This means that it has four electrons in its outermost shell and it needs four more electrons to attain noble gas electronic configuration. It does not form C4+ cation, as the removal of four valence electrons will require a huge amount of energy. The cation formed will have six protons and two electrons. This makes it highly unstable. Carbon is unable to form C4– anion as its nucleus with six protons will not be able to hold ten electrons. Thus, carbon achieves noble gas electronic configuration by sharing its four electrons with other elements, i.e. it forms covalent compounds. (i) Covalent compounds are bad conductors of electricity due to lack of free electrons. (ii) Covalent compounds are formed by covalent bonds and it has been found that the intermolecular forces of attraction in covalent compounds are weak. Thus, their melting and boiling points are quite low."
