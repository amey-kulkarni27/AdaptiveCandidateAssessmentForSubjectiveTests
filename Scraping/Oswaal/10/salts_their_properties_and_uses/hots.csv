"You are provided with three test tubes A, B and C which contain distilled water, acidic solution and basic solution respectively. If you are given blue litmus paper only, how will you identify the contents of each test tube ?","Put blue litmus paper in all the three test tubes. In one test tube it will turn red that is acid. Now Put red Litmus paper in other two test tubes. The one which turn blue is base and the third one is distilled water, as it turned paper neither red nor blue."
A compound ‘P’ forms the enamel of teeth. It is the hardest substance of the body. It doesn’t dissolve in water but gets corroded when the pH is lowered below 5.5.  Identify the compound ‘P’.  How does it undergo damage due to eating of chocolate and sweets ? What should we do to prevent tooth decay ?  3," The compound ‘P’ is calcium phosphate.  It undergoes damage when the bacteria present in the mouth work on the left over food particles and produce acid. To prevent tooth decay, toothpastes  are used which neutralises the excess acid."
 You are given two solutions A and B. The pH of solution A is 6 and pH of solution B is 8.  Identify the acidic and basic solution. 		 Which solution has more H+ ion concentration ? Give reasons for your answer.  Why is HCl a stronger acid than acetic acid ? Explain.  3,"  Acidic — Solution A Basic — Solution B 		 Solution A because H+ ion concentration is higher in acidic solutions.  When same concentration of HCl and acetic acid are taken , then these produce different amounts of H+ ion . HCl gives more H+ but acetic acid gives less H+ ions . "
 Rahul has been stung by a honey bee and is in great pain. What could be the reason for this burning pain ? State the type of chemical compound that can be applied on the affected area to give relief to Rahul.  Write the name and formula of each of the following  an acidic salt 		 a basic salt 		 a neutral salt.  3,"  Bee-sting injects methanoic acid.  A mild base like baking soda will give relief. 1   Ammonium chloride, NH4Cl  Sodium carbonate, Na2CO3  Sodium chloride, NaCl. "
A substance X used as an antacid reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce a gas Y which is used in extinguishing fire.  Name the substance X and gas Y.  Write a balanced equation of the reaction between X and hydrochloric acid.  3, X – Sodium hydrogen carbonate or baking soda. Y – CO2  NaHCO3 + HCl → NaCl + H2O + CO2↑ 
" A metal compound ‘X’ reacts with dil H2SO4 to produce effervescence. The gas evolved extinguishes a burning candle. If one of the compound formed is calcium sulphate, then what is ‘X’ and the gas evolved ? Also write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction which occurred.   Name one antacid. How does it help to relieve indigestion in stomach ? 		 A farmer treats the soil with quick lime or calcium carbonate. What is the nature of soil ? Why does the farmer treat the soil with quick lime ?  5"," A → CaCO3  Gas → CO2 Equation : CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + H2O + CO2   Milk of Magnesia : It is basic in nature. Stomach produces dil. HCl. When suffering from indigestion, more acid is produced, this causes irritation. Antacid neutralises some acid and then gives relief.  Soil is acidic : Farmer wants to neutralise some acid and hence adds basic substances like CaO or CaCO3 to it. "
"A compound which is prepared from gypsum, has the property of hardening when mixed with right quantity of water :   Identify the compound and write its chemical formula.  Write the chemical equation for its preparation.  List any two uses of the above compound.", Plaster of Paris / Calcium sulphate hemihydrate CaSO4. H2O. Heat → CaSO4.
