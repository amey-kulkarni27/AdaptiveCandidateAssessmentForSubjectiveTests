Naman and Raghav performs an experiment in which they mixed concentrated sulphuric acid with water. Naman mixes water to acid and Raghav mixes acid to water slowly with constant stirring. Mention the suitable reason for selecting the one which you find is a correct method and discarding the one which is wrong. ,"The correct method is opted by Raghav i.e., mixing of conc. H2SO4 to water slowly with constant stirring. The reaction is highly exothermic and heat generated is evenly distributed in the water. In the other method opted by Raman, the heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and causes burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. "
"Ravi’s father is a Botanist. He extracted a purple dye from a plant in the laboratory which acts as an acid base indicator. When he adds this purple dye with acids, it changes to red colour. But when a small amount of base is added to this dye, it changes its colour to blue. Ravi was very excited to see that colours were changing accordingly with the solution. He observed the magic and asked some questions from his father.  What is a indicator ?  Name the plant from which his father extracted the dye.  ‘Some natural substances are good source of indicators.’ Suggest some examples to justify the statement."," Indicators are the substances which change their colour in different types of substances.  Lichen.  Examples of natural indicators :  Beetroot extract shows same colour in all sour substances and different colour in bitter substances.  Turmeric gives yellow spot on a cloth but when washed with soap, the colour of the spot changes to red."

Which information given by the teacher help him to select the baking soda as remedy ?  State any two values that you have learned from this passage. "," Pain and irritation in stomach is due to excessive secretion of a strong acid, called the hydrochloric acid.

"Farmers are using a large number of pesticides and fertilizers in their fields to increase crop production and to enhance their profits. But by doing so, they are causing damage to the soil as well as to the environment. Do you agree with this statement ? Why should we avoid eating fruits and vegetables without washing them properly ?","Plants require a specific pH range for their healthy growth. However by using a large number of pesticides and fertilizers, the pH of the soil changes which makes it more acidic or basic. So in the long run the soil becomes infertile. This also leads to the soil erosion causing damage to the environment. Hence, excessive use of these pesticides and fertilizers should be restricted as it is causing damage to the soil as well as environment. Associated Value : The learner understands the need to wash the vegetables and fruits properly before eating them."
"Acids are the substances which turn blue litmus solution red and are sour in taste. There are different types of acids like mineral acids, organic acids, dilute acids and concentrated acids. All living things are very sensitive to acids and too much acids can kill cells or stop proper working of the cells. Concentrated acids are very dangerous and should never be handled without protection.  What are organic acids ? Give two examples.  Why concentrated acids are dangerous ?  Comment on the statement — ‘‘Regular drinking of cold drinks and eating of chocolates should be avoided.’’ Give a valid reason to justify."," The acids which are obtained from plants and animals are called organic acids. Citric acid is obtained from lemon. Vinegar contains acetic acid.  Concentrated acids are very hot when they fall on any object , they burn the object.  Cold drinks, chocolates and sweets are most harmful for health as well as tooth. They produce acids in mouth which are responsible for tooth decay. It has been noticed that tooth gets dissolved in the cold drinks if kept for longtime."
Brushing our teeth twice a day is a well-known saying. Justify this statement.,We should brush our teeth twice a day as bacteria present in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food particles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent this is to clean the teeth using toothpaste which are generally basic. These can neutralize the excess acid and prevent tooth decay. Associated Value : The learner will be motivated to keep her teeth properly cleaned.
"A group of students, while on excursion trip is camping on the hills. One morning, they find themselves engulfed in a thick blanket of snow. One of the senior member of the group suggests to sprinkle common salt on the ice slit covering the pavement. Answer the following questions.  What is the purpose of sprinkling common salt on ice slit ?  Can we use any other substance in place of common salt ?  What values are associated with the passage ? 3"," When common salt is sprinkled on icy roads, ice/snow starts melting from the surface because freezing point of water is lowered. The softened ice/ snow can be easily cleared from the roads.  Calcium chloride can be used in place of common salt. It can lower the freezing point up to 55°C.  Associated values are scientific knowledge, caring, helping and supporting nature etc."
"One day a magician came in a village. He said that he can cook rice without using flame. He took an empty pot and put some rice in it. He added water to the pot and after sometime, he took the rice out. The rice were cooked. The villagers were surprised but Seema, girl of that village, was not.

How she cooked the rice without using flame ? 3"," Qualities shown by Seema are :  Good knowledge of Science  Good thinker  No blind faith on magician.  With rice, she added some lime particles. When she added water to it, an exothermic reaction occurs. The heat evolved during the reaction cooked the rice."
