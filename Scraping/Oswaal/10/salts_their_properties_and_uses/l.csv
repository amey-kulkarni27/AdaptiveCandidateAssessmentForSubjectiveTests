0,"Q. 1. Give suitable reasons for the following statements : (i) Rain water conducts electricity but distilled water does not. (ii) We feel burning sensation in the stomach when we overeat. (iii) A tarnished copper vessel regains its shine when rubbed with lemon. (iv) The crystals of washing soda change to white powder on exposure to air. (v) An aqueous solution of sodium chloride is neutral but an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate is basic. [Board Term-I Set-NS9SX1D; 2016 Set 2ZGOVVV; 2015 Set IN14KGB, 2014]","Ans. (i) Distilled water does not conduct electricity because it does not contain any ionic compound like acids, bases or salts dissolved in it. (ii) When we overeat, excess of acid is produced in the stomach which causes burning sensation. (5 marks each) (iii) Copper vessels tarnish due to formation of basic copper carbonate which gets neutralized when rubbed with lemon and the copper vessel regains its shine. (iv) Washing soda is sodium carbonate decahydrate which when exposed to air loses 10 molecules of water and changes to white powder. (v) Sodium chloride is a salt of strong acid HCl and strong base NaOH, so it is neutral. Sodium carbonate is a salt of weak acid H2CO3 and strong base NaOH, so it is basic. "
