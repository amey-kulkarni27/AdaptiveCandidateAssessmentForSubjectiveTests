Give suitable reasons for the following statements :  Rain water conducts electricity but distilled water does not.  We feel burning sensation in the stomach when we overeat.  A tarnished copper vessel regains its shine when rubbed with lemon.  The crystals of washing soda change to white powder on exposure to air.  An aqueous solution of sodium chloride is neutral but an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate is basic. ," Distilled water does not conduct electricity because it does not contain any ionic compound like acids, bases or salts dissolved in it.  When we overeat, excess of acid is produced in the stomach which causes burning sensation.   Copper vessels tarnish due to formation of basic copper carbonate which gets neutralized when rubbed with lemon and the copper vessel regains its shine.  Washing soda is sodium carbonate decahydrate which when exposed to air loses 10 molecules of water and changes to white powder.  Sodium chloride is a salt of strong acid HCl and strong base NaOH, so it is neutral. Sodium carbonate is a salt of weak acid H2CO3 and strong base NaOH, so it is basic. "
" Write the chemical formula of hydrated copper sulphate and anhydrous copper sulphate. Giving an activity to illustrate how these two are inter convertible.  Write chemical names and formulae of plaster of paris and gypsum.  ACIDS, BASES AND SALTS"," Hydrated copper sulphate – CuSO4.5H2O Anhydrous copper sulphate – CuSO4. Activity :  Heat a few crystals of copper sulphate in a dry boiling tube.  Add 2-3 drops of water on the sample of Copper sulphate obtained after heating. After heating, water is removed and salt turns white. If crystals are moisten again with water, blue colour reappears. Water of crystallization is fixed number of water molecules present in one formulae unit of a salt. Five water molecules are present in one formula unit of copper sulphate.  Calcium sulphate hemihydrate – CaSO4.½H2O Calcium sulphate dihydrate – CaSO4.2H2O. 3+2 "

Write any three uses of common  What happens when electricity is passed through salt. How is it connected to our struggle for brine ? Write the chemical equation for it. freedom ?  ,"Sodium chloride NaCl. Common salt from sea water and Rock salt. Uses of common salt :  As a raw material for making a large number of useful chemicals in industry as sodium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, hydrochloric acid.  Used in cooking food. It is essential in our food for the proper functioning of nervous systems, the movement of muscles and the production of HCl in our stomach for the digestion of food.  Used as a preservative in pickles.  Used in the manufacture of soap.  Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi March was for the procurement of common salt for common man. It is the most essential product of daily use. "
"Write the chemical name of Na2CO3.10H2O and Na2CO3. Write the significance of 10H2O. Mention the term used for water molecules attached with a salt. With the help of a chemical equation, explain the method of preparation of both Na2CO3.10H2O and Na2CO3. Also list two uses of Na2CO3.10H2O. ","Na2CO3.10H2O — Sodium carbonate decahydrate. Na2CO3 — Anhydrous sodium carbonate. 10H2O — Water of crystallization which impacts shape and colour to the crystals.

"We use colours dissolved in water during Holi and clothes gets spoiled. Many colours used to celebrate Holi are oxidized metals or industrial dyes mixed with engine oil. Doctors say these are harmful colours which should be banned for usage. Manufacturers mix dyes with colours, and sell them for their profits. Holi revellers can make their Holi colourful by using natural colours available in the market. Natural colours start fading when they come in contact with sunrays.  Why doctors say that synthetic colours are harmful ?  What are natural colours ? Sodium hydroxide Nature Neutral Ammonium hydroxide Acidic  As a student what initiative you will take to motivate your classmates to use natural colours in Holi ? Give any three suggestions."," Doctors say these colours are toxic and can cause skin allergies, eye irritation and blindness.  The colours derived from vegetables and other organic sources are known as natural colours.  Suggestions : 		 Doctor’s consultancy in the class to satisfy the classmate.
