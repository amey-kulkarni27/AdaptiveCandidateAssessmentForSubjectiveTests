(a) What is pollination ? Give its two types. (b) Draw a longitudinal section of female reproductive part of a flower showing germination of pollen grain. Label on it the following : (i) Stigma; (ii) Pollen tube with a male germ cell; (iii) Female germ cell.  (),(a) Pollination : Process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the flower Two types : Self-pollination and Cross pollination (b) Stigma Pollen tube with Male germ-cell Female germ-cell Diagram Three labellings 
Give one example each of unisexual and bisexual flowers. Differentiate between the two types of pollination that occur in flowers. What happens when a pollen lands on a suitable stigma ? Write about the events that occur till the seed formation in the ovary. ,"Unisexual Flower : Papaya/Water-melon/ any other (any one) Bisexual Flower : Hibiscus/Rose/ any other (any one) Self pollination : The pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or to the flower of the same plant Cross pollination : The pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the stigma of a flower of a different plant.  After pollen lands on a suitable stigma, a pollen tube grows out of pollen grain and travels through the style to reach the ovary  The male germ cell fuses with the female germ cell to form a zygote.  Zygote divides several times to form an embryo within the ovule  The ovule develops tough coat and gradually gets converted into a seed (Marking Scheme)"
(i) Define the terms pollination and fertilisation. (ii) Distinguish between self pollination and cross pollination.,"(i) Pollination : It is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther of a stamen to the stigma of a carpel. Fertilisation : It is defined as the fusion of a male gamete with a female gamete to form a zygote during sexual reproduction. (ii) Difference between self pollination and cross pollination : S. No. Self Pollination Cross Pollination (i) Self-pollination occurs within a flower or Cross-pollination occurs between two flowers between two flowers of the same plants. borne on different plants of the same species. (ii) Flowers do not depend on other agencies for Agents such as insects, water and wind are pollination. required for pollination. (iii) Flowers are not attractive nor do they produce Flowers attract insects by various means like nectar. coloured petals, scent and nectar."
"(a) Identify A, B, and D in the given diagram and write their names. (b) What is pollination ? Explain its significance. (c) Explain the process of fertilization in flowers. Name the parts of the flower that develop after fertilization into (i) seed, (ii) fruit. ","(a) A—Stigma B—Pollen tube C—Ovary D—Female germ cell/Egg cell (b) Pollination—Transfer of pollen grains from anther to the stigma of a flower. Significance of pollination—Process of pollination leads to fertilization as it brings the male and female gametes together for fusion. (c) After a pollen falls on a suitable stigma, the pollen tube grows out of the pollen grain and travels through the style to reach the ovule in the ovary. Here the male germ cell (carried by the pollen tube) fuses with the female germ cell to form a zygote. 		(i) Ovule 		(ii) Ovary  ½"
What is pollination ? How does it occur in plants ? How does pollination lead to fertilization ? Explain. ,"The transfer of pollens from anther to the stigma of a flower is called pollination. The transfer is accomplished by an external agency such as wind (anemophily), water (hydrophily), insects (entomophily), birds (ornithophily), bats (chiropterophily), etc. Both wind and water are abiotic agencies while insects, birds, bats etc. are biotic agencies of pollination. After falling on stigma, the pollen grain absorbs water and nutrients. It produces a tube called pollen tube. Pollen tube grows through style and reaches the ovary. Its tip contains a tube nucleus and two male gametes or sperm cells. The advancing pollen tube enters an ovule, generally through micropyle and reaches the interior of the embryo sac. Here the tube bursts to release its two male gametes. One male gamete fuses with egg to form zygote and the second male gamete fuses with binucleate central cells which forms endosperm."
