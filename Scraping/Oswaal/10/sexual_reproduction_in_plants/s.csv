questions,answers
Mention any two functions of flowers ?,Functions of a flower are :  To attract pollinators and help in pollination.  To bear male and female sex organs.
What is the significance of pollination ?," It is necessary for seed formation and thus, perpetuation of species.  It stimulates the development of fruits.  Cross-pollination brings about genetic recombination.  1 + 1"
What are the two possibilities of Selfpollination?, Self-pollination can be between the same flower.  It can take place between two different flowers of the same plant.  
"Explain giving one example of each, the unisexual and bisexual flowers. ","Unisexual is the plant whose flowers contain either stamens or carpels but not both. Example : Papaya, watermelon. Bisexual is the plant whose flowers contain both stamens and carpels. Example : Hibiscus, Mustard. "
 What is the fate of the ovules and the ovary in a flower after fertilization ?  How is the process of pollination different from fertilization ? ," After fertilization, ovules become seeds and ovary forms the fruit.  Pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from anther to the stigma of a flower. Fertilization is the fusion of male and female gametes.  ½"
Describe about the different parts of a stamen in male reproductive organ of a plant.,"Stamen is the male reproductive organ of the plant. A flower usually has a number of stamens in it. Each stamen is made up of two parts-a filament, the stalk of stamen and an anther, the swollen top of stamen. Anther is the upper bilobed part and each lobe contains two pollen sacs within which numerous pollen grains are produced.  "
What is meant by pollination ? Name and differentiate between the two types of pollination. ," Pollination : The transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma is called pollination. 1 The two types of pollination :  Self pollination : When the pollen grains from the stamens of a flower fall on the stigma of the same flower, then self pollination occurs.  Cross pollination : When pollen grains from the stamens of a flower fall on the stigma of another flower, then cross pollination occurs. "
Describe in brief the function of various parts of female reproductive part of bisexual flower. ," Sepals and petals : Sepals in the calyx cup protect the flower in the bud stage. They persist in the fruit. Petals of insect pollinated flowers are brightly coloured and scented to attract bees and butterflies for pollination. They are colourless and inconspicuous in wind pollinated flowers.  Stamen : This is the male reproductive part of the flower. The anther produces pollen grains.  Carpel : It has a swollen bottom part called ovary, a middle elongated part called style and a sticky terminal part called stigma. The ovary contains ovules which contain the female gametes - the eggs."
Name three parts of carpel and give one function each. ,The three parts of carpel are :  Ovary : It contains the ovule.  Style : It exposes the stigma for pollination.  Stigma : It is sticky and receives the pollen grains during pollination.
 Why is vegetative propagation practised for growing some types of plants ?  Name the different parts of a flower that has germ cells.  List any two agents of pollination. ," Because they produce flowers and fruit early. 1  Stamen and pistil.  Wind, water, insects. "
 What is the difference between selfpollination and cross pollination ?  What happens to the pollen which falls on a suitable stigma ? Explain. , Self-pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther of one flower to the stigma of the same flower or another flower of the same plant. 1 Cross pollination is the transfer of pollen-grain from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower growing on another plant of the same species.  The pollen grain starts germinating and forms a pollen tube. The pollen tube grows in the style till reaches the ovule through micropyle where it fertilizes with female gamete.
Enumerate the method of fertilisation as seen in a flowering plant.,"In plants, pollination is followed by fertilisation. The pollen grains deposited on the stigma form tubes called pollen tubes. One pollen tube grows through the style and reaches the ovary, where ovules are located. Inside the ovule, the pollen tube releases two male gametes into the embryo sac. The embryo sac of the ovule contains the egg. One male gamete fuses with the egg. This fusion is called Syngamy. The other male gamete fuses with the polar nuclei. This process is called the triple fusion. This mechanism of two fusions occurring in an embryo sac is called double fertilisation. After HOW DO ORGANISMS REPRODUCE ? fertilisation, ovary develops into the fruit and ovule into the seeds."
What is a seed ? How does it help in reproduction in plants ?,"A seed is the reproductive unit of a plant which can be used to grow into a new plant. It contains a body plant or embryo and food for the baby plant. The baby plant present in a seed is in the dormant or inactive state. When the seeds get suitable conditions of water, warmth, air and light, then new plants grow out of these seeds. In this way, the parent plant reproduces more plants like itself by forming seeds through flowers."
Mention the important changes in the flower. post-fertilisation,"The important post-fertilisation changes in flower are :  Sepals, petals, stigma, style and stamen degenerate.  The fertilised egg develops into embryo.  The ovary ripens into fruit.  The ovules ripens into seeds.  The integument of ovule changes into seed coat and funicle changes into stalk of the seed. "
What is sexual reproduction ? List its four Significance. ,Two major processes namely formation of gametes and fusion of gametes constitute sexual reproduction Significance– Incorporates the process of combining DNA from two different individuals during reproduction.  Increases genetic variation.  Promotes diversity in the offsprings.  Plays a role in the origin of new species.4 × ½ = 3

"Name the parts A, B and C shown in the following diagram and state one function of each.",A. Anther : It produces pollen grains. B. Style : It provides the path through which the pollen tube grows and reaches the ovary. ½ + ½ C. Ovary : It contains ovules and each ovule has an egg cell/female gamete. It develops into fruit after fertilization.  ½ + ½
"Name the parts A, B and C shown in the diagram and write their functions. ","Part A is Stigma. Function : It is the terminal part of carpel, which may be sticky and helps in receiving the pollen grains from the anther of stamen during pollination. Part B is Pollen tube. Function : The pollen tube grows out of the pollen grain through the style to reach the ovary. Part C is Female Germ Cell. Function : It is a female gametes which fuses with male gamete to form a diploid cell known as zygote. Ovary"
