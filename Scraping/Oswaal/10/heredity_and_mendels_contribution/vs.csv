Name the information source for making proteins in the cells.  ,Cellular DNA is the information source for making proteins in cells.
Give the respective scientific terms used for studying :  the mechanism by which variations are created and inherited and  the development of new type of organisms from the existing ones. , Genetics is the study of mechanism by which variations are created and inherited.  Evolution is used for studying the development of new type of organisms from the existing ones. ½+½
No two individuals are absolutely alike in population. Why ? ,No two individuals are absolutely alike in a population because variation arises due to DNA copying.
How does comparing the DNA of different species helps in evolutionary studies ?,"Comparing the DNA of different species gives a direct estimate of how much the DNA has changed during the formation of these species. Thus, it helps us to a great extent in tracing the evolutionary pathways."
How do genes control traits ?,"Genes carry information for producing proteins, which in turn control the various body characteristics."
How many pairs of chromosomes are present in human beings ? ,23 pairs.
"In a cross between a tall pea plant  and a short pea plant , what will be the characteristics shown by the F1 generation ?",All the plants would be tall plants .
"If the weight of an elephant is reduced because of starvation, the progeny elephants will not have low weight. Give reason.","This is because the decrease in weight will not cause a change in the DNA of germ cells, due to which this change cannot be inherited."
"In a cross between round yellow seeds  and wrinkled green seeds  of pea plant, what is the ratio of plants obtained in F2 generation ?",9 round yellow : 3 round green : 3 wrinkled yellow : 1 wrinkled green.
"In turtle, high incubation temperature leads to the development of female offspring. On the other hand in lizards, high incubation temperature leads to the development of male offspring. What determines the sex of the offspring in these examples ?","In these examples, the temperature at which the fertilized eggs are incubated determines whether the offspring will be a male or a female."
