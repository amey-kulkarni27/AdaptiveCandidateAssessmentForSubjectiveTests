0,Q. 1. (a) Why did Mendel choose garden pea for his experiments ? Write two reasons. (b) List two contrasting visible characters of garden pea Mendel used for his experiment. (c) Explain in brief how Mendel interpreted his results to show that the traits may be dominant or recessive. ,"Ans. (a) Reasons : 		(i) Pea plant is small and easy to grow. 		(ii) A large number of true breeding varieties of pea plant are available. (iii) Short life cycle. 		(iv) Both self and cross pollination can be made possible. (Any two reasons) 2 × ½ = 1 (b) Contrasting characters : Round / Wrinkled seeds Tall / Short plants White / purple flowers Green / yellow seeds (Or any other) (Any two) 2 × ½ (c) When Mendel crossed two pea plants with a pair of contrasting characters only one character appeared in all the members of F1 progeny, the others remain hidden. On selfing F1, the hidden characters reappeared in just 25% of the offsprings and the other 75% shared the characters expressed in F1. Mendel concluded that the character which expresses itself in F1 and in 75% of the individuals of F2 is dominating while the other is recessive .(Or same thing can be explained by using an example) "
1,"Q. 5. With the help of one example for each, distinguish between the acquired traits and the inherited traits., Why are the traits/experiences acquired during the entire lifetime of an individual not inherited in the next generation ? Explain the reason of this fact with an example. ","Ans. l Acquired traits : Traits which develop in the life time of an individual and do not pass to the progeny. Example : Learning a skill such as dance/music/loss of body parts/weight/any other example. l Inherited traits : Traits present in the gamete/germ cells which can be seen in the progeny. Example : Skin colour/eyebrows/any other example. l Reason : Traits/characteristics acquired during one’s life time do not bring any change in the DNA of the reproducing cells/germ cells. Example : Decrease in body weight of beetles due to starvation do not pass on to the next generation because there is no change in the germ, cells of beetles.   Detailed Answer : Acquired traits are the characters that are acquired by the individual during its lifetime. These traits cannot be inherited. For example, if a wrestler develops large muscles due to his training program that does not mean it will be passed on to his offspring. Inherited traits are the characters which are inherited by the offspring from the parents. These traits are expressed in the offspring and later carried on to the next generation. For example skin colour, eye colour and shape. Acquired traits occur due to changes in the lifestyles, injury, loss of body parts, disuse of some body parts. These traits/experiences occur in the somatic cells which do not evolve germ cells and genetic materials. Therefore, these traits are not transferred or inherited in the next generation. Example, low weight of a starving beetle. 5"
2,Q. 6. (i) What is meant by traits of an individual ? (ii) Explain inherited trait and acquired trait. (iii) Define speciation. List the factors which could lead to rise of a new species. ,"Ans. (i) Traits : A characteristic feature is called trait. 1 (ii) Inherited Traits are the traits which are transferred from parents to young ones. Acquired Traits are the traits which an organism acquires in life time. (iii) Formation of new species from the existing ones is called speciation. Factors which could lead to the rise of new species are : geographical isolation, genetic drift, natural selection."
3,"Q. 7. (i) Why are two letters (such as TT, Tt, Tt) used to denote the character of height ? (ii) If a purple pea plant (PP) is crossed with a white coloured pea plant (pp), will we have white flowered pea plant in the F1 generation ? Why ? (iii) Define dominant and recessive traits.","Ans. (i) This is to show that each trait is influenced by both paternal and maternal DNA. (ii) No. This is because all the F1 progeny plants show the genetic makeup Pp, which results in purple flowers. (iii) Dominant trait is a genetic trait that is expressed in a person who has only one copy of that gene. Recessive trait is a genetic trait that is expressed only when two copies of the gene are present."
4,Q. 8. (i) Explain whether traits like eye colour or height is genetically inherited. Do power to lift weights and reading french also belong to the same category ? (ii) How do variations affect the evolution of those organisms that reproduce sexually ? ,"Ans. (i) Yes, eye colour and height are genetically inherited traits, as these are expressed by genes. No, weight lifting and reading French are acquired traits. (ii) Variations in individuals during sexual reproduction gives survival advantages to them, and help them to adapt even in extreme environments.  2"
5,Q. 9. (i) Some dinosaurs had feathers but could not fly using these feathers. Why ? (ii) What are inherited and acquired traits ? (iii) What is a sex chromosome ?,"Ans. (i) The evolution of feathers in certain dinosaurs had nothing to do with flight. In them, the feathers carried out the function of providing insulation in cold weather. (ii) Inherited traits are characters that are transferred from one generation to another. Acquired traits on the other hand are developed during the life time of an individual and cannot usually be transferred to future generations. (iii) Sex chromosome is either a pair of chromosomes, usually designated X or Y, in the germ cells of most animals, that combine to determine the sex and sexlinked characteristics of an individual."
