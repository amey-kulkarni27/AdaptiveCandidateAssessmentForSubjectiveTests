questions,answers
What are characteristics ? Give an example.,"Characteristics are details of appearance of behaviour, in other words, a particular form or a particular function. Presence of four limbs in humans is an example of characteristics."
Where are the genes located ? What is the chemical nature of gene ? ,Genes are located on chromosomes in linear sequence and at fixed positions. Chemically genes are made up of nucleic acids which constitute DNA.
Why will each gamete contain only one gene set ?,The genes controlling a particular trait separate from each other during gamete formation. Hence gamete is always pure as far as contrasting characters are considered and will possess only one gene set.
Organisms showing asexual reproduction show very little variation from each other. Why ?,"In asexually reproducing organisms, there is no mixing of genes of two different individuals since only one partner is involved. There are very minor variations generated in such organisms due to small inaccuracies in DNA copying."
“The chromosome number of the sexually reproducing parents and their offspring is the same.” Justify this statement. ,"Male individual have 46 chromosomes but because the gametes are always haploid i.e., they have half () the number of chromosomes; sperms will be haploid (23 chromosomes). Female individual also contains only 23 chromosomes in egg. It is the fusion of the sperm and egg which leads to an offsprings with 46 chromosomes."
What is the difference between F1 generation and F2 generation ?,"F1 generation F2 generation F1 generation refers to the offspring resulting immediately from a cross among the first set of parents. F2 generation on the other hand, refers to the offspring resulting from a cross among the members of F1 generation."
"During crossing, why do new features which are not present in the parents appear in the offsprings ?","In crossing, if two or more traits are involved, their genes assort independently, irrespective of the combinations present in the parents. So, new combinations of genes appear in the offsprings leading to new traits."
Why cannot the experiences of an individual during its lifetime be passed on to its progeny ?,"The experiences of an individual may only affect the somatic cells, but will not change the DNA of the germ cells. Change in non-reproductive tissues cannot be passed on to the DNA of the germ cells. Therefore, the experiences of an individual during its lifetime cannot be passed on to its progeny."
Why are traits acquired during lifetime of an individual not inherited ?,Traits acquired by an organism during its lifetime are known as acquired traits. These traits are not inherited because they do not cause any change in the DNA of the organism.
How is the equal genetic contribution of male and female parents ensured in the progeny ?,"During sexual reproduction, a female gamete (egg) fuses with a male gamete (sperm) which are haploid to form zygote. Zygote is diploid and contains 23 chromosomes from mother and 23 from father. In this way, an equal genetic contribution of male and female parents is ensured in the progeny."
"If a trait A exists in 10% of a population of an asexually reproducing species and a trait B exists in 60% of the same population, which trait is likely to have arisen earlier ?","As the population of the given species reproduce asexually there would be only very minor differences generated due to small inaccuracies in DNA copying, so trait B is likely to be arisen earlier as it is present in 60% of the population. Trait A which exists in 10% of the population may have originated due to variations."
A man with blood group A marries with a woman with blood group O and their daughter has blood group O. Is this information enough to tell you which of the traits—blood group A or O is dominant ? Why or why not ?,"No, the information provided is not enough to tell whether blood group A or O is dominant. Every character is controlled by a pair of alleles. And here it is not mentioned whether the man and woman were homozygous or heterozygous for their traits."
Explain Mendel’s experiment with peas on inheritance of characters considering only one visible contrasting character. ,Mendel conducted breeding experiments with garden peas : (i) He studied (pure ) plants of a tall/short varieties. (ii) He crossed them and obtained F1 progeny. () (iii) He found that F1 progeny was all tall plants. (iv) He selfed the (hybrid) plants of F1 progeny. (v) He found that in F2 progeny there were tall as well as short plants. (vi) The three quarter plants were tall and one quarter was short . (Or any other contrasting character may be taken.)  6 × ½ = 3
How do Mendel’s experiment show that traits are inherited independently ? ,"(i) When a cross was made between a tall pea plant with round seeds and a short pea plant with wrinkled seeds, the F1 progeny plants are all tall with round seeds. This indicates that tallness and round seeds are the dominant traits. (ii) When the F1 plants are self pollinated the F2 progeny consisted of some tall plants with round seeds and some short plants with wrinkled seeds which are the parental traits. (iii) There were also some new combinations like tall plants with wrinkled seeds and short plants with round seeds. (iv) Thus it may be concluded that tall and short traits and round and wrinkled seed traits have been inherited independently. A flow chart depicting the same.

"List two differences in tabular form between dominant trait and recessive traits. What percentage / proportion of the plants in the F2 generation/progeny were round, in Mendel’s cross between round and wrinkled pea plants ? ","S. No. (i) Dominant trait Recessive trait The trait which The trait which remains appears in the F1 hidden or which does not progeny, is domi- appear in the F1 prognant. eny is the recessive trait. (ii) It appears in more It appears in less numnumbers. ber. 75% of the plants were with round seeds. 2 + 1 "
"List in tabular form, two distinguishing features between the acquired traits and the inherited traits with one example of each.  [Board Term II 2015(Delhi), 2014 (Foreign), 2013]","S. No. Acquired Traits Inherited Traits (i) These traits are the characteristics which are developed during the lifetime of an individual. These are the characteristics transmitted from parents to the offspring. (ii) Acquired traits are not passed on to the next generation. e.g., Less body weight due to starvation. Inherited traits is genetically determined characteristic that distinguishes a person. e.g., colour of hair and eye"
What is DNA copying ? State its importance. ,"DNA replication or DNA copying is the process of producing two identical replicas from one original DNA molecule during cell division. Importance of DNA Copying : (i) DNA replication needs to occur so that during cell division, new cells will also have a copy of organism’s DNA. (ii) DNA is necessary to make all the RNA and proteins needed for cells to carry out necessary reactions and cellular processes in order for them to survive."
"“A trait may be inherited, but may not be expressed.” Justify this statement with the help of a suitable example. ","Let us take the following example to justify the above statement. Mendel crossed tall pea plants with dwarf pea plants. Parents Gametes F1 TT (Tall) F2 tt (short) t Tt (Tall) t Tt t Tt Tt Mendel’s Observation F1 generation contained all tall plants. When F1 generation underwent selfing, the trait that was unexpressed in F1 (dwarf) was observed in some F2 progeny. Thus, both traits, tall and dwarf, were expressed in F2 generation in the ratio 3 : 1. The above experiment indicates that although both the traits of tallness and shortness were inherited in F1 plants, only the tallness trait was expressed. This shows that traits may not show up in an individual but are passed on to the next generation."
“It is possible that a trait is inherited but may not be expressed.” Give a suitable example to justify this statement. ,"Yes, it is possible. Example—When pure tall pea plants are crossed with pure dwarf pea plants, only tall pea plants are obtained in F1 generation. On selfing tall plants of F1, both tall and dwarf plants are obtained in F2 generation in the ratio Reappearance of the dwarf character, a recessive trait in F2 generation shows that the dwarf trait/ character was present in individuals of F1 but it did not expressed (due to the presence of tallness, a dominant trait/character). "
"How do Mendel’s experiments show that traits may be dominant or recessive ? [Board Term II, Set (2023), 2012]","When Mendel cross-pollinated a pure male tall pea plant with a pure female dwarf pea plant, he got only tall plants in the F1 generation. When F1 tall plants were self-pollinated, Mendel got both tall and dwarf plants in the F2 generation in the ratio 3 : 1. The trait of dwarfness was present in F1 generation but was not expressed and only trait of tallness was expressed. The character which gets expressed in the presence of its contrasting form is termed dominant trait. The trait which remains unexpressed in the presence of its contrasting form is termed recessive trait. "
"(i) Name the unit of inheritance. What is its functions ? (ii) How are inherited traits different from acquired traits ? Give example. [Board Term II, Set (2024) 2012]","(i) Gene. It is the carrier of genetic information from one generation to another. (ii) The traits that are obtained from parents are inherited traits. e.g., Fused and free ear lobes. The traits that develop during lifetime of an individual are acquired traits. Example : Muscular body of a wrestler. "
"Show inheritance of two characters over two generations by making a cross between round and yellow seeded plant (RRYY) with wrinkled green seeded plant. (rryy).

"(i) Define Genetics. (ii) Who is regarded as the ‘Father of Genetics’ ? Name the plant on which he performed his experiment. (iii) Why did he selected that specific plant for his experiments ? [Board Term II, Set (2024), 2012]","(i) Genetics is the branch of biology that deals with the study of heredity and variations. (ii) Gregor Johann Mendel, garden pea. (iii) Garden pea plants were easily available / they grow in one season / fertilization was easy. (Any two) ½ + ½ "
Give the basic features of the mechanism of inheritance. ,The Basic features of the mechanism of inheritance are : (i) The traits could be hidden in many generations but can reappear in any generation unchanged. (ii) Traits which remain together may get separated in the next generation. (iii) One form of a particular character is exhibited frequently than the other form of the same character.
Give reasons for the appearance of new combination of characters in the F2 progeny. ,"If pea plants with two different pairs of characteristics are bred with each other, the F1 progeny would have all tall plants with round seeds. This implies that round seed in dominant character over wrinkled seed. In F2 progeny there would be some tall plants with round seeds wrinkled seed. However, there would be some plants with mixed characters - tall plants with wrinkled seeds and short plants with wrinkled seeds. However, there would be some plants with mixed characters - tall plants with wrinkled seeds and short plants with rough seeds. This depicts that tall/dwarf trait and round/wrinkled trait are inherited independent of each other."
"In a cross between plants with purple flowers and plants with white flowers the offsprings of F1 generation all had white flowers. When the F1 generation was self-crossed, it was observed in the F2 generation that out of 100, 75 flowers were white. Make a cross and answer the following : (i) What are the genotypes of the F2 progeny ? (ii) What is the ratio of ‘White : Purple’ flowers in the F2 generation ? [Board Term II, Set (2044) 2012]","Monohybrid Cross. 		White Flowers Purple Flowers ww Ww White Flowers (i) Genotypes of F2 progeny are WW, Ww, ww (ii) Ratio between White : Purple flowers are : "
"In one of his experiments with pea plants Mendel observed that when a pure tall pea plant is crossed with a pure dwarf pea plants, in the first generation, F1 only tall plants appear. (i) What happens to the traits of the dwarf plants in this case ? (ii) When the F1 generation plants were self-fertilised, he observed that in the plants of second generation, F2 both tall plants and dwarf plants were present. Why it happened ? Explain briefly. ","(i) Parent Gamete tt t Tt F1 Gamete Tall t The dwarf traits of the plants is not expressed in the presence of the dominant tall trait. F2 Tt tt Tall Tall Dwarf Tall : Dwarf = 3 : 1 ratio (ii) In the F2 generation, both the tall and dwarf traits are present in the ratio of 3 : 1. This showed that the traits for tallness and dwarfness are present in the F1 generation, but the dwarfness, being the recessive trait does not express itself in the presence of tallness, the dominant trait. "
How did Mendel interpret his result to show that traits may be dominant or recessive ? Describe briefly. ,"Mendel conducted breeding experiments on Pea plants. (i) He selected pure bred tall and dwarf plants. (ii) He cross-pollinated these plants. (iii) In the F1 generation, he obtained only tall plants. Tallness is the dominant trait. (iv) Then, he produced F2 generation by selfing of hybrids / F1. (v) He found that 3/4th of the plants were tall and 1/4th were dwarf. (vi) The trait which remains hidden in F1 generation plants is the recessive traits. "
"In a monohybrid cross between tall pea plants (TT) and short pea plants (tt) a scientist obtained only tall pea plants (Tt) in the F1 generation. However, on selfing the F1 generation pea plants, he obtained both tall and short plants in F2 generation. On the basis of above observations with other angiosperms also, can the scientist arrive at a law ? If yes, explain the law. If not, give justification for your answer. ","Yes, the scientist may arrive at the law of dominance according to which the trait that is expressed in the F1 generation is the dominant trait, although both the dominant and recessive traits are present in the F1 generation. In the F2 generation the recessive traits is also expressed along with the dominant traits.  1 + 1 + 1"
‘Different species use different strategies to determine sex of a newborn individual. It can be environmental cues or genetically determined.’ Explain the statement by giving example for each strategy. ,"Environmental Cue : (i) In some animals, the temperature at which fertilized eggs are kept determines whether the developing animal in egg is male or female. (ii) In some animals like snail, individual can change sex. Genetical Cue : A child who inherits an X-chromosome from her father will be a girl and one who inherits a Y- chromosome from the father will be boy. "
What will happen if both the characters present in F1 generation pass together in F2 generation ?,"If both the characters present in F1 generation pass together in F2 generation, then gametes and offsprings would receive double dose of information, that will be abnormal."

A cross was made between pure breeding pea plants one with round and green seeds and the other with wrinkled and yellow seeds. (i) Write the phenotype of F1 progeny. Give reason for your answer. ,"(i) The cross was made between round, green seeds and wrinkled, yellow seeds In the given cross, two traits were taken into account, which is a dihybrid cross. Yellow colour and round shape is dominant over green colour and wrinkled shape. Parents Gametes F1 generation RRyy Round green rrYY Wrinkled yellow Ry rY RrYy Round and Yellow The above cross shows round and yellow seeds in the F1 generation. It occurs because dominant traits (round and yellow) express itself, whereas recessive traits (wrinkled and green) get suppressed."

"(i) Differentiate between dominant and recessive traits. (ii) ‘Gene control traits’ ? Explain this statement with an example. [Board Term II, Set (2015) 2012]","(i) (a) The character which gets expressed in the presence of its contrasting form is termed as dominant trait. (b) The trait which remains unexpressed in the presence of its contrasting form is called recessive trait. (ii) Consider tallness as a characteristic. Plant height depends upon particular plant hormone which in turn will depend on the efficiency of the process for making it. If the enzyme responsible for the production of this hormone is efficient, plant will be tall. If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration that makes enzyme less efficient, the amount of hormone will be less and plant will be short."
"With the help of suitable examples, explain why certain traits cannot be passed on to the next generation. What are such traits called ? ","Such traits are called acquired traits. Acquired traits are experienced by an individual during his lifetime. These traits involve changes in non- reproductive cells (somatic cells) which are not transferred to germ cells. So, these traits cannot be passed on to the next generation. For example: Learning skills like swimming, dancing, cooking, body building, etc are acquired traits and cannot be passed on to the next generation."
What are chromosomes ? Explain how in sexually reproducing organisms the number of chromosomes in the progeny is maintained. ,"Chromosomes are long thread-like structures which contain hereditary information of the individual and are thereby the carriers of genes. Male individual have 46 chromosomes but because the gametes are always haploid., i.e., they have half the number of chromosomes; sperms will be haploid (23 chromosomes). Female individual also contains 23 chromosomes in egg. It is the fusion of the sperm and egg which leads to an offspring’s with 46 chromosomes."
‘It is a matter of chance whether a couple will give birth to a male child or a female child.” Justify this statement with the help of a flow chart showing the fusion of sex chromosomes.  How sex is determined in human beings ? ,"Sex of a child is dependent on the type of the male gamete fusing with the female gamete. Human beings possess 23 pairs of chromosomes. Out of these, 22 pairs are known as autosomes, while the remaining one pair comprises sex chromosomes (XX in females and XY in males). At the time of fertilisation, the egg cell fuses with the sperm cell, resulting in the formation of the zygote. If the egg cell carrying an X chromosome fuses with the sperm carrying an X chromosome, the resulting child would be a girl. If the egg cell carrying an X chromosome fuses with the sperm carrying a Y chromosome, the resulting child would be a boy. Father Mother Daughter Daughter Son Son"
"In human beings, the statistical probability of getting either a male or a female child is 50%. Give reasons and explain with the help of a diagram. ","A child who inherits a X chromosome from his father would be a girl (XX) while a child who inherits a Y chromosome from the father would be a boy (XY). Since, the sex of the child in determined by what he/ she inherit from father, therefore the probability of getting either male or female child is 50%. Parents Father XY XX Mother Sperms Eggs Daughters X Gametes"
Explain with the help of a figure that father is responsible for the sex of a child. ,"Sex of a child depends on what happens during fertilisation. (i) If a sperm carrying X chromosomes fertilises an ovum which carries X chromosome, then the child born will be a girl. (ii) If a sperm carrying Y chromosome fertilises an ovum which carries X-chromosome, then the child born will be boy. Thus, sperm (from father) determines the sex of the child. XY Offspring Sons  3 Mother’s Ova Gametes Zygote Offsprings Female Child (Girl) Male Child (Boy)  2 + 1"
(i) Do genetic combination of mothers play a significant role in determining the sex of a new born ? (ii) Why do all the gametes formed in human females have an X chromosomes ? ,"(i) No, because mothers have a pair of X-chromosomes. All children will inherit an X chromosome from their mother regardless of whether they are boys or girls. (ii) The 23rd pair in a somatic cell of human females contains XX chromosomes. During gametogenesis, each gamete gets one X-chromosome as the 23rd chromosome. A girl child is born by the fusion of two X-chromosomes. One X chromosome from father and one X chromosome from mother. This means a female has two X-chromosomes. 1½+1½"
