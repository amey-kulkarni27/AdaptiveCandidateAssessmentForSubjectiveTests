What is meant by power of a lens ? What does its sign  indicate ? State its S.I. unit. How is this unit related to focal length of a lens ?  , Ability of lens to converge or diverge the light rays.  +ve sign → converging lens/ convex lens −ve sign → diverging lens/ concave lens    S.I. unit – dioptre 1 dioptre = 1/ focal length  
What is meant by power of a lens ? Define its SI unit.  ,The power of a lens is defined as the reciprocal of its focal length  expressed in metres. SI unit of power is dioptre. One dioptre is defined as the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre.
State two laws of refraction.  ," The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal all lie in the same plane.  The ratio of sine of angle of incidence in the first medium to the sine of angle of refraction in the second medium is a constant and is known as refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first medium."
An object is placed at a distance of 30 cm from a concave lens of focal length 15 cm. List four characteristics  of the image formed by the lens. ,The four characteristics of the image formed by the lens are :  Image will be in between lens and focus  Formed behind the lens  Smaller than object  Virtual Image
An object is placed at a distance of 15 cm from a convex lens of focal length 20 cm. List four characteristics  of the image formed by the lens. ,"Four characteristics will be virtual, magnified, erect and image is formed behind the lens."
State four characteristics of the image formed by plane mirror., Image distance = Object distance  Size of the image = Size of the object  Image is laterally inverted  Image is always virtual and erect.
What is meant by the power of a lens ? Give its SI unit. When two or more lenses are placed in contact what will be their combined power ? ,The reciprocal of the focal length of a lens is termed as power of lens. It is expressed in metres. SI unit is dioptre. The combined power will be equal to the algebraic sum of their individual powers. 
"Mention the kind of lens that can form :  Real, inverted and magnified image  Virtual, erect and magnified image  Real, inverted and diminished image  Virtual, erect and diminished image. ", Convex lens  Convex lens  Convex lens  Concave lens. 
Briefly describe an activity to find approximate focal length of a convex lens. ,The lens is placed along the path of light–either sun rays or through electric lamp. The rays converge at a point. The distance between converging point and lens is measured which gives the rough focal length of the convex lens.
"The refractive indices of glass and water with respect to air are 3/2 and 4/3 respectively. If speed of light in glass is 2 × 108 m/s, find the speed of light in water.   Refractive index of a medium =",Speed of light in air Speed of light in the medium Speed of light in air 2 × 10 8 m/s LIGHT–REFLECTION AND REFRACTION Speed of light in air = 3 × 108 m/s Speed of light in water = 3 × 10 8 m/s = 2.25 × 108 m/s  
"State the laws of refraction of light. If the speed of light in vacuum is 3 × 108 m/s, find the speed of light in a medium of absolute refractive index ","There are two laws of refraction : Refer S.A.Q. II Q.1. Given : Speed of light in vacuum = 3 × 108 m/s Refractive index of the medium = Speed of light in vacuum/Speed of light in medium 1·5 = 3 × 108/v v = 3 × 108/1·5 = 2 × 108 m/s LIGHT–REFLECTION AND REFRACTION Hence, the speed of light in the medium of refractive index 1·5 is 2 × 108 m/s"
 Define the term magnification. Write the formula for magnification of mirror explaining the symbols used in the formula., Ratio of height of the image to height of the object is magnification.
An object is placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a convex lens of focal length 8 cm. The distance of the object from the lens is 12 cm. Find the position and nature of the image.,"u = – 12 cm, f = + 8 cm, v = ? Image is real and inverted v = + 24 cm"
"If the image formed by a lens for all positions of the object placed in front of it is always virtual, erect and diminished, state the type of the lens. Draw a ray diagram in support of your answer. If the numerical value of focal length of such a lens is 20 cm, find its power in new cartesian sign conventions. ",Diverging lens / concave lens A' 2F1 F1 B' Focal length = −20 cm  Power = P 				= 1 / f = 100 /−20 cm = −5D 
"The image of an object formed by a lens is of magnification – 1. If the distance between the object and its image is 60 m, what is the focal length of the lens ? If the object is moved 20 cm towards the lens, where would the image be formed ? State reason and also draw a ray diagram in support of your answer. ","Image with magnification –1 means image is inverted and of the same size. Therefore, object is at 2F and the image is also at 2F on the other side of the lens. Therefore, distance between the object and its image is 4f = 60 cm f = 15 cm Object distance 2f = 30 cm, if the object is shifted towards the lens by 20 cm, the new object distance 				= 30 cm – 20 cm = 10 cm. A' B' 2F1 C1 F1 2F2 F1 B This distance is less than the focal length, and the image formed in this case would be virtual, erect and will form on the same side as the object. "
"An object of height 6 cm is placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a concave lens of focal length 5 cm. Use lens formula to determine the position, size and nature of the image if the distance of the object from the lens is 10 cm. ","A concave lens always forms a virtual and erect image on the same side of the object. Image distance, v = ? Focal length, f = – 5 cm Object distance u = – 10 cm f v u f v u = 3·3 cm. v = – 3·3 cm Size of the image v Size of the object u h' h h' h1 = = 1·98 cm. 		Size of the image is 1·98 cm."
