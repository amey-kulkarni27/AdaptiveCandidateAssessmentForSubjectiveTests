Write two precautions to be taken while finding the image distance using a convex lens., Use a very sharp tipped pencil to draw thin lines to represent incident and refracted rays.  The convex lens drawn should be thin and of small aperture.  LIGHT–REFLECTION AND REFRACTION
Write two precautions to be taken while tracing the path of a ray of light passing through a rectangular glass slab for different angles of incidence.," The glass slab should be perfectly rectangular with all its faces smooth.  While fixing the pins P1 and P2 or the pins P3 and P4, care should be taken to maintain a distance of about 5 cm between the two pins. This would help in tracing the direction of incident ray and that of emergent ray with greater accuracy."
Write two precautions to be taken while tracing the path of a ray of light passing through a rectangular glass prism.," While viewing the collinearity of pins and images, the eye should be kept at a distance from the pins so that all of them can be seen simultaneously. The collinearity of pins fixed on one side of the glass prism and the images of pins on the other side could also be confirmed by moving the head slightly to either side while viewing them. All the pins and images of pins would appear to move together if they are collinear.  The pins P1, P2, P3 and P4 fixed on the paper may not be exactly perpendicular  to the plane of paper. It is therefore desirable to look at the feet of the pins or their images while establishing their collinearity. That is why the position of each pin is marked with pointed tip of the pins on the paper."
A student focussed the Sun rays using an optical device ‘X’ on a screen S as shown. 40 cm What conclusion can be drawn based on this about device X?,"Light rays from infinity are converged at the focal point of the convex lens. Therefore, the focal length of the convex lens is 20 cm."
