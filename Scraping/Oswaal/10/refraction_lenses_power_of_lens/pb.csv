0,"Q. 1. A student focuses the image of a well illuminated distant object on a screen using a convex lens. After that he gradually moves the object towards the lens and each time focuses its image on the screen by adjusting the lens.  (i) In which direction-towards the screen or away from the screen, does he move the lens ? (ii) What happens to the size of the image-does it decrease or increase ? (iii) What happens to the image on the screen when he moves the object very close to the lens ?",Ans.(i) Towards the lens. answer) (ii) Size decreases gradually. (ii) Increase. (iii) Nearly 30 cm from the lens. (iii) No image on the screen.  (iv) Intensity of the image gradually increases. 4 × ½
1,"Q. 3. An object of height 2.5 cm is placed at a distance of 15 cm from the optical centre 'O' of a convex lens of focal length 10 cm. Draw a ray diagram to find the position and size of the image formed. Mark optical centre 'O', principal focus F and height of the image on the diagram. ","Ans. 2.5 cm B' 15 cm 5 cm 10 cm 30 cm A' Marking of O, F and size of the image. 2  "
2,Q. 4. Observe the following incomplete ray diagram of an object where the image A'B' is formed after refraction of a convex lens. ,Ans. (i) beyond 2F1 2F C2 B' 2 cm 20 cm 2F1 A'
3,Q. 7. A student performed an experiment with convex lens and found the virtual image of an object. Find (i) Position of the object (ii) Draw ray diagram for the above situation ,Ans. (i) Position of object is between lens and focal length of a convex lens. (ii) (ii) greater.
4,"Q. 8. A student places a 8.0 cm tall object perpendicular to the principal axis of a convex lens of focal length 20 cm. The distance of the object from the lens is 30 cm. He obtains a sharp image of the object on a screen placed on the other side of the lens. What will be the nature (inverted, erect, magnified, diminished) of the image he obtains on a screen ? Drawn a ray diagram to justify your answer.",Ans. (a) Away from the lens F2 (b) Size increases (c) Intensity decreases (d) About 20 cm
5,Q. 9. Write two precautions to be taken while finding the image distance using a convex lens.,Ans. (i) Use a very sharp tipped pencil to draw thin lines to represent incident and refracted rays. (ii) The convex lens drawn should be thin and of small aperture. (This is required for obtaining the distinct image.) LIGHT–REFLECTION AND REFRACTION
6,Q. 10. Write two precautions to be taken while tracing the path of a ray of light passing through a rectangular glass slab for different angles of incidence.,"Ans. (i) The glass slab should be perfectly rectangular with all its faces smooth. (ii) While fixing the pins P1 and P2 or the pins P3 and P4, care should be taken to maintain a distance of about 5 cm between the two pins. This would help in tracing the direction of incident ray and that of emergent ray with greater accuracy."
7,Q. 11. Write two precautions to be taken while tracing the path of a ray of light passing through a rectangular glass prism.,"Ans. (i) While viewing the collinearity of pins and images, the eye should be kept at a distance from the pins so that all of them can be seen simultaneously. The collinearity of pins fixed on one side of the glass prism and the images of pins on the other side could also be confirmed by moving the head slightly to either side while viewing them. All the pins and images of pins would appear to move together if they are collinear. (ii) The pins P1, P2, P3 and P4 fixed on the paper may not be exactly perpendicular (or vertical) to the plane of paper. It is therefore desirable to look at the feet of the pins or their images while establishing their collinearity. That is why the position of each pin is marked with pointed tip of the pins on the paper."
8,Q. 12. A student focussed the Sun rays using an optical device ‘X’ on a screen S as shown. 40 cm What conclusion can be drawn based on this about device X?,"Ans. Light rays from infinity are converged at the focal point of the convex lens. Therefore, the focal length of the convex lens is 20 cm."
