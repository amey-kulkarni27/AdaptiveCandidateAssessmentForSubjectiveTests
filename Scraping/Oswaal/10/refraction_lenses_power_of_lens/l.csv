2,"Q. 4. (a) State the laws of refraction of light. Explain the term absolute refractive index of a medium and write an expression to relate it with the speed of light in vacuum. (b) The absolute refractive indices of two media 'A' and 'B' are 2.0 and 1.5 respectively. If the speed of light in medium 'B' is 2×108 m/s, calculate the speed of light in : (i) vacuum, (ii) medium 'A' ","Ans. (a) Laws of refraction of light : (i) The incident ray, the normal and the refracted ray at the point of incidence all lies in the same plane for the two given transparent medium. (ii) The ratio of size of angle of incidence (i.e., sin i) to the sine of angle of refraction (i.e., sin r) is always constant for the light of given colour and for the given pair of media. sin i Mathematically, = constant = n2 sin r The constant 'n' is called refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first medium. Absolute refractive index of the medium is given by Speed of light in a vacuum (c ) n= Speed of light in medium (v ) (b) Given nA = 2.0 and nB = 1.5 		Speed of light in medium B = 2 × 108 m/s Speed of light in vacuum (c) nB = Speed of light in media B c 		Speed of light in vacuum c = 2 × 108 × 1.5 				= 3.0 × 108 m/s 		Speed of light in medium 'A' nA = Speed of light in vacuum Speed of light in medium 'A' Speed of light in media 'A' Speed of light in medium A = = 1.5 × 108 m/s"
3,Q. 8. (a) Explain the following terms related to spherical lenses : (i) Optical centre (ii) Centres of curvature (iii) Principal axis (iv) Aperture (v) Principal focus (vi) Focal length,"Ans. (a) (i) Optical centre : The centre point of a lens is known as its optical centre. It always lies inside the lens. A light beam passing through the optical centre emerges without any deviation. (ii) Centre of curvature : It is defined as the centre of the spheres of which the lens is originally a part of. Because the spherical lens consists of two spherical surfaces, the lens has two centres of curvature. (iv) Aperture : This is the length or breadth of the lens through which refraction takes place. (v) Principal focus : A light ray parallel to the principal axis of the lens meets at a point on the principal axis. This point is called the principal focus. (vi) Focal length : The distance of the point from the centre of lens or mirror at which a parallel ray of beam converge (or diverge) is called focal-length and the point is called focus."
4,"Q. 9. (i) Define power of a lens. Write its SI units. (ii) You are provided with two convex lenses of focal length 15 cm and 25 cm, respectively. Which of the two is of larger power ? Give reason for your answer. [Board Term II, Set (2017), 2012]",Ans. (i) Ability of a lens to converge or diverge light rays is termed as power of a lens. Power = Focal length SI unit of power is Dioptre. (ii) Lens of focal length 15 cm is of larger power because power is inversely proportional to the focal length. 
5,"Q. 10. What is meant by the power of a lens ? What is its S.I. unit ? Name the type of lens whose power is positive. The image of an object formed by a lens is real, inverted and of the same size as the object. If the image is at a distance of 40 cm from the lens, what is the nature and power of the lens ? Draw ray diagram to justify your answer.","Ans. (i) Power of lens – Ability of a lens to converge or diverge light rays / Degree of convergence or divergence of light ray achieved by a lens / Reciprocal of focal length of the lens (ii) S.I. unit is dioptre (iii) Convex lens has positive power (iv) v = +40 cm; h' = h The lens is real, inverted and same sized ∴ object is at 2F 2f = 40 ∴ f = 20 P= = = 5 dioptre ½ f 20cm"
6,"Q. 14. A student wants to project the image of a candle flame on the walls of school laboratory by using a lens : (i) Which type of lens should he use and why ? (ii) At what distance in terms of focal length ‘F’ of the lens should he place the candle flame so as to get (i) a magnified, and (ii) a diminished image respectively on the wall? ",Ans. (i) He should use a convex lens as it forms real images. (ii) He should place the candle flame between F and 2F (the focus and centre of curvature of the lens) to get the magnified image on the wall while the diminished image is obtained when the object is located at a distance greater than 2F.  1
