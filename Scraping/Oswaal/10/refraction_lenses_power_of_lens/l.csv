No. (6) The value, u = – 10 cm, indicates that the object is in between the optical centre and the focus (i.e., less than the focal length) of the lens and hence the image should be on the same side as the object.

No- 3, we can say that the radius of curvature of the lens is 30 cm because when an object is placed at the centre of curvature of a convex lens, its image is formed on the other side of the lens at the same distance from the lens. And, we know that focal length is half of the radius of curvature. Thus, the focal length of the lens is + 15 cm. (ii) S. No- 6 is not correct as the object distance is between focus and pole so for such cases the image formed is always virtual but in this case a real image is forming as the image distance is positive.
