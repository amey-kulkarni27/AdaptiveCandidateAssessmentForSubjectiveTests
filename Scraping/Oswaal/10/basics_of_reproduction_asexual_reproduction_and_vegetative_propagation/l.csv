"What is vegetative propagation ? List with brief explanation three advantages of practising this process for growing same types of plants. Select two plants from the following which are grown by this process : Banana, Wheat, Mustard, Jasmine, Gram. "," Vegetative propagation is the development of a new plant from the vegetative parts / roots, stem and leaves of a plant.  Advantages :  Such plants can bear flowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds  Allows propagation of plants  that have lost capacity to produce seeds.  All plants produced are genetically similar to the parent plant and hence have all its characters.  Jasmine, banana.  "
Name the following : An organism which reproduces by :  Binary fission  Multiple fission  Budding  Fragmentation  Spore formation, Amoeba  Plasmodium  Hydra  Spirogyra  Rhizopus.
 What are the different methods of asexual reproduction ?    Explain budding and regeneration with diagrams. ,"  Fission,  Budding,  Fragmentation,  Spore formation,  Vegetative propagation.  Regeneration : See of Q. 7 .  Topic 1. Budding : In Hydra, a bud develops as an outgrowth due to repeated cell divisions at one specific site. These buds develop into tiny individuals, when full mature they detach from the parent body and start independent existence.  Topic-I.)"
Different organisms reproduce by different methods suitable to their body designs.  Justify the above statement using examples of three different organisms which reproduce by different methods of asexual reproduction.  Differentiate between sexual and asexual modes of reproduction.  ," Amoeba : Binary fission Plasmodium : Multiple fission Hydra : Budding Planaria : Regeneration   Sexual-two parents; Asexual-single parent.  5 		Detailed Answer :   Binary Fission in Amoeba—In this method, the nucleus first divides amitotically into two, followed by the division of the cytoplasm. The cell finally splits into two daughter cells. So, from one Amoeba parent, two daughter amoebae are formed.  Budding in Hydra—In Budding, a small part of the body of the parents grows out as a ‘bud’ which then detaches and becomes a new organism. Hydra reproduces by budding using the regenerative cells. A bud develops as an outgrowth in hydra due to repeated cell division at one specific site. When fully mature, the bud detaches itself from the parent body and develops into new independent individuals.  Regeneration in Planaria—In this method, small cut or broken parts of the organisms body grow or regenerate into separate individuals. Planaria can be cut into any number of pieces and each piece grows into a complete organism.  Difference between Reproduction : No. Sexual Sexual Reproduction and Asexual Asexual Reproduction  Two parents required. are Only one parent is required.  Offsprings are Offsprings are genetically dissimilar identical to parents. from parents."
Differentiate between the following :  Pollen tube and style.  Fission in Amoeba and Plasmodium  Fragmentation and regeneration  Bud of Hydra and bud of Bryophyllum  Vegetative propagation and Spore formation ," Pollen Tube Style Pollen tube is the part of the male gametophyte in plants. It is a long tube like structure that carries the male gamete from the stigma to the ovules. It is a part of the female reproductive organ, carpel. It joins the stigma to the ovary. It is made up of soft tissues which allows the pollen tube to grow downwards towards the ovule.  Binary fission in Amoeba : A single cell divides itself into two daughter cell is known as binary fission, binary fission can also occur in particular axis. e.g., Amoeba. Multiple fission in Plasmodium : It is also a mode of asexual reproduction in which a cell divides itself into many daughter cells simultaneously. It occur in definite orientation. e.g., yeast , malarial parasites.  Regeneration is of two types, in the first type, a part of the body that gets broken off or cut is regenerated. For example, lizards cast off their tails to escape predators and then regenerate them. The other type of regeneration involve the capacity to give rise to an entire organism from a cut part. It is seen in small invertebrates such as Planaria and Hydra. Fragmentation is also a mode of asexual reproduction. It is the unintentional cutting up of the body of an organism which each grows into different organism. It is most commonly seen in some algae.  In Hydra, the cells divide rapidly at a specific site and develop as an outgrowth called a bud. These buds, while attached to the parent plant, develop into small individuals. When this individual becomes large enough, it detaches itself from the parent body to exist as an independent individual. In the Bryophyllum the leaves have small buds . These buds later converts into small and very small plants which also have roots present on them. When these buds start growing further then the leaf becomes heavy and falls on the ground. Then the buds which are present on the leaf dumps into ground and forms a plant.  Vegetative propagation : It is the ability of plants to reproduce by producing new plants from vegetative parts such as roots, stem, and leaves. Spore formation : Spore formation is the mode of asexual reproduction in some organisms like fungi in which it gives rise to a globular structure known as sporangia, which contains spores. The sporangia burst to release spores and each of these spores germinates to produce a new individual. "
 List three distinguishing features between sexual and asexual types of reproduction.  Explain why variations are observed in the offspring of sexually reproducing organisms ?  , S. No. Sexual Reproduction Asexual Reproduction It produces new I t p r o d u c e s n e w organism from two o r g a n i s m f r o m a parents. single parent. It involves sex cells It does not involve sex or gametes. cells or gametes. Offsprings are not Offsprings are identical i d e n t i c a l t o t h e to the parents. parents.  Sexual reproduction promotes diversity of characters in the offsprings. It result in new combinations of genes brought together in the gamete and this reshuffling increases genetic variation. It plays a prominent role in the origin of new species. The sexual mode of reproduction incorporates process of combining DNA from two different individuals during reproduction.
 Identify the process depicted in the picture given below : 1 Parent cell 3 Cytoplasm divides 2 Nucleus divides 4 two daughter cells  Name the organism that divides by the above process.  Compare the above process with multiple fission.  State the type of reproduction in the above process and define it.  Differentiate between fission in Amoeba and Leishmania. ,"  Binary fission—Amoeba  Binary fission : Two daughter cells. Multiple fission : Many daughter cells simultaneously  Asexual reproduction, involvement of a single parent.  In Amoeba, splitting of two cells during division can take place in any plane. In Leishmania, binary fission occurs in a definite orientation in relation to the whip like structure.  3 + 2 HOW DO ORGANISMS REPRODUCE ?"
