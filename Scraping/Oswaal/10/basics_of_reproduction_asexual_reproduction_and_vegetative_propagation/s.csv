 What is meant by vegetative propagation?  How will a plant be benefitted if it reproduces by vegetative propagation ? ," Propagation by parts such as the root, stem and leaves.  Plants raised by vegetative propagation can bear flowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds. Such method also makes possible the propagation of plants that have lost the capacity to produce seeds."
List four advantages of vegetative propagation. ," Only one parent is required for reproduction, this eliminates the need of special mechanisms.  Many plants are able to tide over unfavourable conditions.  Plants that do not produce seeds are propagated by this method.  The trait of the parent plant is preserved."
List four modes of asexual reproduction. ,Four modes of asexual reproduction are :  Binary fission  Budding  Multiple fission  Fragmentation.
Write two differences between binary fission and multiple fission in a tabular form.  How does binary fission differ from multiple fission ?,"Two differences between binary fission and multiple fission are :  S. No.  Binary Fission Multiple Fission It is the division of one cell into two similar or identical cells. It is the process, in which many individuals are formed from a single individual.  The nucleus first The nucleus of the cell divides amitotically divides repeatedly, into two, followed producing many by the division of nuclei. the cytoplasm."
What is the importance of DNA copying in reproduction ? ,"DNA is a macromolecule present in the chromosome. Genes are segments of the DNA. DNA has the information to create proteins which lead to body design of the organism. If a similar individual has to be reproduced, the DNA should replicate to make an exact copy of itself. "
 How do Leishmania and Plasmodium reproduce?  State one difference in their mode of reproduction. , Leishmania reproduces by binary fission and Plasmodium reproduce by multiple fission.  Difference between Binary and Multiple fission : S. No. Binary Fission It occurs under favourable conditions and gives rise to two individuals. Multiple Fission It occurs under both favourable and unfavourable conditions and forms several individual.

Seeds and fruits are of uniform quantity, size taste and aroma and have a good quality of variety.1 + 1"
How is the process of binary fission different in Amoeba and Leishmania ? ,Amoeba reproduces through simple binary fission. Leishmania reproduces asexually through binary fission that occurs along a definite orientation related to the whip like structure at one end of the cell.  1 + 1
Fallen leaves of ‘Bryophyllum’ on the ground produce new plants whereas the leaves of rose do not ? Explain this difference between the two plants. ,"In Bryophyllum, vegetative propagation occur through leaves where buds occur. Rose leaves do not form buds. "
What is a clone ? Why do offsprings formed by asexual reproduction exhibit remarkable similarity. ,Clone is an organism which is genetically identically with its parent organism. Cloning is an artificial method of asexual reproduction. Offsprings produced by asexual reproduction exhibit remarkable similarities as no new combination of genes takes place. The parental set of genes is distributed in the offspring.
“The chromosomal number of the sexually producing parents and their offspring is the same.” Justify this statement.  Explain how offsprings and parents of organisms reproducing sexually have same number of chromosomes ? ,"The first step in sexual reproduction is gamete formation. In this step, the number of chromosomes gets halved. Thus, each gamete receives half the number of chromosomes to that of somatic cells. During fertilisation, the fusion of male and female gametes takes place, which results in the number of chromosomes in the zygote to be equal to that of somatic cells. Thus, the chromosomal number of the sexually producing parents and their offspring is the same. Bud Tentacles"
Why does bread mould grow profusely on a moist slice of bread rather than on a dry slice of bread ? ,"Moistened bread slice offers both moisture and nutrients to the bread mould, hence it grows profusely. Dry slice of bread offers nutrients but not moisture hence hyphae fail to grow."
What is vegetative propagation ? State two advantages and two disadvantages of this method. 3,"Vegetative propagation is a mode of asexual reproduction in which new plants are formed from roots, stems, leaves and buds of the individual vegetative parts of the plants, example; eyes of potato. Advantages :  Offsprings are genetically identical and therefore useful traits can be preserved.  It is a rapid and economical method. Disadvantages :  New characters cannot be introduced.  The disease of the parent plant gets transferred to the offspring. HOW DO ORGANISMS REPRODUCE ? "
"What is vegetative propagation ? When is it used ? List two uses.,","It is an asexual method of reproduction. In this process, vegetative part of a plant body such as stem, leaves, bulbs, tubers are used for growing new plants by cutting, grafting and layering which are identical to parents. It is used to grow :  Plants that have lost the capacity to produce seeds.  Plants which are genetically similar enough to the parent plants. ½+½ Superior quality of plants can be obtained.  It is cheaper, easier and more rapid method of propagation.  "
Define reproduction. How does it help in providing stability to the population of species ?  ,Reproduction : It is a  process by which new individuals of the same species are produced by the existing organisms.  Populations of organisms live in well defined places called niches in the ecosystem using their ability to reproduce.  Reproduction involves DNA copying which is the source of information for making proteins thereby controlling body design.  These body designs allow the organism to use a particular niche for the stability of the population of a species.   variations may also lead to the stability of the species.  ½ 
What is regeneration ? Give one example of an organism that shows this process and one organism that does not. Why does regeneration not occur in the latter ? , Regeneration : Ability of organisms to give rise to new individual organisms from their body parts.  Planaria/Hydra  Amoeba/Rhizopus/Banana/Sugarcane/any other  Regeneration is carried out by specialized cells which are not present in non regenerating organisms.  1
In the context of reproduction of species state the main difference between fission and fragmentation. Also give one example of each. ,"Fission : It is the method of asexual reproduction in unicellular forms of life. In this process the parent organism splits to form two or more daughter cells. Example : Amoeba / Plasmodium / Paramecium.  1, ½ Fragmentation : It is the process found in multicellular organisms. The filament breaks up into two or more pieces upon maturation. These pieces then grow into new individuals Example : Spirogyra. Detailed Answer : Fission : It is defined as the splitting of a unicellular organism into two or more than two separate daughter cells. It is the most common and simplest method of asexual reproduction in unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and Protozoa. Generally it is of two types i.e. binary and multiple fission. In binary fission, parent organism divides into two identical daughter organism with definite orientation. In multiple fission, parent organism divides into many identical daughter organisms. The nucleus of the cell splits repeatedly to form many smaller nuclei called daughter nuclei surrounded by a little bit of cytoplasm and thin membrane around them. Fragmentation : It is a form of asexual reproduction in which multicellular organisms like filamentous algae  break up into two or more small fragments or pieces. On maturity, each of which subsequently grows to form a complete new organism."
"What happens when :  Accidently, Planaria gets cut into many pieces ?  Bryophyllum leaf falls on the wet soil ?  On maturation sporangia of Rhizopus bursts ? "," Each piece regenerates into new Planaria. 1  Bud, at its notches develop into new plants.  It releases spores which germinate into new mycelium in moist conditions. Detailed Answer :  When Planaria gets cut into many pieces, each piece regenerates into a new Planarian organism.  When Bryophyllum leaf falls on the wet soil, the buds that are produced in the notches along the leaf will develop into new plants by the process known as vegetative propagation.  When the sporangia of Rhizopus burst upon maturation, it releases spores which germinate into new mycelium in moist conditions. "
Explain the term “Regeneration” as used in relation to reproduction of organisms. Describe briefly how regeneration is carried out in multicellular organisms like Hydra. 		 ,Regeneration : It is the ability of an organism to give rise to a new organism/individual from their body parts.1 Regeneration in Hydra :  The body of Hydra by any means is cut into number of pieces.  Each piece contains specialized cells.  These cells proliferate and make large number of cells.  From this mass of cells different cells undergo changes to become various cell types and tissues which finally develops into a new organism.  ½ HOW DO ORGANISMS REPRODUCE ? 
What is multiple fission ? How does it occur in an organism ? Explain briefly. Name one organism which exhibits this type of reproduction. ,"Multiple fission : The process of reproduction in which many individuals are formed or produced from the parent cell. In this process, the nucleus divides repeatedly to produce large number of nuclei. Each nucleus gathers a bit of cytoplasm around itself, develops a membrane around each structure. Many daughter cells develop which on liberation grow into adult organism. Plasmodium exhibits this type of fission. "
 With the help of a diagram demonstrate the process of regeneration as seen in Planaria.  Which type of cells are used by such multi-cellular organisms to regenerate ? ," Planaria is a type of flatworm. It has the amazing capacity to regenerate its lost body part. When the flatworm is cut horizontally, separating the head from the tail, the tail will regenerate the lost head and the head will regenerate the lost tail. This process is known as regeneration. The diagram illustrating the process of regeneration in Planaria is given below. Regeneration of Planaria  Specialized cells or Regenerative cells. "
The process of spore formation takes place in many simple multicellular organisms which have certain reproductive parts that can be identified.  Name the organism using this process.  Name the reproductive and non-reproductive parts of such organisms. , Rhizopus.  Reproductive part-Sporangia. Non-reproductive part-Hyphae 
Describe Reproduction by spores in Rhizopus. ,"Rhizopus have sporangia which contain spores/ Diagram : ½, Labelling : ½ When sporangia bursts the spores are liberated out. They contain protective thick wall to tide over unfavourable conditions. On return of the favourable conditions, spores germinate to grow into Rhizopus.  Detailed Answer : Rhizopus reproduces by spore formation which is a type of asexual reproduction. It contains tiny blob-on-a stick like structures which are involved in reproduction. The blobs are sporangia which contain spores which are covered by thick walls that protects them until they come in contact with moist surface and can begin to grow. Spores Spore formation in Rhizopus"
What is asexual reproduction ? Write the process of budding in Hydra. ,"Asexual Reproduction : Mode of reproduction used by single organisms. A bud develops as an outgrowth due to repeated cell division of reproductive cells at one specific site. These buds develop into tiny individuals, and when fully mature, detach from the parent body as new independent individuals. Detailed Answer : Asexual Reproduction is the process of producing new organisms from a single parent without the involvement of sex cells or gametes. Budding in Hydra : Budding is the process of formation of an offspring from an outgrowth or bud of a parent. In Hydra it is usually formed in the lower half of the body. The buds separate from the parent soon after their formation or after some initial growth. A bud develops as an outgrowth due to repeated cell division at specific site which after developing into tiny individuals detach from the body of the parent to become new individuals. 1+2"
The picture given below depicts the process of asexual reproduction in Plasmodium.  Name the process depicted above and define it.  What is meant by asexual reproduction ?, Multiple Fission.

"Colonies of yeast fail to multiply in water, but  multiply in sugar, solution. Give reason why ? ","Yeast is a unicellular fungus hand fungi have saprophytic mode of nutrition. This means they cannot produce their own food but require an external source of carbon and energy. Therefore, it cannot grow in water as water does not have any carbon or energy source required for their growth, while it can grow in sugar solution, where it ferments sugar to produce energy and will have a carbon source for growth. Hence, colonies of yeast can be observed in sugar solution but cannot be observed in water."
Why is DNA copying an essential part of the process of reproduction ? What are the advantages of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction ?  Why is DNA copying an essential part of the process of reproduction ?,DNA copying is essential because it makes possible the transmission of characters from parents to the next generation. Advantages of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction-Sexual reproduction gives rise to variations; which are essential for evolution as well as survival of species under unfavourable conditions. 
Can you consider cell division as a type of reproduction in unicellular organism ? Give one reason. ,"Yes, because it results in the formation of two daughter cells, that is, it results in the production of more individuals of the organism."
What is reproduction ? Explain two advantages of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction. ,Reproduction : It is a  process by which new individuals of the same species are produced by the existing organisms. Advantages of sexual reproduction :  Leads to stability of population of species.  Results in variations useful for the survival of species over time.  1
List any two modes of asexual reproduction in animals. Under which mode of reproduction is vegetative propagation placed and why ? List two advantages of vegetative propagation. ,"The two modes of asexual reproduction in animals are :  Binary fission,  Budding. Vegetative propagation is a form of asexual reproduction. It is the ability of plants to produce new plants from the vegetative parts, such as leaves, stems and roots, under favourable conditions. Advantages of vegetative propagation :  Only one parent is required for reproduction; this eliminates the need of special mechanisms .  Many plants are able to tide over unfavourable conditions because of the presence of vegetative reproductive parts like tubers, corns and bulbs.  Plants that do not produce seeds are propagated by this method, e.g., sugarcane and potato.  Vegetative propagation is a cheaper, easier and rapid method of propagation in plants than growing plants from their seeds. For example, lilies grow very slowly and take four to seven years to develop flowers when their seeds are grown, but flowers are produced only after a year or two when grown vegetatively.  The trait  of the parent plant is preserved and the offspring are genetically identical.  2"
Write one main difference between asexual and sexual mode of reproduction. Which species is likely to have comparatively better chances of survival-the one reproducing asexually or the one reproducing sexually ? Justify your answer. , Asexual reproduction does not involve genetic fusion while sexual reproduction involves fusion of male and female gametes to form a zygote.  Species reproducing sexually have better chances of survival.  Reason-Sexual reproduction gives rise to more variations which are essential for evolution as well as survival of species under unfavourable conditions.  1 HOW DO ORGANISMS REPRODUCE ?
What is Vegetative Propagation ? List its any four advantages. ,"Vegetative Propagation : Process where plant parts–roots, stems and leaves are used to develop new plants. Four advantages :  Plants can bear flowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds  Plants that have lost the capacity to produce viable seeds can be grown.  Plants grown are genetically similar/clones of the parent plant  Economical, quick and easy method. "
Explain the process of regeneration in Planaria. How is this process different from reproduction ? ,"When Planaria is cut into many pieces, each piece grows into a complete organism; this regeneration process is carried out by specialized cell; which proliferate; develop and differentiate into various cell types and tissues. Regeneration is not same as reproduction as most of the organisms would not normally depend on being cut up to be able to reproduce.  1"
"Define the following processes of asexual reproduction :  Spore formation,  Regeneration,  Multiple fission. "," Spore formation is a common method of asexual reproduction in many lower forms of life, like bacteria, fungi etc. It occurs mostly during unfavourable conditions such as extreme heat, dryness etc. The spores are asexual reproducing bodies enclosed in a thick walled structure called sporangium. On return of favourable conditions the sporangium wall bursts and the spores are released.  Regeneration means renewal, restoration, and growth. The process of getting back a full organism from its body parts is called regeneration. Some organism like Hydra, Planaria have the capability to develop a whole new organism from its cut body parts. Regeneration of an organism occurs by the process of growth and development. Regeneration occurs in those organisms which have relatively simple body organization consisting of few specialized cells.  In multiple fission, the nucleus divides several times simultaneously or successively into a number of daughter nuclei and then the cytoplasm divides into as many cells as there are nuclei, each cell containing a nucleus. It is the common form of asexual reproduction in certain acellular organisms. "
 Name any two plants that reproduce by grafting.  List any two benefits to an organism that reproduces through spores ? ," Rose / Sugarcane, Grapes.   Many organisms can be produced at the same time.  Organisms are able to tide over unfavourable conditions."
" With the help of a diagram, show asexual reproduction in Rhizopus ?  How this method is advantageous for Rhizopus ? "," Spore formation takes place in Rhizopus. Rhizopus consists of fine thread like projection called hyphae. It has a knob like structure which is involved in reproduction called sporangia, containing spores, that develop into new Rhizopus. Spores Sporangium Sporangiophores Rhizoids  More number of spores are produced which can easily help the Rhizopus to spread. "
"How do organisms, whether reproduced asexually or sexually maintain a constant chromosome number through several generations ? Explain with the help of suitable example. "," When organisms reproduce asexually, only mitotic divisions are involved and the chromosome number remains the same.  During asexual reproduction, the DNA  or the cells involved are copied and then equally divided among the two daughter cells. Thus, chromosome number remains unchanged.½  In sexual reproduction, organisms produce gametes through a special type of division, meiosis– reductional division, in which the original number of chromosomes becomes half. These two gametes combine to form the zygote and the original number of chromosomes is restored.  In sexual reproduction specialized cells / germ cells with only half the number of chromosomes are formed. When these germ cells from two individuals combine to form a new individual, the original chromosome number is restored. ½ + ½  Example : In humans, the parents father and mother each have 46 or 23 pairs of chromosomes. In the gametes–the sperm has half the number of chromosomes i.e., 23 and the egg also has 23 chromosomes. When the sperm and the egg fuse, the zygote has 46 or 23 pairs of chromosomes. Thus, the chromosome number remains constant. "
"What is the effect of DNA copying, which is not perfectly accurate, on the reproduction process ? How does the amount of DNA remain constant though each new generation is a combination of DNA copies of two individuals ? ","Reproduction results in the production of offspring similar to parents in body design and form. The exact blue prints of body design is inherited in the offspring due to DNA replication/DNA copying. The imperfect DNA copying results in genetic variations that can be both useful or harmful for the offspring. The useful variations gets selected in nature and helps organism to survive in the changing environment while harmful variation gets eliminated. If each new generation is to be the combination of the DNA copies from two pre-existing individuals, then each new generation will end up having twice the amount of DNA that the previous generation had. In sexual reproduction, the gametes usually contain half number of chromosomes and same numbers present in the body cells. These haploid gametes when fuse produce a new cell with double number of chromosomes than the gametes and same as the body cells. In this way organisms restrict doubling of DNA and maintain the chromosome number."
 Differentiate between binary and multiple fission. Name an organism that reproduces by multiple fission.   Vegetative propagation is beneficial to plants that are propagated asexually. Give two advantages. ," In binary fission, two daughter cells are formed and in multiple fission, many daughter cells are formed simultaneously.
