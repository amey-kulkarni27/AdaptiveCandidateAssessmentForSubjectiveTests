What is meant by biological magnification ? ,Biological magnification is the process of increasing the concentration of harmful chemicals like pesticides from first trophic level to the last trophic level in a food chain.
DDT has entered food chain. Which food habit is safer-vegetarian or non-vegetarian ?,"Vegetarian habit is safer. Being closer to producers, less DDT will accumulate in our body. Bio magnification leads to higher level of DDT in higher trophic levels."

We often use the word environment. What does it mean ? ,"It is the physical, chemical and biological conditions of the region.  1"
Name two decomposers operating in our ecosystem ,Bacteria and Fungi.
Why are green plants called producers ? ,Because the green plants prepare food by photosynthesis by using solar energy. 
"In the following food chain, grass provides 4000 J of energy to the grasshopper. Grass, Grasshopper, Frogs, Snakes How much energy will be available to snakes and frogs ? ","Grass → Grasshopper → Frogs → Snakes  		   So, for snakes and frogs, 4 J and 40 J energy will be available by 10% law respectively. "
"In the following food chain, 100 J of energy is available to the lion. How much energy was available to the producer ?  Plants → Deer → Lion","Plants are producers — 10,000 J."
The first trophic level in a food chain is always a green plant. Why ?  ,Green plants are producers. The first trophic level in a food chain is a producers i.e. those organisms which produce food by photosynthesis. 
Why do producers always occupy the first ecosystem ? ,"Because a lake is a self-sustaining system.  Detailed Answer : A lake ecosystem includes biotic  plants, animals and micro-organisms, as wll as abiotic  physical and chemical interactions. 1"
Name the two abiotic components of ecosystem. ,"Temperature, rainfall, soil, minerals. ½+½ "
"Write one negative effect, on the environment, of affluent life style of few persons of a society. ",Use of excessive non-biodegradable material in packaging Excessive use of natural resources like coal and petroleum which causes pollution. Affluent lifestyle results in generation of excessive waste materials.  1 
What are the various steps in a food chain called ? ,Because producers  have the ability to trap solar energy with the help of chlorophyll.  1
"Consider a food chain of the following : fish, crab, plankton, shark. Arrange the above chain in proper order of trophic level. ","Plankton, crab, fish, shark. "
"Name the organism  belonging to fourth trophic level in the food chain comprising of : Snakes, Insects, Frogs, Plants, Hawks. ",Hawks.  1
"Consider a food chain consisting of : Wheat, Rat, Snakes, Peacock. What will happen if all the snakes are killed ? ","If all the snakes of food chain are killed, the peacocks belonging to the next level will also die. Also the population of rats in the preceding level will highly increase. "
"In a food chain of frog, grass, insect and snake assign trophic level to frog. ",Grass ¾® Insect ¾® Frog ¾® Snake Frog is 3rd trophic level.  
Mention the role of micro-organisms like bacteria and fungi. ,They break down the dead remains and waste product of organisms. 
Mention the role of decomposers in our ecosystem. ,These micro-organisms break down the complex organic substances into simple inorganic substances that go into the soil and are used once more by plants.  1
What will happen if we kill all the organisms in one trophic level ? ,"If we kill all the organisms in one trophic level, the population of organisms in previous trophic level will increase."
"Which of the following are always at the second trophic level of food chain ? Carnivores, Autotroph, Herbivores. ",Herbivores or primary consumers are at the second trophic level.  1
"Choose one consumer each that belongs to the second and third trophic levels from the organisms : Eagle, Frog, Tiger, Rabbit, Fox. ",Second trophic level — Frog Third trophic level — Rabbit. 
"In the following food chain, plants provide 500 J of energy to rats. How much energy will be available to hawks from snakes ? Plants → Rats → Snakes → Hawks So.l. Snakes = 500 × = 50 J Hawks = 50 × =5J in trains, proved to be a bad idea. Why ? ",Making Kulhads on large scales leads to the loss of top soil.
"What will be the amount of energy available to the organisms of the 2nd trophic level of a food chain, if the energy available at the first trophic level is 10, 000 joules ? ",Only 10 percent energy is available from the first trophic level to second trophic level. = 1000 joules 
Pesticides added to a field is seen in increased amount in the crop and in the birds that feed on them. What is this phenomenon called ? ,Biological magnification.
