Name the parts of the human female reproductive system where fertilisation occurs.   Explain how the embryo gets nourishment inside the mother’s body.,"  Testes 		 Testosterone 		 Functions of Testosterone 		  Formation of sperms 		  Development of secondary sexual characters  Fallopian Tubes/Oviduct  Placenta, a special disc-like tissue embedded in the mother’s uterine wall and connected to the foetus/ embryo Placenta provides a large surface area for glucose and oxygen/ nutrient to pass from the mother’s blood to the developing embryo/ foetus.  Detailed Answer :  The organ that produces sperms as well as secretes male hormone is testis. The hormone secreted by it is testosterone. Functions of testosterone are :  It stimulates sperm production.  It stimulates the development of secondary sexual characters in males.  It is involved in development, maturation and functioning of accessory sex organs like vas deferens and seminal vesicles.  Fallopian tubes  The embryo gets nourishment from the mother’s blood with the help of a special tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the uterine wall. It contains villi on the embryo’s side of the tissue. On the mother’s side are the blood spaces, which surround the villi. This provides a large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to the embryo."
 Name the human male reproductive organ that produces sperms and also secretes a hormone. Write the functions of the secreted hormone.  Name the parts of the human female reproductive system where—  Fertilisation takes place  Implantation of the fertilised egg occurs.  Explain how the embryo gets nourishment inside the mother’s body. , Testes are the oval-shaped primary reproductive organs in man. Its function is to produce sperm and male sex hormone called testosterone. Testosterone hormone initiates the development of secondary sexual characters in male   Oviduct 		 Uterus.
" Write the functions of the following in human female reproductive system : Ovary, oviduct, uterus.  How does the embryo get nourishment inside the mother’s body ? Explain in brief. "," Functions : 		 Ovary : Ovary perform dual functions of production of female gamete or ovum and the secretion of female sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone. 		 Oviduct : It carry ova or eggs from the ovary to the uterus. 		 Uterus : It is a hollow pear-shaped organ within which the embryo develops.  The embryo gets nutrition from the mother’s blood with the help of a special tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the uterine wall and transfer glucose and oxygen from the mother to the embryo. "
What is Placenta ? Describe its structure. State its functions in case of a pregnant human female.  What is Placenta ? Mention its role during pregnancy. ,"Placenta : A special tissue that helps human embryo in obtaining nutrition from mother‘s blood. Structure : This is a disc which is embedded in the uterine wall which contains villi on the embryo side of the tissue, and on the mother‘s side are blood spaces which surround the villi. Function : This provides a large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to the embryo, and the developing embryo will also generate waste substances which can be removed by transferring them into the Mother’s blood through the placenta. 1 + 1 "
"Q. 7. State in brief the functions of the following organs in the human female reproductive system: Ovary, Fallopian tube, Uterus  What is menstruation ? Why does it occur ?  Why does menstruation occur ? ","Functions : Ovary–  Production of female gamete  Production of female hormone Fallopian tube–  Site of fertilization  Transfer of female gamete from ovary. Uterus–  Implantation of zygote/ fertilise egg/embryo.  Nourishment to the developing embryo. Menstruation– It is the periodic breakdown of uterine lining and its removal along with blood and mucous in  human female.  Uterine lining is required to nourish the embryo that is formed if fertilization takes place. In absence of fertilization, the lining is not required and hence is shed in the form of menstruation. "
" Name the respective part of human female reproductive system :  that produces eggs,  where fusion of eggs and sperm takes place, and  where zygote gets implanted.  Describe in brief what happens to the zygote after it gets implanted. ","  Ovary 		 Fallopian tube 		 Uterus  The zygote formed after fertilisation in the fallopian tube is implanted in the uterus. It divides repeatedly to form a mass of cells known as embryo. This embryo gets attached to the inner layer of the uterine cavity, i.e., endometrium. It thickens every month and is supplied with blood to nourish the embryo. Soon it gets covered by rapidly dividing uterine cells. This leads to pregnancy. Within a span of some months, the embryo starts developing limbs and begins to resemble a miniature human being. When all body parts of HOW DO ORGANISMS REPRODUCE ? the embryo can be recognised, it becomes a foetus. When this foetus is fully developed, the mother gives birth to the baby."
" Write the name of the male reproductive organ that produces sperms and secrete a hormone. Name the hormone secreted and state its function.  Write the site of fertilization and the part where the zygote gets implanted in the human female.  State, in brief, how an embryo gets its nourishment inside the mother’s body. "," A testosterone is the hormone produced in the testes that stimulates the development of secondary sexual characters in males. Its important functions are :  Development, maturation and functioning of the male accessory sex organs like vas deferens and seminal vesicles.  Stimulate muscular growth, growth of facial hair, low pitch voice, etc., sperm production. All these activities are hindered in the absence of testosterone.  Fertilization takes place in ampulla region of fallopian tube and zygote gets implanted in the uterus.  Embryo is present in the womb of a mother where it is connected with the uterine wall of mother by placenta. The foetus receives oxygen, nourishment and other life supporting things from mother through this placenta."
" Draw a sectional view of human female reproductive system and label the part where  eggs develop.  fertilization take place.  fertilized egg gets implanted.  Describe, in brief, the changes the uterus undergoes.  to receive the zygote.  if zygote is not formed. "," The human female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries, a pair of oviducts, the uterus and the vagina. Fallopian tube Ovary Endometrium Myometrium Perimetrium Uterine cavity Cervix Vagina  The development of egg occurs in the ovary.  Fertilisation takes place in the fallopian tubes.  The fertilised egg gets implanted in the uterus. 1   The uterus prepares itself every month to receive a fertilized egg/zygote. The inner uterus lining  becomes thick and is supplied with blood to nourish the embryo. 1 		 If the egg is not fertilised, then the uterus lining is not required. Hence, it breaks down and gets released in the form of blood and mucous through the vagina. This process lasts for 2–8 days. This cycle occurs every month and is known as menstruation."
 Name two sexually transmitted disease.  Why prenatal sex determination is prohibited by law.  What are the different methods of contraception ?," AIDS, Syphilis.  Surgery can be used to prevent frequent or unwanted pregnancies. However,this method can be used by people for gender-selective abortion as happens in illegal female foeticides. As a result of prenatal gender determination, the child-gender ratio is declining at an alarming rate in many of our societies. Therefore,prenatal gender-determination has been prohibited by law.   Creating a mechanical barrier so that the sperms do not reach the egg. This is done with a condom which is worn around the penis or a similar device that is placed in the vagina.  Changing the hormonal balance of the body so that fertilization cannot occur. This is done with the help of oral contraceptive pills.  Contraceptive devices like loop or copper-T are placed in the uterus to prevent pregnancy.  Surgical methods like vasectomy in males and tubectomy in females."
" List two advantages of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction.  Name the type of asexual reproduction seen in :  Plasmodium,  Planaria.  How will an organism be benefitted if it reproduces through spores ?  List two contraceptive methods and state two benefits of adopting these methods. "," Sexual reproduction promotes diversity of characters in the offsprings. It results in new combination of genes.   Multiple fission,  Regeneration.  It is a simpler and faster mode of reproduction. Spores being small and light get easily dispersed through wind, water and animals.  Two contraceptive methods :  Creating mechanical barrier.  Using contraceptive pills. Two benefits of these methods are :  Protection from sexually transmitted diseases.  Sufficient gap between successive births. "
" Name a sexually transmitted disease and a method to avoid it.  Draw a neat diagram of human male reproductive system and label the parts performing the following functions :  Production of sperms,  Gland which provide fluid,  Provides low temperature for the formation of sperms.  Common passage for sperm and urine. "," Viral infection such as warts or HIV-AIDS. By using condoms during sexual intercourse.   Testis,  Prostate gland,  Scrotum,  Urethra. Seminal vesicle Ureter Bladder Prostate gland Vas deferens Penis Urethra Testis Scrotum Human Male Reproductive System "
