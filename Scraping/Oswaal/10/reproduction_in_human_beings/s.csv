Secretion of prostate gland is thick, milky and alkaline. It contains chemicals essential for motility of sperms."
What changes are observed in the uterus if fertilisation does not occur ? ,When an egg is released by ovary the walls of the uterus thickens so as to give the fertilised egg a smooth covering but as fertilisation doesn’t occur the walls come back to their original position by breaking down and thus the blood in it starts flowing out through urethra.
Explain why does menstruation occur in human females ?  ,"Every month uterus prepares itself to receive fertilized egg.

If fertilization of egg does not take place then lining is no longer needed and it gets detached and comes out through the vagina along with blood and mucus.  2"
What changes are observed in the uterus subsequent to implantation of young embryo ? ,The uterine wall thickens that is richly supplied with blood. A special tissue called placenta develops which connects embryo to the uterine wall that provides nutrients and oxygen to it.
"Mention the functions of  placenta,  fallopian tube in the human female reproductive system. ", Placenta :  Helps in the transportation atom of glucose and oxygen from the mother to the embryo.  Waste generated by the embryo is removed by transferring it to the mother’s blood.  Fallopian tube :  Egg is carried from the ovary to the uterus.  Fertilization occurs here. 
How does the embryo get nourishment inside the mother’s body ? ,"The embryo gets nourishment from the mother’s blood with the help of a special tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the uterine wall. It contains villi on the embryo’s side of the tissue. On the mother’s side are the blood spaces, which surround the villi. This provides a large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to the embryo. "

 How many eggs are produced every month by either of the ovaries in a human female ? Where does fertilization takes place in the female reproductive system ?  What happens in case the eggs released by the ovary is not fertilized ? ," One egg is produced every month by one of the ovaries. Fertilization takes place in the fallopian tubes.  In case the egg released by the ovaries is not fertilized, it lives for about one day.

Write one difference between sexual and asexual mode of reproduction. Which species is likely to have better chances of survival – the one reproducing asexually or the one reproducing sexually ? Justify your answer. ,"Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of the male and the female gamete. This fusion allows the formation of new variants by the combination of the DNA from two  different members of the species. The variations allow the individuals to adapt under varied environmental conditions for better chances of survival. However, it is not always necessary that the offspring produced due to sexual reproduction has better chances of survival. Under some circumstances, asexual reproduction is more advantageous for certain organisms. For example, some individuals who do not move from one place to another and are well settled in their environment. Also, asexual reproduction is a fast and a quick mode of reproduction which does not consume much time and energy as compared to sexual reproduction. 2"
DNA content has the tendency to double itself during sexual reproduction due to combining of the genetic materials from two parents.

Write the dual purpose served by urethra in males ?," Hair growth on face, chest, armpit and genital area / body becomes muscular / voice becomes deep and coarse / penis occasionally begins to become enlarged and erect.  Formation of sperms needs lower temperature than the normal body temperature. Hence, testis lie outside the body cavity in the scrotum.  Urethra is a common duct for the passage of both urine and semen.  "
