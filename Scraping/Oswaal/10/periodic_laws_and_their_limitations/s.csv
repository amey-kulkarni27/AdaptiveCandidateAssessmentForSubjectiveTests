0,"Q. 1. State Mendeleev’s periodic law. Write two achievements of Mendeleev’s periodic table. [Board Term II, (Set A1-2009) 2012]",Ans. Mendeleev’s Periodic Law : “Properties of elements are the periodic function of their atomic masses.” Achievements : (i) It could classify all the elements discovered at that time. (ii) It helped in discovery of new elements. (iii) It helped in correction of atomic mass of some of the elements. (Any two) 1+½+½
1,Q. 2. Write two limitations of Mendeleev’s Periodic Table. ,Ans. Two limitations of Mendeleev’s Periodic Table are : (i) Position of isotopes could not be explained. (ii) No fixed position for hydrogen.
2,"Q. 3. (i) What were the limitations of Dobereiner’s triad ? (ii) Why did Mendeleev leave some gaps in his periodic table ? [NCERT, Board Term II 2012, (Set A1-2009)]",Ans. (i) Dobereiner’s system of classification failed to arrange all the elements in the form of triads having similar chemical properties. Dobereiner could identify only three triads from the elements known at that time. (ii) Mendeleev left some gaps in his periodic table for the elements yet to be discovered. He even predicted (2 marks each) the properties of these elements by studying the properties of the neighbouring elements.
3,"Q. 4. Why He, Ne and Ar are called inert gases ? ","Ans. He, Ne and Ar are called inert gases because their outermost shell is complete and they do not lose or gain electrons in their outermost shell, hence they have zero valency."
4,Q. 5. State the modern periodic law for classification of elements. How many (a) groups and (b) periods are there in the modern periodic table ?  ,Ans.“Properties of elements are the periodic function of their atomic number.” (i) There are 18 groups. (ii) There are 7 periods in the modern periodic table.  1 + ½ + ½
5,"Q. 6. State two main properties of elements on which Mendeleev’s periodic classification was based. Why position of hydrogen is not fixed in his periodic table ? [Board Term II, (Set C-2009), 2012]","Ans. (i) Physical properties of elements are periodic function of their atomic masses. (ii) Similar formula of oxides and hydrides formed by elements of same group was selected as chemical property as basis of classification. The atomic number of hydrogen is 1 and hence it should occupy the first position in group 1 of the periodic table. But because of its chemical similarity with elements of group 1 and 17, the position of hydrogen in the periodic is not fixed."
6,Q. 7. How does the electronic configuration of an atom of an element relate to its position in the modern periodic table ? Explain with one example. ,"Ans. The position of elements depends upon number of valence electrons which depend upon electronic configuration. Those elements which have same valence electrons, occupy same group. Those elements which have one valence electron belong to group 1. Elements which have two valence electrons belong to group 2. Period number is equal to the number of shells. Example : Atomic number of sodium (Na) is 11, so electronic configuration will be 2, 8, 1. Sodium has one valence electron in valence shell so it belongs to group 1. As sodium has three shells, so it belongs to 3rd period."
7,Q. 8. Why is the position assigning to hydrogen in the periodic table considered anomalous ? ,"Ans. Electronic configuration of Hydrogen resembles that of alkali metals. Like alkali metals, hydrogen combines with halogens, oxygen and sulphur to form compounds having similar formulae. On the other hand, just like halogens, hydrogen also exists as diatomic molecules and it combines with metals and non-metals to form covalent compounds. So, no fixed position can be given to hydrogen in the Periodic Table."

15,Q. 6. Give an account of the process adopted by Mendeleev for the classification of elements. How did he arrive at “Periodic Law” ? ,"Ans. (i) When Mendeleev started his work, 63 elements were known. He studied the compounds of these elements with oxygen and hydrogen. He selected hydrogen and oxygen as they are very reactive and formed compounds with most elements. The formulae of the hydrides and oxides formed by an element were treated as one of the basic properties of an element for its classification. (ii) Elements with similar properties were arranged in a group. (iii) Mendeleev observed that elements were automatically arranged in the order of increasing atomic masses."
16,"Q. 7. How does the tendency of the elements to lose electrons change in the Modern Periodic Table in (i) a group, (ii) a period and why ? ","Ans. (i) Increases down a group. Reason : At each succeeding element down a group the number of shells increases, so the distance of the valence shell from the nucleus increases, the effective nuclear force of attraction decreases on the last shell, so it becomes easy for the atom to lose electrons. (ii) Decreases in a period from left to right. Reason : As the effective nuclear charge on the valence electron increases, the attraction between the valence electron and nucleus increases, so it becomes difficult to lose electrons.  1"

(ii) Write the formula of chlorides of Eka-silicon and Eka-aluminium, the elements predicted by Mendeleev. ",Ans.

27,Q. 18. How could the Modern Periodic Table remove various anomalies of Mendeleev’s Periodic Table?,"Ans. Modification in Mendeleev’s Periodic Table : With the adoption of atomic number as the basis of classification of elements, some of the anomalies in the Mendeleev’s Periodic Table now disappeared. These are : (i) Position of Hydrogen : The atomic number of hydrogen is 1 and hence, it should occupy the first position in group 1 of the periodic Table. But because of its chemical similarity with elements of group 1 and group 17, the position of hydrogen in the periodic table is still not confirmed. (ii) Position of Isotopes : As the isotopes of an element have the same atomic number, they should occupy the same place in the periodic table. (iii) Position of Anomalous Pairs : The position of anomalous pairs of elements i.e., pairs of elements in which the element with the higher atomic mass proceeds the element with lower atomic mass, is also decided. When these elements are arranged according to their atomic number, they occupy their right places in the periodic table."
