Write two limitations of Mendeleev’s Periodic Table. ,Two limitations of Mendeleev’s Periodic Table are :  Position of isotopes could not be explained.  No fixed position for hydrogen.
 What were the limitations of Dobereiner’s triad ?  Why did Mendeleev leave some gaps in his periodic table ? , Dobereiner’s system of classification failed to arrange all the elements in the form of triads having similar chemical properties. Dobereiner could identify only three triads from the elements known at that time.  Mendeleev left some gaps in his periodic table for the elements yet to be discovered. He even predicted  the properties of these elements by studying the properties of the neighbouring elements.
"Why He, Ne and Ar are called inert gases ? ","He, Ne and Ar are called inert gases because their outermost shell is complete and they do not lose or gain electrons in their outermost shell, hence they have zero valency."
State the modern periodic law for classification of elements. How many  groups and  periods are there in the modern periodic table ?  ,Ans.“Properties of elements are the periodic function of their atomic number.”  There are 18 groups.  There are 7 periods in the modern periodic table.  1 + ½ + ½
State two main properties of elements on which Mendeleev’s periodic classification was based. Why position of hydrogen is not fixed in his periodic table ? ," Physical properties of elements are periodic function of their atomic masses.  Similar formula of oxides and hydrides formed by elements of same group was selected as chemical property as basis of classification. The atomic number of hydrogen is 1 and hence it should occupy the first position in group 1 of the periodic table. But because of its chemical similarity with elements of group 1 and 17, the position of hydrogen in the periodic is not fixed."
How does the electronic configuration of an atom of an element relate to its position in the modern periodic table ? Explain with one example. ,"The position of elements depends upon number of valence electrons which depend upon electronic configuration. Those elements which have same valence electrons, occupy same group. Those elements which have one valence electron belong to group 1. Elements which have two valence electrons belong to group 2. Period number is equal to the number of shells. Example : Atomic number of sodium  is 11, so electronic configuration will be 2, 8, 1. Sodium has one valence electron in valence shell so it belongs to group 1. As sodium has three shells, so it belongs to 3rd period."
Why is the position assigning to hydrogen in the periodic table considered anomalous ? ,"Electronic configuration of Hydrogen resembles that of alkali metals. Like alkali metals, hydrogen combines with halogens, oxygen and sulphur to form compounds having similar formulae. On the other hand, just like halogens, hydrogen also exists as diatomic molecules and it combines with metals and non-metals to form covalent compounds. So, no fixed position can be given to hydrogen in the Periodic Table."

 Which two criteria did Mendeleev use to classify the elements in his periodic table ?  State Mendeleev’s periodic law.  Why is it not possible to give a fixed position to hydrogen in Mendeleev’s periodic table ? ,  Increasing order of atomic mass as physical properties and similarities in chemical properties of elements.  The formulae and nature of hydrides and oxides formed by elements was treated as basic chemical properties for its classification.  Mendeleev’s Periodic Law : The properties of elements are the periodic function of their atomic masses.  It is because it resembles both with alkali metals as well as halogens.

Give an account of the process adopted by Mendeleev for the classification of elements. How did he arrive at “Periodic Law” ? ," When Mendeleev started his work, 63 elements were known. He studied the compounds of these elements with oxygen and hydrogen. He selected hydrogen and oxygen as they are very reactive and formed compounds with most elements. The formulae of the hydrides and oxides formed by an element were treated as one of the basic properties of an element for its classification.  Elements with similar properties were arranged in a group.  Mendeleev observed that elements were automatically arranged in the order of increasing atomic masses."
"How does the tendency of the elements to lose electrons change in the Modern Periodic Table in  a group,  a period and why ? "," Increases down a group. Reason : At each succeeding element down a group the number of shells increases, so the distance of the valence shell from the nucleus increases, the effective nuclear force of attraction decreases on the last shell, so it becomes easy for the atom to lose electrons.  Decreases in a period from left to right. Reason : As the effective nuclear charge on the valence electron increases, the attraction between the valence electron and nucleus increases, so it becomes difficult to lose electrons.  1"
" In Mendeleev’s Periodic Table, the elements were arranged in the increasing order of atomic masses. However, cobalt with atomic mass of 58.93 a.m.u. was placed before nickel having an atomic mass of 58.71 a.m.u. Give reason for the same.  Write the formula of chlorides of Eka-silicon and Eka-aluminium, the elements predicted by Mendeleev. ", It was because elements with similar properties were grouped together and increasing order of atomic mass could not be followed.  Germanium is Eka-silicon. The formula is GeCl4. Gallium is Eka-aluminium. The formula is GaCl3.

" How does the electronic configuration of an atom relates to its position  in the modern periodic table ?   Would you place the two isotopes of chlorine, Cl – 35 and Cl – 37, in different slots because of their different atomic masses or in the same slot because their chemical properties are the same ? Justify your answer. "," In the periodic table, elements are placed according to their electronic configuration. If an element has only one shell in its electronic configuration, it is placed in the first period. If the element has two shells then it is placed in the second period, and so on. Vertical columns in the periodic table are called groups. There are eighteen groups and in a group, all the elements have same number of valence electrons.  They will be placed at the same slot as their atomic number is same, valence electron and valency are same and have same chemical properties. "

How could the Modern Periodic Table remove various anomalies of Mendeleev’s Periodic Table?,"Modification in Mendeleev’s Periodic Table : With the adoption of atomic number as the basis of classification of elements, some of the anomalies in the Mendeleev’s Periodic Table now disappeared. These are :  Position of Hydrogen : The atomic number of hydrogen is 1 and hence, it should occupy the first position in group 1 of the periodic Table. But because of its chemical similarity with elements of group 1 and group 17, the position of hydrogen in the periodic table is still not confirmed.  Position of Isotopes : As the isotopes of an element have the same atomic number, they should occupy the same place in the periodic table.  Position of Anomalous Pairs : The position of anomalous pairs of elements i.e., pairs of elements in which the element with the higher atomic mass proceeds the element with lower atomic mass, is also decided. When these elements are arranged according to their atomic number, they occupy their right places in the periodic table."
How does the electronic configuration of an atom related to its position in the modern periodic table ?," The group number of elements having up to two valence electrons is equal to the number of valence electrons.  The group number of elements having more than two valence electrons is equal to the number of valence electrons plus 10. For example : Number of Valence Electrons Group number in Periodic Table  Group number = number of elec2 tron.  Group number = number of electrons + 10.  For those elements, which do not have the same number of valence electrons but same number of shells, the number of shells is equal to the period number to which they belong in the periodic table. For example : 2nd Period : Li Be Ne"
What were the limitations of Newlands law of Octaves ?,"The limitations of Newlands Law of Octaves are :  The law was applicable to elements up to calcium  only.  It contained only 56 elements. Further it was assumed by Newlands that only 56 elements existed in nature and no more elements would be discovered in the future.  In order to fit elements into the table, Newlands adjusted two elements in the same column as fluorine, chlorine and bromine which have very different properties than these elements. Iron, which resembles cobalt and nickel in properties, has been placed differently away from these elements."
