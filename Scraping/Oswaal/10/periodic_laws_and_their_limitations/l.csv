0,"Q. 1. (i) Why do we classify elements ? (ii) What are the two criteria used in the development of Modern Periodic Table ? (iii) State the position of (a) metals, (b) non-metals and (c) metalloids in the periodic table. (iv) Would you place two isotopes of chlorine; Cl–35 and Cl–37 in different slots of the periodic table because of their different atomic masses or in the same slot because their chemical properties are same ? Justify your answer. ","Ans. (i) To study the properties of elements and to keep the elements with similar properties together. (ii) Chemical properties of elements and atomic number. (iii) Metals lies on extreme left, metalloids lie in the middle and non-metals lie on the right side. (iv) They should be placed in the same slot. Since they have same numbers of electrons.  1"
1,Q. 2. (a) Why did Mendeleev have gaps in his periodic table ? (b) State any three limitations of Mendeleev’s classification ? (c) How does electronic configurations of atoms change in a period with increase in atomic number ? ,"Ans. (a) Gaps were left for undiscovered elements in the periodic table. (b) (i) Position of hydrogen was not justified. (ii) Increasing order of atomic mass could not be maintained. (iii) Isotopes have similar chemical properties but different atomic masses, they cannot be given separate places. (c) Number of shells remains the same, number of valence electrons goes on increasing from left to right in a period till octet is complete. e.g., (5 marks each) Li Ne"
2,Q. 3. Write down five major differences between Mendeleev’s. Periodic table and Modern Periodic Table. (DDE 2017),Ans. S. No. Be Mendeleev’s Period Table Modern Periodic Table (i) Elements have been Element have been arranged in increasing arranged in increasing order of atomic masses. order of their atomic number. (ii) It consists of 8 groups. It consists of 18 groups. (iii) All the groups from I No sub-groups. to VIII are divided into two sub-groups (iv) (v) He left some gaps in the All elements are filled table for undiscovered in increasing order of elements atomic number. No gaps left in periodic table. Isotopes were placed Isotopes were placed in in different groups. same group.
3,Q. 4. (a) Which two criteria did Mendeleev use to classify the elements in his periodic Table ? (b) State Mendeleev’s Periodic Law (c) Why could no fixed position be given to hydrogen in Mendeleev’s Periodic Table ? (d) How and why does the atomic size vary as you go (i) from left to right along a period (ii) down a group ?,"Ans. (a) (i) Increasing order of atomic mass as physical property and similarities in chemical properties of elements. (ii) The formulae and nature of hydrides and oxides formed by elements was treated as basic chemical property for its classification. (b) Mendeleev’s Periodic Law : Properties of elements are the periodic functions of their atomic masses. (c) It is because it resembles both with alkali metals as well as halogens. (d) (i) Atomic size goes on decreasing from left to right because one proton and one electron is being added successively therefore, force of attraction between valence electrons and nucleus increases, therefore, atomic size decreases. (ii) The atomic size goes on increasing from top to bottom in a group because number of shells keep on increasing therefore, distance between nucleus and valence electrons increases."
