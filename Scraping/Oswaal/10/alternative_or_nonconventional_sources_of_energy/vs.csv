Name the main component of solar cell. ,"Solar cell is a device that is made up of semiconductor materials such as silicon, gallium arsenide and cadmium telluride."
Define a solar panel. ,A panel which is made up of many solar cells is known as solar panel.
Name a device which can be used for cooking so as to save fuel. ,Solar cooker.
Name the component of a solar cooker that produces a green house effect inside it. ,Glass plate/sheet that covers the box. 
Name any two elements that are used in fabricating solar cells. ,Silicon / Gallium / Silver. (Any two) 1
List two indirect ways of using Solar energy.,(i) Wind energy (ii) Biomass energy 
A black surface absorbs more heat radiations as compared to a white surface under identical conditions. List two solar devices which make use of this property in their design. ,"Each solar cell produces a voltage of 0.5 volt. Solar cooker, Solar panel."
List two forms of energy in which solar energy manifests itself in oceans. ,Tidal energy and Sea-wave energy. 
Why is a solar cooker painted black from outside ? ,A black surface absorbs more heat as compared to white or a reflecting surface. 
Mention the main purpose of using a plane mirror in solar cookers. ,Mirror in a solar cooker acts as a reflector of sunlight into the box. It increases the concentration of heat rays in the box.
Name any one material used to make a solar cell and also mention the range of voltage produced by a typical cell.,"Silicon, Germanium. (Any one) 1 (Each solar cell produces a voltage of 0.5 volt.)  ()"
Mention the purpose of blackening the interior of a solar cooker. ,Black surface absorbs more heat than a white or prevents heat loss.
"Why are black surfaces, and not the white surfaces, used for making solar cookers ?","Black surfaces absorb more heat as compared to white surfaces. Therefore, for making solar cookers, black surfaces are used."
Which country is known as ’Country of Winds’ ,Denmark.
What is a wind energy farm ? ,A number of windmills erected over a large area. 1
List two non-conventional sources of energy. ,Solar energy and Wind energy.
List any two advantages of using wind energy. ,(i) Environment friendly. (ii) Efficient source of renewable energy. (iii) No recurring expenditure. (Any two) 
What should be the minimum wind speed to maintain the required speed of the turbine in a wind energy farm ? ,15 km/h.
List any two limitations in harnessing wind energy. ,(i) Wind energy farms can be established only at those places where wind blows for the major part of the year. (ii) Establishment of wind farms requires a large area of land.
"Windmill works with the energy of the blowing wind. Then, how is the supply of electricity maintained in a windmill when there is no wind ?","In a windmill, the electricity generated is stored in a battery. This battery provides electricity when there is no wind."
"Name two constituent of biogas, one should be chief constituent. ",Methane — 75% CO2
Name the part of a biogas plant where reactions take place in the absence of oxygen. ,Digester. panels.  1
Mention two different ways of harnessing energy from ocean. ,"Tidal wave, OTEC (Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion)"
State the necessary conditions to operate an ocean thermal energy conversion plant. ,The difference in temperature of water at the surface of ocean and at deeper levels (at depth upto 2 km) should be 20°C or more.
Mention any one reason due to which most of the thermal power plants are set up near coal or oil fields. ,Because fuel is used to produce heat energy by burning.
State the transformation of energy taking place in a solar cell panel. ,Solar energy → Electrical energy.
Compare the energy produced during fission of a uranium atom with the energy produced due to combustion of a carbon atom from coal. ,The fission of an atom of uranium produced 10 million times the energy produced by the combustion of an atom of carbon from coal.
