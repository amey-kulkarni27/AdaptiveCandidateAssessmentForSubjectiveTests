How does auxin promote phototropism ? ,"Auxin - a plant hormone synthesised at the shoot tips - helps the cells to grow longer. When light is coming from one side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot. This concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the side of the shoot which is away from light. Thus the plant appears to bend towards light while growing this phenomenon is called phototropism.  Detailed Answer : Auxin is the hormone which is usually synthesised in the young tip of roots and shoots. When light is coming from one side of the plant, it diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot which stimulates the cells to grow longer, resulting in the bending of shoot towards light, thus auxin promotes phototropism."
How do auxins promote the growth of a tendril around a support ? ,"Auxins promote cell elongation and are present at the shoot tip. When the tendril comes in contact with a support, auxin stimulates faster growth of the cells on the opposite sides. Thus, the tendril coils around the support."
Why is Abscisic acid called as stress hormone ? ,Abscisic acid is called stress hormones as it induces various responses in plants against stress condition. It induces the closure of the stomata during water stress. It promotes seed dormancy and ensures seed germination during favourable conditions.
How is the movement of leaves of the sensitive plant different from the movement of a shoot towards light ? ,"Movement of leaves of the sensitive plant or Mimosa Pudica or touch–me–not is a response to touch . The movement is not dependent upon growth of the plant, while the movement of shoot of a plant towards light is growth dependent movement."
What are nastic and curvature movements ? Give one example of each. ,"Nastic Movement : They are non-directional curvature movements of turgor or growth, when the movements are determined by the structure of the responding organ irrespective of the direction of structure which is generally diffused. e.g., Drooping and folding of leaves in sensitive plant in response to shock . Curvature Movement : They are changes in orientation of some plant parts in relation to others caused by intrinsic or external stimuli, e.g., sleep movement or nyctinasty of legume leaves, bending of stem towards light."
Explain the cause of shoots of the plant bending towards light. ,"Stems are positively phototrophic and bend towards the direction of light. The movement is due to occurrence of more auxin on the darker side and lesser auxin on the illuminated side. As a result, there is more growth on the darker side which causes the stem to bend towards light."
What is the significance of tropic movements in plants ? Explain any two types of tropic movements ?   ,"Tropic movement is important due to following reasons : CONTROL AND CO-ORDINATION  They serve as protective function and helps in developing a sudden response for a change.  Helps in growth and development of plants. Seismonastic Movement : These movements are brought about by mechanical stimuli such as contact with a foreign body, fast wind and rain drops etc. These movements are seen in stigmas, stamens and leaves of many plants. Photonastic Movement : There movements are induced by fluctuations in the intensity of light. Such movements are exhibited by flowers of several plants."
What is phototropism ? Describe an activity to demonstrate phototropism.   Write an activity to show phototropism and geotropism.  What type of movement is shown by mimosa plant leaves when touched with a finger. ," Phototropism : It is the growth which responds to a light stimulus. The cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a chemical called auxin that reacts when phototropism occurs. Geotropism : Refer to 2. SAQ-II, Pg. 161 Activity to demonstrate Phototropism :   Fill a conical flask with water.  Cover the neck of the flask with a wire mesh.  Keep two or three freshly germinated bean seeds on the wire mesh.  Take a cardboard box which is open from one side.  Keep the flask in the box in such a manner that the open side of the box faces light coming from a window.  After two or three days, you will notice that the shoots bend towards light and roots away from light.  Now turn the flask so that the shoots are away from light and the roots towards light.  Leave it undisturbed in this condition for a few days.  Folding up of the leaves of mimosa plant is an example of nastic movements or seismonasty.  2 + 1"
Define positive geotropism and negative geotropism. Give one example of each. ,"The movement of plant part in response to gravity is called geotropic movement and the phenomenon involved is called geotropism. When the tip of the stem grows away from the earth’s gravitational forces, it is known as negative geotropism and when the root tips grow towards gravity, it is known as positive geotropism. Stem shows negative geotropism Roots show positive geotropism. Negatively geotropic Positively geotropic"
Design an experiment to demonstrate hydrotropism. ,"Hydrotropism can be demonstrated with any germinating seedlings, which are allowed to grow on ground. The soil around the roots is separated by a polythene partition. The left side is kept moist and the right side dry. The radicle at first grows in a downward direction and after sometime the roots bend towards the moist soil. This is due to movement of the germinating roots to water.  3"
"Give one example, of following plants :   Which is  positively phototrophic and  negatively geotropic.  Which is positively hydrotropic as well as positively geotropic ?  Which synthesises auxin ?",  Positively phototrophic — Shoot  Negatively geotropic — Shoot  root  Shoot tip 
Name and state briefly one function each of any three phyto-hormones. ," Abscisic acid : inhibits growth, wilting of leaves  Gibberellins : helps the growth of stem  Cytokinins : promotes cell division  3 Detailed Answer :  Auxin : Promotes cell elongation and division, also helps in the formation of roots and seedless fruits.     Gibberellins : These are the hormones that help in the growth of the stem and flower. Cytokinins : It promote cell division and delay ageing in leaves. It reduces apical dominance and also stimulates the leaf expansion. Abscisic acid : It is a growth-inhibitor hormone that reverses the growth-promoting effects of auxin and gibberellins. It causes dormancy of seeds, wilting of leaves, closing of stomata and loss of proteins and chlorophyll. Ethylene : It promotes transverse growth, also promotes senescence and abscission of leaves. It acts as an essential hormone for the ripening of fruits. "
How do auxins promotes the growth of a tendril around a support ? Describe in brief. ,"Auxins produced in the shoot tip move downwards in the plant. These auxins cause cell elongation in the growing tissues. In the tendrils, auxins move away from the point of contact with the supporting object. More growth occurs on the side away from the support. As a result of unequal growth on the two sides, the tendril coils around the support.  1 + 1 + 1"
Name the plant hormone that promotes growth. How do these hormones bring about phototropism in the shoots of a plant ? ,"Plant hormone that promotes growth is Auxin. 1 Light falls on one side of the plant, auxins diffuse towards shady side of the shoot. Auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on shady side. Plant appears to bend towards light. "
 State the function of plant hormones. Name a plant hormone which is essential for cell division.  Name the hormone which is involved in phototropism. Explain its role. ," Plant hormones are the chemicals secreted by the plants which helps to co-ordinate growth, development and responses to the environment : 1 Cytokinin  Auxin When growing plant detects light, auxin is synthesized at the shoot tip and helps the cell to grow longer. When light comes from other side of the plant, auxin diffuses to shady side of the shoot.  1"
"Illustrate with the help of a diagram, the effect of auxins in different parts of a plant. ",Auxis are formed in apical meristem Auxin promotes cell enlargement Auxin inhibits development of lateral bud Auxin promotes cell division Auxin are found in apical meristem  3
How do auxins help in bending of stem towards light ? Explain. ,"When growing plants detect light, a hormone called Auxin, synthesized at the shoot tip helps the cells to grow longer. When light is coming from one side of the plant, Auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot. This concentration of Auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the side of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, plant appears to bend towards light. "
