List any two disadvantages of using fossil fuels. ," Burning of coal or petroleum products lead to air pollution.  The oxides of C, N and S are released on burning fossil fuels as acidic oxides. It leads to acidic rain and affect water and soil."
Fossil fuels are classified as non-renewable sources of energy. Why ?,"Fossil fuels like coal, petroleum, natural gas, etc., if exhausted, cannot be generated rapidly as they take millions of years to form again."
Large scale use of nuclear energy becomes prohibitive due to some hazards. State any two major hazards associated with a nuclear power plant. ,Storage and disposal of spent or used fuels which decay into sub-atomic particles with harmful radiations. Nuclear waste storage and disposal result in environment contamination or accidental leakage of nuclear radiations.
"Wood takes a long time to grow, but even then it is considered a renewable source of energy. Comment.","Although wood takes a long time, approximately 20 years, to grow, it is considered a renewable source of energy because the time taken is much smaller as compared to non-renewable sources of energy like– coal, petroleum, etc which take millions of years. 2"
Why does a car parked in sunlight remains hot from inside even when there is no sunlight in the car ?,"The glass windows have the peculiar property to pass radiations which have wavelength near to the visible light or shorter wavelength. It does not allow infra-red radiations of higher wavelength. Since the sun sends infra-red radiations of lower wavelengths, these pass through the glass windows, and gets trapped inside the car in the form of heat. This heat or infra-red radiations can not pass out and thus gets trapped in the car for longer time, making it hot from inside."
"Out of the two elements A and B with mass number 2 and 235 respectively, which one is suitable for making :  a nuclear reactor  a hydrogen bomb. Name the nuclear reaction involved in each case. Write one difference between the two types of nuclear reactions. ","S. No. Renewable Energy Non-Renewable Energy  Sources that can be Sources that will get regenerated. depleted.

Explain the principle and working of a biogas plant. ,"The waste of living organisms like cow dung, various plant materials like the residue after harvesting of crops, vegetable waste and sewage etc. form biomass. During the decay of biomass, in the absence of oxygen, biogas is produced in the biogas plant. A slurry of cow dung and water is made in the mixing tank from where it is fed into the digester. In the digester tank, anaerobic micro-organisms decompose complex molecules of cowdung slurry and produce biogas.  3 Nuclear Fission Nuclear Fusion A large nucleus breaks Two smaller nuclei fuse or into two smaller nuclei join together to form own and releases a large nucleus and releases large amount of energy. amount of energy.  1"
"Draw a neat diagram of a biogas plant and label  inlet of slurry,  digester and  gas outlet. ",Slurry of cattle dung and water Mixing Slab cover tank Dome
Name the process by which nuclear energy is generated and also name one substance used for it. Give two advantages and two hazards of nuclear energy. ,"The process is nuclear fission. Substances are uranium, plutonium, thorium. ½ Advantages :  For a given amount of fuel, the amount of energy released is extraordinarily large.  Nuclear power plants can be set up at any place.½ Hazards :  Improper nuclear waste storage and disposal result in environmental contamination.  Further there is a risk of accidental leakage of nuclear radiation.

"If energy can neither be created nor destroyed, explain with an example why we should worry about our energy resources ? ","Energy used is dissipated in less usable form. The energy used is consumed and cannot be used again. Example : Burning of candle → light + heat but products cannot produce chemical energy   3 Detailed Answer : The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. But, it can only be converted from one form to another. Despite this fact, the world is facing energy crisis. The reason behind it is that energy is converted into non-usable forms. Fossil fuels like coal, petroleum etc. are the sources of energy which have accumulated in nature over a long time and cannot be replaced. We should worry about such sources because these sources of energy are getting depleted and sooner or late, will no longer be available to us."
Write two points of differences between renewable and non-renewable sources of energy. Give one example of each. ,"Renewable - Supply can be renewed, Environment friendly. Eg : wind, sun, water  Non-Renewable - Supply is limited, cause environment pollution. Eg : coal, petroleum   3 Detailed Answer : S.

Make a list of three features due to which L.P.G is considered to be a good fuel ? , Releases large amount of energy on burning  easy to store  easy to transport  does not produce smoke  environment friendly   1×3
List two ways in which animal dung can be utilized as a fuel. Out of these two which one do you think is better ? Justify your answer. ,"Two ways :  as cowdung cakes,  as biogas. Biogas is better than cowdung cakes because it has high heating capacity and are non-polluting as it burns without smoke and leaves no residue like ash. Slurry left in the biogas plant is a good manure for fields. "

 List any two criteria for selecting a good fuel.  Explain how does burning of fossil fuels cause air and soil pollution. ," Criteria for selecting a good fuel : 		 Would do a large amount of work per unit volume or mass. 		 be easily accessible. 		 be easy to store and transport.   Burning of fuels releases gases like CO2, SO2, NO2. These causes air pollution. With rain, these pollutants fall as acid rain and causes soil pollution.  1"
Biomass is the material contained in the bodies of plants and animals. It includes the waste from trees and grass crops forestry agricultural and urban wastes. The excreta of living organisms and their bodies after death also contributes biomass.  Comment on the statement ‘‘Biomass is a fuel”. Justify the statement by giving two reasons.  What is Bagasse ?,Ans. Reasons :  It is a traditional source of energy which is used in domestic as well as industrial area.
