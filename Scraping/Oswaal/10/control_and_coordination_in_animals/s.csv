What is the cause of diabetes ? How it can be controlled ? ,"The pancreas, an organ that lies near the stomach, makes a hormone called insulin to help glucose get into the cells of our bodies. When you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use its own insulin as it should. This causes sugars to build up in the blood. It can be controlled by taking insulin."
How does our body maintain blood sugar level ? ,"Timing and amount of hormone released are regulated by feed back mechanisms. If sugar level in blood rises, cells of pancreas detect and secrete more insulin which leads to the fall off sugar level."
The hormones of pancreas are antagonistic in nature. How ?,"The hormones of pancreas function in opposite manner. Pancreas releases two hormones, i.e.  Insulin  Glucagon Insulin lowers the blood glucose level, while glucagon increases the blood glucose level. Hence, they are antagonistic."

Explain the feed back mechanism to regulate the action of the hormones with the help of one suitable example. ,"Hormones should be secreted in precise quantities. The timing and amount of hormone released are regulated by feedback mechanism. For example, if the sugar level in blood rises, they are detected by the cells of the pancreas which respond by producing more insulin. As the blood sugar level, falls, insulin secretion is reduced.  3 CONTROL AND CO-ORDINATION"
Which hormone is known as emergency hormone in our body ? How it helps in coping during emergency. ,Adrenaline is a hormone made by the adrenal medulla. It plays a vital role in helping our body deal with emergencies. Adrenaline is also known as epinephrine. It initiates quick action which makes the individual to think and respond quickly to the stress. The hormone increases metabolic rate. There occurs dilation of blood vessels going to heart and brain. The blood vessels reaching skin and kidneys constrict in order to provide more blood to the heart and the brain. It also increase fat metabolism thereby synthesising more energy.

"Name the hormone which regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism in our body. Which gland secretes this hormone ? Why is it important for us to have iodised salt in our diet ? ","The hormone which regulates carbohydrates, protein and fat metabolism in our body is thyroxine. Thyroxine hormone is secreted by thyroid gland. Iodised salt in diet is important because it contains iodine, which is essential for the synthesis of thyroxine hormone by the thyroid gland. In case, iodine is deficient in our diet, there is a possibility of suffering from goitre."

Name the hormone that is secreted by our  body to deal with scary situations. List any two responses shown by our body when this hormone is secreted into the blood. ,"Adrenaline. Two responses :  It acts on heart due to which heart beats faster, resulting in the supply of more oxygen to our muscles.  The breathing rate increases because of the contractions of the diaphragm and the rib muscles.  The blood to the digestive system and skin is reduced due to the contraction of muscles around small arteries in these organs.   2   "
"For a receiving tennis player, what is the path from the stimulus to the response ? ","Eye receive stimulus, i.e., vision of ball. Receptor receives stimulus and stimulates nerve endings. Impulses are produced. Impulses travel along receptor neuron to the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, they are transmitted via synapse to relay neurons. Through another synapse impulses are transmitted from relay to effector neuron. Effector neuron receive decision from brain. Effector neuron moves to effector i.e., arm. The bicep/tricep muscles arrange themselves for the response."
