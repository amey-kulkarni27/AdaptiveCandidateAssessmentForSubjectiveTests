"This is an experimental set up, where pot number (a) is kept as control. When we drop the pot horizontally what will we observe if the experiment is done to detect the response of plant towards gravity ? (a) (b)","We will observe figure number (b). This figure depicts the correct response of plant towards gravity. The response of plants towards gravity is known as geotropism. Roots responds by moving towards the centre of gravity, while shoots move in the opposite direction of gravity."
"In plants, nervous system is absent. How do plants control and co-ordinate different activities ?","In plants, the control and co-ordination is entirely chemical. Plants coordinate their behaviour against environmental changes with the help of Hormones. Plants have various hormones that help them to coordinate growth and response to environment. These are the chemical compounds which are released by stimulated cells. Hormones are diffused around the cell. Different hormones in plants are Auxins, Gribberllins, Cutokinins and abscissic acid."
Name the property that causes tendril to circle around the object. Explain how it happens and how is plant benefitted by it.  3,"Sensitivity to touch : When tendril of a plant comes in contact with any object, the part of the tendril in contact with the object does not grow as rapidly as that part which is away from the object. This causes the tendril to circle around the object. The plant gets the support of the object for growing upward without falling. "
If accidentally we step on something sharp at once we move our foot away. What is this type of response known as ? State how it is controlled. 3,Response ¾® Reflex action. (i) A receptor to perceive the stimulus. (ii) A sensory or afferent nerve which carries the message from receptor to spinal cord. (iii) The neurons of spinal cord transmit the impulse from afferent neurons to efferent neurons. (iv) Motor nerve carries message from spinal cord to the muscles that show response.
