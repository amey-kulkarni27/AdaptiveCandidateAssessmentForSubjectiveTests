 Define receptor and state their location in our body. Mention any two receptors present in our forebrain and their functions  How do nerve impulses travel in our body ? ," Specialised tips of some nerve cells which receive information from the surroundings. Location - Sense organs Gustatory receptor - detect taste Olfactory receptor - detect smell  The information acquired at the end of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell, sets off a chemical reaction that creates an electrical impulse, which travels to the cell body, then along the axon to its end, releases some chemicals, across the synapses.  1 + 1 + 1 + 2"
 Draw the structure of a neuron and label the following on it :  Dendrite  Cell body  Nucleus  Axon  Name the parts of a neuron :  where information is acquired  through which information travels as an electrical impulse Chemical Control   where this impulse must be converted into a chemical signal for onward transmission  Define neuromuscular junction.  , Refer to below figure. Cell body  Dendrite Axon Nucleus Nerve ending   Dendrite  Axon  nerve ending.  Neuromuscular junction is a chemical Synapse formed by the contact between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber.  2+3
 Define reflex arc. Draw a flowchart showing the sequence of events which occur during sneezing.  List four plant hormones. Write one function of each. , The pathway taken by nerve impulses in a reflex action is called the reflex arc : CONTROL AND CO-ORDINATION Response Motor nerves Effector Pupil shrinks Circular muscles in iris of eye Brain Stimulus Bright light Receptor Eye Sensory nerves A reflex arc showing cerebral reflex action  Auxin : It promotes elongation and division of cell and root formation. Gibberellins : They help in growth of stem. Cytokinins : They promote cell division and delay leaf ageing. Abscisic acid : It prevents wilting of leaves.
 Define reflex action. State its significance.  How do plants respond to external stimuli ? ," Reflex action : It is defined as an unconscious, automatic and involuntary response of effectors, i.e. muscles and glands, to a stimulus, which is monitored through the spinal cord. Significance : It protect us from any sudden stimulus which may harm us.  Plants produce hormones and respond to external stimuli, by growing towards sources of water and light, which they need to survive. A tropism is a growth in response to a stimulus and an auxin is a plant hormone produced in the stem tips and roots, which controls the direction of growth."
 Write names of hormones secreted by pituitary gland and adrenal gland. State their functions in the body.  Explain feedback mechanism for regulation of hormonal secretion with the help of one example. ," Pituitary gland secretes growth hormone. It regulates growth and development of the body. Adrenal gland secretes adrenaline hormone. It creates stress in our body.  The timing and amount of hormones released by various glands is controlled by feedback mechanism which is in built in our body, e.g, if sugar level in blood rises too high, it is detected by cells of pancreas which respond by producing and secreting more insulin into blood. As blood sugar falls to certain level, the secretion of insulin is reduced automatically."
What constitutes the central and peripheral nervous system ? How are the components of central nervous system protected ? ,Central Nervous System : It is hollowed part of nervous system that lies along the mid-dorsal part of the body. It has two parts-brain and spinal cord. Peripheral Nervous System : It is solid lateral part of nervous system that develops from CNS and connects different parts of the body with CNS. Peripheral nervous system has two components : Voluntary and Involuntary–Voluntary peripheral nervous system is under the control of will. It consists of cranial nerves from brain and spinal nerves from spinal cord. Involuntary peripheral nervous system works independent of will. Involuntary peripheral nervous system is also called autonomic nervous system. It has two parts– sympathetic and parasympathetic. They control the functioning of various internal body parts. Protection of brain : Cranium. Protection of spinal cord : Vertebral column.
 What is the function of mid brain ?  Name the three different parts of hind brain and give one function of each. ," Mid brain controls many of the involuntary actions.  Hind brain : It has three parts :  Pons  Medulla  Cerebellum. Functions :  Pons has centre for regulating the breathing rhythm.  Medulla controls involuntary functions like blood pressure, salivation, vomiting etc.  Cerebellum is responsible for 		 Precision or co-ordination of voluntary actions. 		 Maintaining the posture and balance of the body.  1"
 Draw a neat labelled diagram of human brain.  Name the gland that secretes insulin. Why are some patients of diabetes treated by giving injections of insulin ? ," Human brain : Short Answer Type Questions-IIQ 1. Pg. 164.  Pancreas secretes insulin. Insulin helps to lower the blood glucose level. When it is secreted in less amount, the body suffers from diabetes, as more and more glucose accumulates in the body. So, to reduce the level of glucose in the blood of the diabetes patients, they are provided with insulin injections."
What are hormones ? Give the name of associated gland and functions of different animal hormones. ,"Hormones are the chemical substances which co-ordinate and control the activities of living organisms and also their growth. S. No. Hormone Endocrine Gland Location Functions Neck/Throat region Regulation of metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Thyroxine Thyroid Growth hormone Pituitary  Adrenaline Adrenal Above both kidneys Regulation  of blood pressure, heart beat, carbohydrate metabolism  Insulin Pancreas Below stomach Reduces and regulates blood sugar level Testosterone in males Testis Genital/lower abdomen area Changes associated with puberty  Estrogen in females Ovaries Genital/lower abdomen area Changes associated with puberty  Regulates growth development. and"
 Define hormone. Write any four characteristics of hormones in humans.  Name the disorder caused by following situations  Under secretion of growth hormone.   Over secretion of growth hormone.  Under secretion of insulin.  Deficiency of Iodine., Hormones are the chemical substances which co-ordinate and control the activities of living organisms and also their growth. Characteristics of hormones are :  They are chemical messengers  Regulate behaviour of target cells.  They stimulate the target organs.  They are proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous in nature.   Dwarfism 		 Tallness 		 Diabetes 		 Goitre
 Name two hormones secreted by pancreas. Write one function of each hormone.  How does our body respond when adrenaline is secreted into the blood ?  Cite an example to explain the feedback mechanism for regulation of hormonal secretion.," Insulin : Regulates sugar metabolism, maintain blood sugar level. Glucagon : Increases blood sugar level.  Blood takes adrenaline to its target sites : Our heart beats faster resulting in more supply of O2 and glucose to our muscle. In liver, glycogen changes into glucose. Breathing increases. This makes more O2 available. Blood supply to digestive system and skin is reduced and more blood is passed to skeletal muscles.  The timing and amount of hormone released are regulated by feedback mechanism. Example : When sugar level in blood rises more insulin is secreted. Insulin removes extra glucose from the blood by converting into glycogen. Falling glucose level reduces insulin secretion by pancreas. CONTROL AND CO-ORDINATION"
