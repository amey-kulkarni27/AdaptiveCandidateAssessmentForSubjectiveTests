0,"Q. 1. What is excretion ? How do unicellular organisms remove their wastes ? [Board Term I, Set(13), 2011]",Ans. The biological process which involves the removal (1 mark each) (2 marks each) of harmful metabolic wastes from the body is called excretion. Unicellular organisms remove their waste by simple diffusion.
1,Q. 2. Why is nitrogen considered an essential element? How do plants acquire nitrogen ? ,Ans. Nitrogen is an essential element used in the synthesis of proteins and other compounds. It is taken up in the form of inorganic nitrates (or nitrites) or as organic compounds prepared by bacteria from atmospheric nitrogen.
2,Q. 3. What are the methods used by plants to get rid of excretory products? ,"Ans. Plants use a variety of techniques to get rid of waste materials— Exchange of gases through stomata, waste material may be stored in the cell-vacuoles or as gum and resin, removed in the falling or excreted into the surrounding soil."
3,Q. 4. How water enter continuously into the root xylem? ,"Ans. Water enters into the root xylem by the process of diffusion through root hairs. During photosynthesis water is constantly evaporated, this creates a kind of suction from the cells of a which pulls up water through the xylem vessel."
4,Q. 5. How do leaves in plants help in excretion? ,"Ans. Leaves of plants helps in excretion in many ways. Excess of water in plants is excreted by transpiration and guttation, that takes place through leaves. Carbon dioxide and oxygen that can be considered as waste products of respiration and photosynthesis respectively are excreted through stomata present on leaves."
5,"Q. 6. Write two major components of human urine. [Board Term I, Set (15), 2011]","Ans. The two major component of human urine are : (i) Urea, (ii) Uric acid."
6,"Q. 7. Major amount of water selectively reabsorbed by the tubular part of nephron in humans. What are the factors on which the amount of water reabsorbed depends ? [Board Term I, Set (17), 2011]",Ans. It depends on the amount of : (i) Excess water is present in the body. (ii) Dissolved waste is to be excreted from the body. 1
7,"Q. 8. What is the function of the following : (i) Renal artery, (ii) Renal Vein. ",Ans. (i) Renal artery : It brings the impure blood containing wastes substances into the kidney. (ii) Renal vein : It carries away the pure blood from the kidney.
8,Q. 9. List two major steps involved in the formation of urine and state in brief their functions. ,"Ans. Filtration : Nitrogenous waste such as urea or uric acid are removed from the blood (capillaries). Reabsorption : Glucose, amino acids, salts and major amount of water are selectively reabsorbed."
9,"Q. 10. List any four strategies used by the plants for excretion. [Board Term I, Set (34), 2011]","Ans. Strategies used by plants for excretion are : (i) They can get rid of excess water and oxygen through stomata. (ii) Many plant waste products are stored in cellular vacuoles. (iii) Waste products may be stored in leaves that fall off. (iv) Waste products are stored as resin and gums, especially in old xylem."
10,Q. 1. List some important functions of kidney.,Ans. The main functions of kidneys are : (i) Nephrons are the basic filtration unit of human beings. It removes poisonous substances such as urea and other salts along with excess water from the blood and urine that is excreted out from the body. (ii) It regulates the osmotic pressure / water balance of the blood. (iii) It regulates pH of the blood.
11,Q. 2. What are the methods used by plants to get rid of excretory products ? ,"Ans. Some of the methods employed by plants to get rid of excretory products are : (i) Gaseous wastes (CO2, water vapour, O2) are removed through ‘stomata’ in leaves and ‘lenticels’ in stems and released into the air. (ii) Plants get rid of excess water by transpiration. (3 marks each) (iii) Some waste products are stored as resins and gums."
12,Q. 3. (i) What is the filtering unit of kidney ? (ii) Why is it called so ?,"Ans. (i) Nephron is the filtering unit of kidney. (ii) Nephron is called, so because it filters the blood and remove the poisonous nitrogenous waste like urea and uric acid, excess of water from it. These harmful products gets filtered and useful products are reabsorbed by tubular part of nephron. Thus, harmful waste is excreted out as urine from the body."
13,Q. 4. Mention the pathway of urine starting from the organ of its formation. Name four substances which are reabsorbed from the initial filtrate in the tubular part of the nephron. ,"Ans. Kidney → Ureters → Urinary bladder → Urethra Glucose, amino acids, salts and major amount of water.  Detailed Answer : The pathway of urine starting from the organ of its formation is : Kidney → Ureters → Urinary bladder → Urethra. The four substances reabsorbed from initial filtrate are— (i) Amino acid (ii) glucose (iii) salts (iv) major amount of water."
14,Q. 5. Name one nitrogenous waste present in urine. What is the basic filtration unit of kidney called? How is the amount of urine produced regulated ? ,Ans. Nirogenous waste present in urine is uric acid or Urea. The basic filtration unit of kidney is nephron. Urine production is regulated by— (i) amount of excess water in the body (ii) amount of dissolved wastes that need to be excreted.
15,Q. 6. (a) Name the following : (i) The three carbon molecule that is formed due to break-down of glucose during respiration. (ii) The nitrogenous waste that is removed from the blood in our kidneys. (b) How do unicellular organisms generally remove waste ?,Ans. (a) (i) The three carbon molecule formed due to break-down of glucose during respiration is pyruvate. (ii) Urea. (b) Unicellular organisms generally remove waste by the process of diffusion from the body surface into the surrounding water.
16,Q. 7. Define excretion. Write two vital functions of kidney. ,Ans. Refer to short Answer Type I Q.1 Pg. 147 and S.A. I Type II Q. 1. Pg. 147.
