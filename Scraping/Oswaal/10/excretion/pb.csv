"In the diagram given below. Ankita labelled the diagram as—   Stomatal pore  Guard cell  Nucleus  Chloroplast Is she correct ? If not, then do the correct labelling ?","No, she was not correct. Correct labelling should be :  Guard cell  Nucleus  Chloroplast  Stomatal pore "
Shyama and Rehana prepared temporary mounts of leaf peel separately. Shyama obtained a clear slide whereas Rehana observed irregular patches when observed under a microscope. What could be the possible anomaly in Rehana’s slide preparation and how it can be eliminated ? ,The possible anomaly is the formation of air bubbles. Place the coverslip over the peel gently with the help of a needle. 
Johanson observed the temporary mount of a leaf peel under a compound microscope and found one pore as an elliptical pore and the other kidney shaped. Name the parts. ,Elliptical shape pore is stoma. Kidney shape is guard cells. 
State the importance of stomata for a plant. ,Importance of Stomata—  Helps in exchange of gases like O2 and CO2.  Removes extra water from leaves by transpiration.  1 + 1
In an experiment to prepare the temporary mount of a leaf peel to show stomata why glycerine and safranin are used ? , Leaf peels are mounted in glycerine to prevent it from drying.  Safranin is used to stain the leaf peels.
Mention any two functions of epidermis. ," Epidermis on the aerial parts of plants often secrete a waxy, water resistant layer on their outer surface.  They prevent water loss, mechanical injury and invasion by parasitic bacteria or fungi. "
"A student prepared the temporary mount of stained leaf peel. After observing the slide under microscope, he drew the following sketch. Identify and name the parts labelled as A, B, C and D. ", Chloroplast  Stomatal pore or stoma  Guard cell  Nucleus
"In the given figure label the structures I, II, III, and IV marked in the diagram.",I – Epidermal cells 		II – Chloroplast 		III – Nucleus 		IV – Stoma.
Why upper surface of the leaf has fewer stomata ?,Fewer stomata on the upper surface prevent excessive loss of water due to transpiration as this surface is directly exposed to sunlight.
What precautions should be taken to study the liberation of carbon dioxide gas during aerobic respiration ?,Precautions are :  Ensure that the experimental set-up is air-tight.  KOH is corrosive. Handle it carefully.
Why KOH solution is kept in the test-tube inside the air-tight conical flask while doing the experiment of respiration of seeds ?,KOH solution kept in the test-tube inside the airtight conical flask absorbs the evolved carbon dioxide released by germinating seeds thereby creating a partial vacuum in the conical flask. So an equal volume of water rises up in the tube. This indicates that the germinating seeds are actively respiring and evolving carbon dioxide gas during the process of respiration.
Why a leaf is boiled in alcohol before doing starch test ?,The leaf is boiled to remove its chlorophyll. Green colour of chlorophyll might hinder the reaction of starch with iodine.
