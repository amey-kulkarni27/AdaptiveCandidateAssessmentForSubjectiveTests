questions,answers
"In human, digestion starts in mouth. Which component of food breaks down in mouth ? What is the reason behind it ?","Starch breaks down in mouth, salivary glands present in the mouth secrete saliva. Saliva contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that breaks down starch to give sugar ."
Energy and food material are also required by plants. From where do plants fulfill these requirements ?,"Plants obtain energy and food material from inorganic sources in the form of carbon dioxide and water by the process of photosynthesis. During the process of photosynthesis, green plants take in carbon dioxide and water and convert them into carbohydrates and oxygen in the presence of light and chlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant."
"In a croton leaf, which areas of the leaf contains starch, green or yellow ? Give the reason for your answer.","Green areas of croton leaf contain starch. Starch is formed during the process of photosynthesis which takes place in the presence of chlorophyll. Yellow areas of croton leaf do not contain chlorophyll hence unable to form starch. Green areas contain chlorophyll, hence produce starch."
 What prevents the entry of food into trachea while swallowing ?  Why rate of breathing is faster in aquatic animals as compared to terrestrial animals ?, Epiglottis : It covers the opening of wind pipe during swallowing.  Because the amount of dissolved O2 in water is less as compared to the air in atmosphere.
How are the alveoli designed to maximise the exchange of gases ?  3," The alveoli are thin walled and richly supplied with a network of blood vessels to facilitate exchange of gases between blood and the air filled in alveoli.  Alveoli have balloon like structure. Thus, provide maximum surface for exchange of gases."
What constitutes one heart beat ? Is the pulse rate same as heart beat rate ?,"Heart beat is due to the rhythmic contraction and relaxation of heart muscles. One contraction  and one relaxation  of heart constitute one heartbeat. The pulse rate is same as heart beat rate. The rhythmic contraction of the heart is felt in certain areas like the wrist in the form of pulsations, and this is called pulse rate."
What is the need of four-chambered heart in mammals while fishes have only two-chambered heart ?,"Mammals need more energy to maintain their body temperature that’s why they have four chambered heart. In the mammal heart, the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood is not allowed to mix, and this is achieved by the separation of the heart into right side and left side. Such a separation of heart provides an efficient method of supplying oxygen to the body. Fish have two chambered heart and oxygenation of blood takes place in the gills and passes directly to the rest of the body."
"During summer season we drink a lot of water in comparison to winter, yet we pass urine fewer times in summer than in winter. What is the reason behind this fact ?","During summer season, we lose a good amount of water through perspiration to keep our body temperature normal. While in winter, there is no perspiration. That is why, in summer season we drink a lot of water and pass urine fewer times. 3"
Do the freshwater animals reabsorb water through their excretory system like marine animals ? Justify your answer.,"The freshwater animals do not reabsorb water through their excretory system because in case of fresh water animals, large amount of water is taken up through their skin and mouth. The water content of the body is maintained by getting rid of excess water through excretory system. Marine animals need to conserve water that’s why water is reabsorbed by excretory system in marine animals."
The inner lining of the small intestine contains numerous villi. Are villi helpful in food absorption ? Give the reason behind your answer.,"The major part of the process of digestion of food takes place in the small intestine. The digested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner lining of the small intestine contains numerous finger like projections called villi. The villi increase the surface area for absorption. Each villus is covered by a single layer of epithelium and contains blood vessels and lymph vessel. The food diffuses through the epithelium into the blood vessels. Glucose, amino acids, minerals and vitamins are absorbed in the blood vessels of the villi; the fatty acids and glycerol are absorbed by lacteals, which are carried to lymph vessels to the point where the lymph vessels empty into the blood stream."
