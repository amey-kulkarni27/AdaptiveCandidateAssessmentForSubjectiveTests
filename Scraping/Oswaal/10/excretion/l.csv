"Artificial kidney is a device to remove nitrogenous waste products from the blood through dialysis. In case of kidney failure, an artificial kidney can be used. Dialysis is the procedure used in artificial kidney to replace a non-functional or damaged kidney. In the process, blood of the patient is allowed to pass through the long cellulose tubes dipped in a tank containing dialysing solution having same ionic concentration as plasma. The waste substances diffuse out of blood into the tank and the cleansed blood is returned back into the patient through a vein. (i) What is the unit of kidney ? (ii) ‘‘Problems of heart that can be accelerated by bad kidney and vice-versa.’’ Comment on this statement by giving reason. (iii) What are the functions of kidney ?","(i) Nephron. (ii) When kidney fails, toxins start pooling up and the functioning of heart automatically decreases. Heart disease is largely caused by irregular lipid levels, which also lead to kidney problems. (iii) Functions : 		(a) It helps in the ultrafiltration of urine. 		(b) It regulates the osmotic pressure/water balance of the blood."
