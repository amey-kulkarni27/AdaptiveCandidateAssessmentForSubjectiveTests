" Shruti draws magnetic field lines close to the axis of a current carrying circular loop. As she moves away from the centre of circular loop, she observes that the lines keep on diverging. Explain the reason for her observation.  Write two properties of magnetic field lines.  3", At every point of current carrying circular loop the concentric circles representing the magnetic field around it would become larger and larger as we move away from the wire because magnetic field becomes weaker at larger distance.   The direction of magnetic field lines is from North to South outside the bar magnet and from South to North inside the magnet.  They never intersect each other. 
"Temporary magnets and permanent magnets play an important role in our day to day life. A magnet has the ability to attract the magnetic elements. Permanent magnets are made of carbon steel, chromium steel and some alloys like Alnico and Nipermag. Permanent magnets are used in many objects which are necessary for our lives. Magnets are used in junk yard to make new cars and in roller-coasters too.  State the objectives for this observation.  Estimate the values of electromagnets used by people around you."," Objectives : To understand the need to have temporary and permanent magnets. To understand the need to use different materials for making magnets.  Uses of Electromagnets : Used in electric bells, loudspeakers, electric motors, telephone diaphragms, electric fan and for sorting scrap metal and for extraction in hospitals, etc."
Suddenly the news spread in the school that the fire had broken out in examination room. All the important papers and office documents were burnt. The reason for this mishap was short circuiting. What is short circuiting and what precautions can be taken to avoid such tragic incidents ?,"Short-circuiting takes place if live wire and neutral wire come into direct contact due to damage of insulation of live wire. Use fuse, connecting wire should be of good quality, wire should be properly insulated externally. Associated Value : The learners will become more educated to handle emergency situation like electric fire more carefully."
"One day science teacher was teaching in her class, one of her student was very sad. The teacher asked her the reason, the way she responded amazed the students in the class room. She told the teacher of the mishap which took place in her locality where four members of a family died, as they were trying to steal electricity by connecting the conducting wire with the live wire on the street. Now do you think is this practice of electricity theft good, how does one’s conscience allow it ? What advice would you like to give to improve such mind set ?","No, electricity theft is not good. Proper connection, billing, safety measure can save both property and life which is more precious. Associated Value : The learners will be able to appreciate the role of being a responsible citizen and not to involve in any unlawful and risky events like electricity theft etc."
"In the birthday party of Bharat, his parents gave slinky to each friend as a return gift. The next day during the school, their teacher explained them about the production of magnetic fields using current carrying coils and also said that they can make permanent magnet using such coils by passing high current through them. Teacher also explained the uses of solenoid.  What values did Bharat’s parents exhibit towards his son ?   What type of field is produced by solenoid ?"," Knowledge, Sharing and playing with studies.  Magnetic Field."
