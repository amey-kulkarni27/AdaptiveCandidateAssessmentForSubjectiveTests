Can two magnetic lines of force intersect each other ? Give reasons in support of your answer. 3 ,"No, two magnetic lines of force never intersect each other. If two magnetic lines of force intersect each other then at the point of intersection there will be two different directions of magnetic field which is not possible."
The deflection of the compass needle increases as it is moved towards the pole of a bar magnet. Why ? 3,"The magnetic field due to a bar magnet is highest near its two poles. Therefore, the force exerted by the bar magnet on the compass needle is larger in such a region. That is why the deflection of the compass needle increases when it is moved towards the pole of a bar magnet."
"Sita wants to determine the direction of a force, experienced by a straight current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field which is perpendicular to it. Which rule will she apply to determine it ?","Sita will apply Fleming’s left hand rule. According to Fleming’s left hand rule, when the forefinger, the central finger and the thumb of the left hand are stretched mutually perpendicular to each other and if the forefinger points in the direction of the magnetic field, the central finger in the direction of current, then the thumb points in the direction of force on the conductor."
A coil of insulated copper wire is connected to a galvanometer as shown in the diagram. State your observations when a bar magnet is : (i) Pushed into the coil with its north pole entering first. (ii) Held at rest inside the coil. (iii) Name the phenomenon responsible for the above observation.,(i) Momentary deflection in the needle of galvanometer say to the right. (ii) Deflection of the galvanometer drops to zero. (iii) Electromagnetic Induction.
All the household electric appliances are connected in parallel. List two advantages of this type of arrangement.,"Two advantages : (i) To have equal potential difference across each appliance. (ii) Each appliance has separate switch to ON / OFF the flow of current through it, so that each circuit can work independently."
How would the strength of magnetic field due to current carrying loop be affected if : (i) Radius of the loop is reduced to half its original value ? (ii) Strength of current through the loop is doubled ? 3,(i) Strength of magnetic field gets doubled and increases. (ii) Strength of magnetic field gets doubled and increases.
Where do we connect a fuse; with a live wire or with a neutral wire ? What happens if the fuse wire is connected to neutral wire ?,"Fuse is always connected to live wire. If fuse wire is connected to neutral wire instead of live wire then even when the fuse burns out, the appliance remains connected to the live wire and the current supply will not be disrupted due to over loading. 3"
Is it possible to change the polarity of an electromagnet ? Give any two uses of electromagnets.,"Yes, we can change the polarity of an electromagnet by reversing the direction of current. Uses of electromagnets : (i) In electric bells (ii) For separating magnetic substances such as iron and other metallic substances from metallic scrap."
"In a three pin plug, the earth pin is thicker and longer than the live and the neutral pins. Why ? 3",The earth pin is thicker so that it does not enter into the live or neutral sockets. It is longer so that the earth connection is made first. This ensures the safety of the users.
The given figure shows a closed coil connected to a galvanometer G. The galvanometer shows a deflection to the right when N-pole of the bar magnet is brought closer to the coil AB. (i) Why does the deflection occur in the galvanometer ? (ii) State the observation when : 		(a) the coil is moved away from N-pole 		(b) both the coil and magnet are moved to the right with the same speed.,"(i) As the magnet is moved closer to coil AB, the flux linked with the coil increases. This set up induced current in the coil as shown by deflection in the galvanometer. (ii) (a) The direction of induced current in the coil AB is reversed and the galvanometer shows a deflection to the left. 		(b) When both the magnet and the coil AB are moved towards right with the same speed, the flux linked with the coil does not change. No induced current is set up. Hence no deflection is shown by the galvanometer."
