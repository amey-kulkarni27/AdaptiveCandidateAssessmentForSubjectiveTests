 What is meant by the terms alternating," Electromagnetic induction : The process by which a change in magnetic field in a conductor induces a current in another conductor.   There is deflection in galvanometer connected with coils, due to induced current. 		 Deflection becomes zero. 		 Deflection in galvanometer is in opposite direction. Reason :  E.M. induction takes place because field is changing.  Since current becomes stationary, no change in field takes place. So no EM induction.  E.M. induction takes place but induced current is in opposite direction. "
Explain the meanings of the words “electro magnetic‘‘ and ‘induction‘ in the term electromagnetic induction. List three factors on which the value of induced correct produced in the circuit depends. Name and state the rule to determine the direction of induced current. State one practical application of this phenomenon in everyday life.,‘Electromagnetic‘ stands for the property by which magnetism developed by a current of electricity. ‘Induction‘ stands for the action or process of bringing about or giving rise to something. Induced current depends on : e  The strength of magnetic field used.  Current in the coil P is started by closing the key.  The rate of change of magnetic flux associated with 		 Current continues to flow in coil P. the coil. 		 Current in coil P is stopped by removing the key.  The conductor in the form of coil of many turns of 		 Explain the reason for such observation. insulated wire.  Rule : Fleming right Hand Rule Statement : Refer to Quick Review.

 Draw a schematic labelled diagram of domestic electric circuit.  Why is it necessary to provide–  a fuse in an electric circuit  an earth wire to electric application metallic body? Explain.  current and direct current ?  Name a source of alternating current and a source of direct current.  Mention the frequency of AC supply in India.  State two important advantages of alternating current over direct current. , Refer to know the terms.  Source of AC current — electric generator. Source of DC current — electric cell.  Frequency of alternating current in India is 50 Hz.   Alternating current reverses its direction periodically but direct current always flow in one direction.  AC electric power can be transmitted over long distances without much less of energy while DC not.
 Define electromagnetic induction.  Two coils P and S are wound over the same iron core. Coil P is connected to battery and key and the coil S is connected to galvanometer. Write your observations when :,Earth wire Live wire 220 V Neutral wire Electricity board's fuse Electricity mefer Distribution Box containing main switch and fuses for each circuit Fig. A schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuits   It prevents damage to appliance due to overloading or short-circuiting.  Earth wire is connected to a metallic body buried deep inside earth. It is used as safety measure. It provides a low resistance conducting path for the current any leakage of current to a metallic body does not give shock to user.  2
" Explain what is the difference between a direct current and an alternating current. Write one important advantage of using alternating current.  An air conditioner of 2kW is used in an electric circuit having a fuse of 10A rating. If the potential difference of the supply is 220 V, will the fuse be able to withstand, when the air conditioner is switched on ? Justify your answer. "," The current whose direction gets reversed after every half cycle is called an alternating current or AC. There is no change in the direction of DC. The most important advantage of using AC over DC is that in the AC mode electric power can be transmitted over long distances with less loss of power.  Here P = 2kW = 2000W, V = 220 Volt P 2000 P = VI, the current I == = 9.09 A V 220  Work with electric circuits in proper light.  Do not put your hand inside water being heated with immersion rod, when the rod is inside and on.  1×5"
" Explain two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits and appliances.  An electron enters a magnetic field at right angles to it as shown in figure. What will be the direction of force acting on the electron ? State the rule which gives direction of force on electron.  If instead of electron, a neutron enters a field, what will be its direction of motion ? Give reason for your answer. "," Fuse being a wire of low melting point, it melts when a large current flows due to short-circuiting or overloading. Earthing of appliance—Earth wire is connected to a plate deep in the earth. If there is leakage of current, it goes to earth.  Electron will move in a direction perpendicular to As the current is 9.09 A, below the rating of fuse, the fuse will withstand i.e., it will not blow off the plane of paper and into it. when AC is on. Flemings Left Hand Rule : Stretch the first three  fingers of the left hand mutually perpendicular"
"Describe any five safety measures that should to each other such that the forefinger points the be taken while dealing with electric appliances direction of magnetic field, the middle finger connected in domestic electric circuit. points the direction of current, then the thumb  will indicate the direction of force experienced by", To avoid shocks from electrical appliances use the conductor. It is applied to the direction of the proper-earthing arrangement. current and field perpendicular to each other. 1½  Replace old worn out and damaged wires with new set.  Neutron will continue to move in same direction  Put the main switch off when removing any fault in because no force will act on it since it carries no electric circuits. charge.  1  Wear rubber shoes and gloves while dealing with replacement of any appliance.
 The given figure shows a domestic electric circuit. Study this circuit carefully. List any two errors in the circuit and justify your answer.  S1 Main switch board Meter Fuse B2 B1 S2  Give one difference between the wires used in the element of an electric heater and in a fuse.  List two advantages of parallel connection over series connection. ," Two errors are : 		 Fuse is incorrectly connected to the neutral wire , it must be connected to the live wire . 		 Bulb B2 is not connected to the neutral wire. 		 Two switches S1 and S2 in both B1 circuit and no switch in bulb B2 circuit.  2  Element of electric heater—high melting point Element of fuse wire—low melting point   Each appliance has equal potential difference.  Each appliance has separate switch to ON/OFF the flow of current through it. "
