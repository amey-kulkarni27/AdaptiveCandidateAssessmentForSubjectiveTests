How does the resistance of a wire depend upon its radius ?,"As R ∝ l/A, R ∝ l/ r ∝ pr2, i.e. R ∝ l/r2."
"Though same current flows through the electric line wires and the bulb filament, yet only the filament of bulb glows. Give the reason behind it.","The resistance of electric line wires is very, very less than that of the filament of the bulb. Therefore, the current through high resistance filament produces more heat which makes it glow."
The heating elements of electric toasters and electric irons are made of an alloy rather than a pure metal. Why ?,The heating elements of electric toasters and electric irons are made of an alloy rather than a pure metal due to the following reasons :  Alloys do not oxidise readily at high temperature.  Alloys have higher resistivity than their constituent elements.
"For domestic purposes, we connect the electrical devices in parallel instead of connecting them in series. What are the advantages of connecting electrical devices in parallel ?","By connecting the electrical devices in parallel :  Each device gets the full or same voltage.  Each device gets proper current depending on its resistance.  If one device is switched off / on, other electrical appliances remain unaffected. That is why for domestic purposes we connect the electrical devices in parallel instead of connecting them in series."
 A large number of free electrons are present in metals. Why is there no current in the absence of electric field across it ?  V-I graphs for parallel and series combination of two metallic resistors are shown in figure. Which graph represents parallel combination ? Justify your answer.," In the absence of an electric field, the motion of the electrons in a metal is random. There is no net flow of charge across any section of the conductor. So no current flows in the metal.  As R = , clearly, slope of V-I graph gives resistance R. As graph B has a greater slope than A, so graph B represent series combination  and graph A represents parallel combination ."
A number of bulbs are to be connected to a single source. Will they provide more illumination when connected in parallel or in series ? Give reasons to justify your answer and also list two advantages of this type of arrangement.  3,"The bulbs will provide more illumination when connected in parallel as each bulb will get the required voltage/current and their illuminations will be added. In case the bulbs are connected in series, they will not get the required voltage and may even not glow. The bulbs should be connected in parallel because each bulb will show its maximum power or total resistance decrease hence greater current may be drawn from the cell. Advantages of parallel arrangement :  Voltage across each device is same and it can take current as per its resistance.  If one device is damaged, then others continue to work properly. "
"Explain the following ;  Why is tungsten used exclusively for filament of electric lamps ?  Why are the conductors of electric heating devices, such as bread toasters and electric iron made of an alloy rather than a pure metal ?  Why is series arrangements not used for domestic circuit ?  How does the resistance of a wire vary with its area of cross section ?  How many joules are there in one kilo watt hour ?  5"," Tungsten has a high melting point . It does not melt at high temperatures. It retains as much of heat generated, so that it becomes very hot and emits light.  Conductors of electric heating devices are made up of alloys because alloys do not oxidise readily at high temperatures, unlike metals. Also alloys have a greater resistivity as compared to their constituent pure metals.  Because if one component fails, the circuit is broken and none of the other components will work. Also components need currents of widely different values to operate properly. But in a series circuit, the current is constant throughout the electric device.  Resistance is inversely proportional to the area of cross-section of the wire. Thus, if the wire is thick, then resistance is less. If the wire is thin, then resistance is large.  The commercial unit of electrical energy is kilo-watt hour. 			 1 kilowatt hour = 1 kW × 1h 				 = 103 W × 3600s 				= 3.6 × 106 Ws. 		or 1 KWh = 3.6 × 106 J"
