questions,answers
Write SI unit of resistivity. ,Ohm metre .
What is commercial unit of energy ? ,Kilowatt hour or kWh.
What is electric power ? State its SI unit. ,Rate at which energy is consumed is called electric power. Its unit is watt.
Name the instrument used for measuring :  Potential difference  Current. , Voltmeter  Ammeter.
On what principle is an electric bulb based ?,Heating effect of current. 
Mention one reason why tungsten is exclusively used for making filaments of electric lamps. ,"Tungsten has a high resistivity and a high melting point. So, most of the power consumed by this, is dissipated in the form of heat."
How is an ammeter connected in a circuit to measure the current flowing through it ? ,In series.
What determines the rate at which energy is delivered by a current ? ,Electric power determines the rate at which energy is delivered by a current.
In a circuit if two resistors of 5 W and 10 W are connected in series. Compare the current passing through the two resistors. ,"In a series connection of resistors, same current passes through all the resistors. Hence, current will be same. Ratio of the current will be 1 : 1."
Why are coils of electric toasters and electric irons made of alloy rather than pure metals ? ,Alloys are preferred to make coils of toasters and irons because they have higher resistivity and do not oxidise easily at high temperature.
"Find the minimum resistance that can be made using five resistors, each of 5Ω. ","By connecting resistors in parallel, resistance 1Ω is obtained R 5Ω Req = = 1Ω n"
"Which is having more resistance—a 220 V, 100 W bulb or a 220 V, 60 W bulb. ","60 W bulb, because R ∝ 1 ·"
