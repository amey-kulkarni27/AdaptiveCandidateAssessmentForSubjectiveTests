0,Q. 1. State one difference between autotrophic and heterotrophic mode of nutrition. ,Ans. Autotrophic nutrition in which organisms prepare their own food from simple inorganic sources like carbon dioxide and water. Heterotrophic nutrition in which organisms do not synthesise their own food and is dependent on the autotrophic for obtaining complex organic substance for nutrition.

2,Q. 3. Where do plants get each of the raw materials required for photosynthesis ? ,Ans. The raw materials for photosynthesis are carbon dioxide and water. Terrestrial plants get carbon dioxide from environment and water from the soil. Aquatic plants obtain CO2 that is present in dissolved form in water. Water is simply absorbed by the parts of plant submerged in water. (2 marks each)
3,Q. 4. In Nutrition a necessity for an organism? Discuss. ,Ans. Nutrition is required to provide energy for the various metabolic processes in the body. It is essential for the growth of new cells and repair or replacement of worn out cells. It is needed to develop resistance against various diseases.
4,Q. 5. Write any two events that occur during photosynthesis. ,Ans. Plants have starch as the storage carbohydrate which act as internal energy reserve. But animals have glycogen as internal energy reserve.
5,Q. 7. What would happen if green plants disappear from earth? ,"Ans. If all plants were to be removed from the surface of Earth, there will be excess of carbon dioxide cause there are no plants to convert it into oxygen. Green plants are the sources of energy for all organism, all herbivores will die due to starvation."
6,"Q. 8. Why does herbivores have longer, small intestine than carnivores ? ",Ans. Herbivores have longer small intestine to allow the cellulose to be digested completely. Herbivores have longer intestine than carnivores to digest grass. The intestine would host many small bacteria that process and breakdown cellulose into glucose.

Site of Complete digestion : Small intestine in alimentary canal. End products formed are : Proteins ¾® Amino acids Carbohydrates ¾® Simple sugars Fats ¾® Fatty acids + Glycerol.
8,Q. 10. How is small intestine designed to absorb digested food? ,Ans. The digested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner lining of the small intestine has numerous finger-like projections called villi which increase the surface area for absorption. The villi are richly supplied with blood vessels which take the absorbed food to each and every cell of the body. 2
9,Q. 11. How are fats digested in our bodies? Where does this process take place. ,"Ans. Fats are digested in the small intestine. The secretion of liver, called bile, breaks down the large globules of fats into smaller globules. This is called emulsification of fats. The bile also makes the medium alkaline so that the pancreatic enzyme containing lipase further digest fats to form fatty acids."
10,"Q. 12. What are final products of carbohydrates, proteins and fats after their digestion ? ",Ans. Carbohydrates : Glucose Proteins : Amino acid½ Fats : Glycerol + Fatty acid
11,"Q. 13. Explain the significance of peristaltic movement that occur all along the gut during digestion. [Board Term I, Set (16) 2011, Set (1), 2010]",Ans. It is necessary to move the food in a regulated manner along the digestive tube so that it can be processed properly in each part. The lining of canal has muscles that contract rhythmically in order to push the food forward. 1 This is known as peristaltic movement.
12,Q. 14. Why does the medium become acidic in mouth ? What is the ill effect of this acidic medium ? How can this be prevented ? ,Ans. (i) Bacteria present in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food particles in the mouth that may bring down pH in the mouth below 5.5. (ii) Tooth enamel get corroded by the action of acids and tooth decay occurs. (iii) By cleaning the teeth with tooth paste which is basic in nature.
13,Q. 15. What function is served by the following : (i) Gastric Sphincter ? (ii) Anal Sphincter ? ,Ans. (i) Gastric Sphincter : Controls the release of food from the stomach to small intestine. (ii) Anal Sphincter : Controls the release of undigested waste from the rectum through the anus.
14,Q. 16. Some finger like projections are present in the inner wall of small intestine. Write their names ? Why are they important ? ,Ans. Small finger like projections are villi. They increase the surface area for absorption of digested food.
15,Q. 1. State the necessary conditions for auto trophic nutrition and name the by product. Mention the source of this by product. ,"Ans. Conditions necessary for autotrophic nutrition are : Sunlight, Chlorophyll, Carbon dioxide and water. By products are carbohydrates in the form of starch and oxygen."
16,Q. 2. Describe heterotrophic mode of nutrition and give its examples. Name the three types of this nutrition. ,"Ans. It is the mode of nutrition in which an organism cannot make its own food and depends on other organisms for food. All the animals including man, most bacteria and some fungi have heterotrophic mode of nutrition and these organisms are called heterotrophs. (3 marks each) Holozoic, Saprophytic and Parasitic. "
17,Q. 3. Write three events which occur during the process of photosynthesis. ,Ans. Three event which occur during photosynthesis : (i) Absorption of light energy by chlorophyll. (ii) Conversion of light energy to chemical energy and splitting of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. (iii) Reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates.  1 + 1 + 1
18,Q. 4. Where does digestion start in our alimentary canal ? Name the enzyme secreted in that part and write its function. ,Ans. Digestion starts in the buccal cavity in the mouth. The enzyme secreted in buccal cavity is salivary amylase. Salivary amylase enzyme help in the digestion of starch.
19,Q. 5. Name three different glands associated with the digestive system in humans. Also name their secretions. ,"Ans. S. No. Name of the glands Name of Secretions (i) Salivary glands Saliva contains enzyme, ptyalin (ii) Gastric glands Secretes gastric juice, HCl, mucus, pepsin. (iii) Liver Bile juice. (iv) Intestinal glands Intestinal juice. (v) Pancreas Pancreatic juice which contains trypsin, lipase and amylase. (Any three) 1 + 1 + 1 "
20,Q. 6. (i) Name the extensively coiled structure of alimentary canal. (ii) Compare length of the small intestine in herbivores and carnivores. ,Ans. (i) Small intestine. (ii) Herbivores have longer small intestine for digestion of cellulose while carnivores have a shorter small intestine due to early digestion of meat.  1 + 2
21,"Q. 7. In human alimentary canal, name the site of complete digestion of various components of food. Explain the process of digestion. ","Ans. Small intestine. Secretions of liver and pancreas mixes with food. Pancreatic enzymes make it alkaline. Bile juice from liver too helps in it. Bile salts break the fat present in the form of large globules into smaller ones, increasing the efficiency of enzyme action. Enzymes like trypsin digests proteins and lipase breaks down fats. Intestinal juice convert proteins to amino acids, complex carbohydrate to glucose and fat into fatty acids and glycerol. "
22,Q. 8. The inner lining of the small intestine has numerous finger like projections. What are they called ? List their functions. ,Ans.Villi.
