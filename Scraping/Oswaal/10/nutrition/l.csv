0,Q. 1. Mention the organ and site of photosynthesis in green plants. What are the raw materials essential for this process ? How are they obtained ? Write complete balanced chemical equation for the process. Name the byproducts. ,Ans. (i) Photosynthesis takes place in the grana and stroma of the chloroplast (Plastid) in green plants. (ii) The raw materials required for this process are carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll. (iii) Carbon dioxide enters into the leaves through stomata and cells of the roots absorbs water from the soil. (iv) Balanced equation for photosynthesis— Chlorophyll → C6H12O6 + 6O2. 6CO2 + 6H2O  Sunlight (v) The byproducts in this process is the evolution of oxygen gas.
1,Q. 2. (a) State the form in which the following are stored : (i) Unused carbohydrates in plants 		(ii) The energy derived from food in humans. (b) Describe the process of nutrition in Amoeba with the help of diagram.  (c) How does paramecium obtain its food ?  ,"Ans. (a) (i) Starch (ii) ATP (b) Food particle Ingested food Fresh food Nucleus Contractive particle Lysosome vacuole vacuole Old food vacuole Fresh food vacuole Old food vacuole Fig. Holozoic nutrition in Amoeba Protozoans like Amoeba capture food with the help of temporary finger-like processes called pseudopodia. As soon as Amoeba comes in contact with a food particle or prey, it throws pseudopodia all around the food particle. The tips of encircling pseudopodia fuse and the prey comes to lie in a vesicle or phagosome. This method of intake of food is called circumvallation. Amoeba can also ingest food by other methods like import circumfluence and invagination. (c) In paramecium, the food is taken in at a specific spot and is moved to this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface of the cell.  1 + 3 + 1"
2,"Q. 3. (a) Draw a well labelled diagram of human alimentary canal, and label the following parts : (i) Liver 		(ii) Pancreas 		(iii) Small intestine 		(iv) Large intestine. (b) What is peristaltic movement ? ",Ans.(a) Mouth (Buccal Cavity) Tongue Oesophagus Diaphragm Gall bladder (stores bile) Stomach Bile duct Liver Pancreas Small intestine Large intestine (Colon) Appendix Anus 2 marks for diagram + 2 marks for labelling = 4 (b) Peristaltic movement : The lining of alimentary canal has muscles that contract rhythmically in order to push the food forward. This is called peristaltic movements.  1
