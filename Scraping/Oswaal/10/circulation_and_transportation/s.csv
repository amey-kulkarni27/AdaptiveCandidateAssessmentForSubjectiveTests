What is the advantage of a four chambered heart in humans? ,The four-chambered heart allows us to send our deoxygenated blood to the the lungs and our clean blood to the rest of the body without mixing the two. The blood coming from the left side of the heart is oxygenated and ready to fuel the muscles. The blood coming to the right side of the heart is collected from all over the body is deoxygenated and carried towards the lungs for oxygenation. 2   1 
Why is blood circulation in human heart called double circulation? ,The blood circulation in human heart is called double circulation because the blood passes through the heart twice in one complete cycle of the body-once through the right half in the form of deoxygenated blood and once through the left half in the form of oxygenated blood.
Why do Veins have thin walls as compared to arteries? ,The walls of the arteries are found to be thicker than that of a Vein because the blood that is carried from the heart to the capillaries has more high pressure. As the blood flowing through the veins does not have much pressure as in that of the arteries their walls are thinner as compared to artery walls.
Differentiate between blood and Lymph. ,"S. No.  Blood is pumped Lymph is moved throughout the body by along through the the heart. normal function of the body  Blood contains red blood Lymph is a whitish cells, white blood cells and clear liquid in and platelets. which RBCs are absent"
How is the process of transpiration useful to plants ?," Upward movement of sap or water from roots to leaves.  Regulates temperature.  Under optimal condition, leaf can transpire its own weight of water in less than an hour.  Phloem tissues helps in transport of food.  Foodis transported in both upward and downward directions.  Transport of food in phloem required energy in the form of ATP.  1 + 1"
State the difference between transport of materials in xylem and phloem.   Explain how water and minerals are transported in plants ? ,Transport of materials in Xylem :  Xylem tissues helps in transport of water and minerals.  Water is transported upwards from roots to aerial parts of plants.  Transport in xylem requires physical forces such as transpiration pull. Transport of materials in Phloem :  Phloem tissues helps in transport of food  Food is transported in both upward and downward directions  Transport of food in phloem requires energy in the form of ATP
"Name the material transported by the following :  Xylem,  Pulmonary artery,  Pulmonary veins,  Phloem. ", Xylem : Transport water and minerals in plants.  Pulmonary artery : Transport deoxygenated blood from heart to lungs.  Pulmonary veins : Transport oxygenated blood from lungs to heart.  Phloem : Transport synthesised food in plants. ½
"Which mechanism plays an important role in transportation of water in plants ?  during day time,  at night. ", Transpirational pull.  Root pressure.
What is translocation ? How it take place in plants ? ,"Transport of soluble product of photosynthesis or food from leaves to other parts of plants is called translocation. For translocation, food molecules enter the part of the phloem called the sieve tubes where they can be transported upwards or downwards to all the parts of the plant including roots. Translocation is achieved by utilising energy from the ATP that provides osmotic pressure required for upward and downward movement of food."
State any two differences between arteries and veins.  ,Differences between arteries and veins : S. No.  Arteries Veins  They are thick walled. They are thin walled.  Arteries valves.  Carry oxygenated blood except pulmonary artery. have no They have valves. Carry deoxygenated blood except pulmonary vein.  1 + 1
Why is it necessary to separate oxygenated and deoxygenated blood by mammals and birds ? ,"Mammals and birds are warm-blooded animals. They constantly use energy to maintain their body temperature. They have higher energy needs and so they require more oxygen to produce energy. Thus, it is important that their oxygenated blood does not get mixed up with deoxygenated blood. 2"
Define transpiration. State its two functions.,The loss of water in the form of vapour from the aerial parts of the plants is known as transpiration.  Functions :  It helps in the absorption and upward movement of water and mineral dissolved in it from roots to the leaves.  It also helps in temperature regulation. 
 How does the transport of materials in xylem and phloem occurs ?  What is translocation ? , Xylem :  Transport of water and mineral.  Upward movement.  Phloem :  Transport of food and hormones.  Upward and downward movements .  Transport of soluble food by phloem is called translocation. 
Write three points of differences between artery and vein. ,"S. No. Artery Vein  Wall is thick. Wall is thin.  Valves absent. Valves present.  Blood flows from Blood flows from heart to different different organs to organs. heart.  The flow of The flow of blood blood is fast, is slow, steady and jerky and with with less pressure great pressure.  "
Give reasons for the following—  Arteries are thick walled blood Vessel.  Veins are thin walled blood Vessel  Veins have valves in them. , Thick walls of arteries help them to resist the pressure of flow of blood in them. Arteries are elastic so as to produce enough pressure to push the blood and help it flow.  Veins have thin walls because veins collect the blood from different organs and bring it back to the heart. The blood is no longer under pressure and blood flows only in one direction.  Main function of valve is to prevent back flow of blood. Since the blood pressure in veins is very low they have valves that prevent back flow of blood.
 What is lymph ?  How is composition of lymph different from blood plasma ?  List two functions of lymphatic system. , Lymph a colourless fluid containing white blood cells.  Lymph is colourless and contains less protein than plasma.  Functions :  Carry digested fat/absorption of fat.  Drains excess fluid from extracellular space back into the blood. 
Explain :  Blood goes only once through the heart in fishes.  Plants have low energy needs.  What are capillaries ? ," Because they do not maintain their own body temperature, therefore they do not require separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.  Because plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells.  Capillaries are smallest vessels which have one cell thick wall. The exchange of material between the blood and the surroundings take place through capillaries. "
 Mention the site of exchange of material between the blood and surrounding cells.  Draw a schematic representation of transport and exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. , Capillaries  Refer to below fig.  Detailed Answer :  Capillaries.  Schematic representation of transport exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Pulmonary artery to lungs Lung capillaries and Pulmonary vein from lungs Aorta to body Vena cave from body Capillaries in body organs apart from the lungs 		 Schematic representation of transport and 		 exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide
Describe the process of double circulation in human beings. ,"Double circulation has two components— Pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation. Pulmonary circulation is movement of blood from heart to the lungs and back from the lungs to the heart. Deoxygenated blood of the body enters the right auricle, passes into right ventricle which pumps it into pulmonary arch, two separate pulmonary arteries the blood passes into the lungs. Now Oxygenated blood from the lungs is carried block to the heart by : Pulmonary veins and enters into the left auricle of the heart Systemic Circulation is the circulation of blood between heart and different parts of the body except lungs. Oxygenated blood received by left auricle passes into left ventricle. The left ventricle pumps it into aorta for supply to different body parts including walls of the heart with the help of arteries. ½ + ½"
What would be the consequences of a deficiency of haemoglobin in our bodies ? ,"Haemoglobin efficiently binds with oxygen and then it transports oxygen to various parts of body. Deficiency of haemoglobin is referred to as anaemia. In such a condition, the blood is unable to carry the sufficient amount of oxygen required by the body. This would cause less respiration and less energy will be liberated. In anaemia, the person feels weak, pale, lethargic and unable to perform heavy physical work."
List the three kinds of blood vessels of human circulatory system and write their functions in tabular form. ,S. No.  Blood Vessels Arteries Function They carry blood away from the heart to various organs of the body.  Veins They collect blood from different organs and bring it back to the heart.  Capillaries Exchange of material between the blood and surrounding cells takes place across the thin walls of capillaries.  1 + 1 + 1
" Why do ventricles have thicker, muscular walls than atria ?  What are peristaltic movements ?  ‘Stomata remain closed in desert plants during day time.’ How do they do photosynthesis ? "," Since ventricles have to pump blood into various organs, they have thicker muscular walls than atria do.  The lining of alimentary canal has muscles that contract rhythmically in order to push the food forward. These are peristaltic movements.  In desert plant, stomata open at night and absorb CO2, and store it as an intermediate compound, that is converted into carbohydrate during the day time. "
Plants absorb water from the soil. Explain how does the water reach the tree top ? ,"Xylem  of roots, stems and leaves are interconnected to form a continuous column. Roots also take up mineral salts actively, water moves in and as a result, creating pressure which pushes the water up. Transpiration pull creates a suction force pulling up water. "
