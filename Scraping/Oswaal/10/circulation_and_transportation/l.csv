" State two advantages of transpiration to the plant body.   List in tabular form, two ways in which ‘transpiration’ is different from ‘translocation.’  Why do plants have a slow transport system ?"," Two advantages :  Helps in absorption and upward movement of water and minerals from roots to the leaves.  Temperature regulation. S. No. Transpiration Translocation  Plays role in transport of water and minerals It is a transport of soluble products of photosynthesis.  Occurs through xylem by simple physical forces. Occurs through phloem in the form of sucrose by utilising energy.   Because plants have a large proportion of dead cells in many tissues, they have low energy needs. So they use a slow transport system."
