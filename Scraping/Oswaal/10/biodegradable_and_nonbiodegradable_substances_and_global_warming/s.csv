What is ozone ? Show the reactions of formation of ozone from oxygen in the atmosphere. ,Ozone (O3) is a molecule formed by three atoms of oxygen. U.V. O2  → O+O O + O 2 → O3 Ozone
What is ozone ? How and where is it formed in the atmosphere ? Explain how does it affect an ecosystem. ,Ozone is a molecule containing three atoms of oxygen (O3)/ a highly poisonous gas present in the upper layer of the atmosphere. Formation of ozone — The UV radiations split some molecular oxygen (O2) apart into free oxygen atoms (O + O). These atoms then combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone. Or O2  → O +O () O + O2 → O3 				 (Ozone) Effect — Ozone layer shields the surface of the earth from damaging UV radiations of the sun. 1 
Explain the role of UV radiation in formation of ozone with the help of a chemical reaction. Name the pollutant and write its role in depletion of ozone layer. ,The high energy of UV radiations breakdown some molecules of O2 into atoms of oxygen. One atom of oxygen binds to one molecule of O to form O3. Ozone prevents UV rays to reach earth surface. O2 U.V. → O + O O2 + O → O3 (Ozone) Example : Chlorofluorocarbons.
