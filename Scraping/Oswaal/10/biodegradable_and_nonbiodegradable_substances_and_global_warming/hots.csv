0,Q. 1. Why do harmful chemicals concentrate as we go up in a food chain ?  3,"Ans. Harmful chemical concentrate in the trophic levels of food by the process of biological concentration or bio-magnification. The process of entry of a non– biodegradable chemical into a food chain and its getting accumulated at successive trophic levels, reaching the maximum quantity in the top most level is biological magnification."
1,"Q. 2. With the knowledge of energy transfer in the food chain, man can place himself at an advantageous position in the food chain. Explain.","Ans. When man places himself close to the producers, he gets more calories. Lower the distance from producer level, lesser the amount of calories available. This is due to the fact that at every trophic level 90 percent of energy is lost to the environment. e.g., (i) Two step food chain Producers 1000J. → Man (ii) Three step food chain J heat → Goat 900 → Man Producers 10,000 J. 1000 J."
2,Q. 3. Why are green plants called producers ? ,Ans. Green plants are also called producers because only they can synthesize organic food from inorganic raw materials with the help of solar energy in the process of photosynthesis. This food is not only used by green plants but also by other organisms called consumers.
3,"Q. 4. (i) What is biological magnification ? (ii) If the concentration of DDT is 0·2 ppm in water of lake, what would be its likely concentration in fish in the food chain ? Plankton → Fish → Fish eating birds.",Ans. (i) Biological Magnification : The increase in the concentration of a chemical per unit weight of the organisms with the successive rise in tropic level. 2 (ii) Water → Plankton → Fish → Fish eating bird (0.2ppm.) (5.0ppm) (240ppm) Concentration in Fish would be approximately 240 ppm.
4,Q. 5. Why are bacteria and fungi called decomposers ?3,"Ans. Most of the bacteria and fungi are saprophytes. They obtain their nourishment from organic remains. For this they secrete digestive enzymes over the remains. The remains are converted into soluble absorbable form. This results in decomposition of organic matter. Therefore, bacteria and fungi are called decomposers."
5,Q. 6. The use of pesticide DDT is discouraged since this chemical is found in human body. How does this chemical enter our body ?,"Ans. DDT enters through the food chain into the human body by the process called biomagnification or biological concentration. DDT is a non– biodegradable chemical that remains toxic in the soil for a long time, absorbed by the plants and thus, enters into the food chain. It gets accumulated at every successive trophic level reaching maximum quantity in the top–most trophic level."
6,Q. 7. Explain why there are greater chances of accumulation of harmful chemical in the body of human beings.,"Ans. Man is at the top of most food chains and hence, due to biological magnification there are greater chances of accumulation of harmful chemicals in the body."
7,"Q. 8. If all the waste we generate is biodegradable, will this have no impact on the environment ?  3","Ans. If all the waste we generate is biodegradable, impact on the environment will be minimum. The environment will be affected in making and extracting the raw-material used in their manufacture."
8,Q. 9. Why are some substances biodegradable and some non-biodegradable ?,"Ans. Substance which can be degraded and disposed off naturally by saprophytic organisms or decomposers are called biodegradable, e.g., organic remains, garbage, sewage, livestock waste. Substances which cannot be degraded by saprophytes are known as non-biodegradable. They are mostly manmade articles like pesticides, plastic, polythene etc. Biodegradable articles are formed naturally in biosphere. Decomposer organisms feed on them by secreting digestive juices and absorbing the solubilised substances. Biogenetic nutrients are released in the process called mineralization."
9,Q. 10. “Damage to the ozone layer is a cause of concern.” Justify the statement. Suggest any two steps to limit this damage.,"Ans. Cause of Concern : Ozone layer present in the stratosphere has thinned out by about 8% over the equator and more so over the Antarctica where a big ozone hole appears every year. This has increased the level of UV-B radiations reaching the earth by 15-20 %. These radiations are causing increased number of skin cancers, cataracts and reduced immunity in human beings. These causes increased incidence of blindness of animals, death of young ones, reduced photosynthesis, higher number of mutations and damage to articles. Steps to Limit Damage : (i) Ban on the production and use of halons. (ii) Ban on production and use of chlorofluorocarbons."
10,Q. 11. What are the advantages of cloth bags over plastic bags during shopping ?  5,Ans. Advantages of cloth bag : (i) Cloth bags are stronger and more durable as compared to plastic bags. (ii) They are washable. (iii) They can be used repeatedly. (iv) Cloth bags do not pollute environment. (v) They are made of biodegradable material which can be recycled.
