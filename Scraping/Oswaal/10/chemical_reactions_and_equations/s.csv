Write the steps for balancing the chemical equation for the formation of ammonia by the combination of nitrogen and hydrogen.  → NH3 .,"N2 + H2   Examine the number of atoms of different elements present in the unbalanced equation.  In the above reaction, left hand N2 and H2 of both the sides are unbalanced.  To balance hydrogen, H2 is multiplied by 3 on side. It makes 6H- atoms on the left hand side.  Now to balance hydrogen atoms on the right hand side, NH3 should be multiplied by 2. It makes 6Hatoms on this side.  Now to balance nitrogen atoms, they are counted separately for both the sides and we will find that, nitrogen atoms are 2 on both the sides.  Balanced chemical equation will be : → 2NH3 ½+½+½+½+½+½ N2 + 3H2 "
