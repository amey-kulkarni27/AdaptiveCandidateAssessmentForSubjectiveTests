Define a chemical reaction. State four observations which help us to determine that a chemical reaction has taken place. Write one example of each observation with a balanced chemical equation. ,Process in which new substances with new properties are formed by the rearrangement of atoms is known as chemical reaction. (i) Evolution of gas : The chemical reaction between zinc and dilute H2SO4. Zn(s) + H2SO4(aq) → ZnSO4(sq) + H2(g) ↑ (ii) Change in colour : The chemical reaction between potassium iodide solution and lead nitrate solution. Pb(NO3)2(aq) + 2KI → 2KNO3(aq) + PbI2(s) Colourless Yellow (iii) Formation of precipitate : The chemical reaction between sulphuric acid and barium chloride solution. BaCl2(aq) + H2SO4(aq) → 2HCl(aq) + BaSO4(s) White precipitate (iv) Change in temperature : The chemical reaction between quick lime and water. CaO(s) + H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2(aq) + Heat Quicklime  5
What is a balanced chemical equation ? Why should chemical equation be balanced ? ,"The equation in which atoms of various elements on both sides of a chemical equation are equal in accordance with the law of conservation of mass is known as balanced chemical equation. The chemical equation is to be balanced in accordance to the law of conservation of mass. It means the total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction has to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants. In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the same, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a chemical equation."

(ii) Oxidation Reaction : When an iron object is left in moist air for a considerable time, it gets covered with a red brown flaky substance called rust. (iii) Displacement reaction : More reactive metal displaces less reactive metal from its salt solution. (iv) Displacement reaction : More reactive metal displaces less reactive metal from its salt solution. (v) Double displacement reaction : Reaction in which two compounds react by an exchange of ions to form two new compounds. "
