Define a chemical reaction. State four observations which help us to determine that a chemical reaction has taken place. Write one example of each observation with a balanced chemical equation. ,Process in which new substances with new properties are formed by the rearrangement of atoms is known as chemical reaction.  Evolution of gas : The chemical reaction between zinc and dilute H2SO4. Zn + H2SO4 → ZnSO4 + H2 ↑  Change in colour : The chemical reaction between potassium iodide solution and lead nitrate solution. Pb2 + 2KI → 2KNO3 + PbI2 Colourless Yellow  Formation of precipitate : The chemical reaction between sulphuric acid and barium chloride solution. BaCl2 + H2SO4 → 2HCl + BaSO4 White precipitate  Change in temperature : The chemical reaction between quick lime and water. CaO + H2O → Ca2 + Heat Quicklime  5
What is a balanced chemical equation ? Why should chemical equation be balanced ? ,"The equation in which atoms of various elements on both sides of a chemical equation are equal in accordance with the law of conservation of mass is known as balanced chemical equation. The chemical equation is to be balanced in accordance to the law of conservation of mass. It means the total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction has to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants. In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the same, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a chemical equation."
Write balanced chemical equations for the following statements :  Bleaching powder is kept open in air.  Blue crystals of copper sulphate are heated.  Chlorine gas is passed through dry slaked lime.  Carbon dioxide gas is passed through lime water.  NaOH solution is heated with zinc granules. , CaOCl2 + CO2 → CaCO3 + Cl2 		 Bleaching Carbon dioxide Calcium Chlorine 		 powder carbonate  Heat → CuSO4 + 5H2O  CuSO4 . 5H2O  		 Blue White  Ca 2 + Cl2 → CaOCl2 + H2O Dry slaked lime Chlorine Bleaching powder  Ca2 + CO2 → CaCO3 + H2O Lime water Calcium carbonate  Heat → Na2ZnO2  2NaOH + Zn  H2 Sodium zincate Hydrogen  1 × 5
Identify the type of chemical reaction in the following statements and define each of them :  Digestion of food in our body  Rusting of iron  Heating of manganese dioxide with aluminium powder  Blue colour of copper sulphate solution disappears when iron filings are added to it  Dilute hydrochloric acid is added to sodium hydroxide solution to form sodium chloride and water. ," Decomposition Reaction : Carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose.  Oxidation Reaction : When an iron object is left in moist air for a considerable time, it gets covered with a red brown flaky substance called rust.  Displacement reaction : More reactive metal displaces less reactive metal from its salt solution.  Displacement reaction : More reactive metal displaces less reactive metal from its salt solution.  Double displacement reaction : Reaction in which two compounds react by an exchange of ions to form two new compounds. "
Write balanced chemical equations for the following statements :  NaOH solution is heated with zinc granules.  Excess of carbon dioxide gas is passed through lime water.  Dilute sulphuric acid reacts with sodium carbonate.  Egg shells are dropped in hydrochloric acid.  Copper  oxide reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid.  → Na2ZnO2 + H2, 2NaOH + Zn  → CaCO3 + H2O  Ca2 + CO2  → Ca2 CaCO3 + H2O + CO2  → Na2SO4 + H2O  Na2CO3 + H2SO4  + CO2 → CaCl2 + H2O + CO2  CaCO3 + 2HCl  → CuCl2 + H2O  CuO + 2HCl  
" List any three observations which determine that a chemical reaction has taken place. Also list three informations that cannot be obtained about a chemical reaction, merely by its chemical equation.  Balance the following chemical equations.  → Fe3O4 + H2  Fe + H2O  → C6H12O6 + O2  CO2 + H2O "," Three observations which determine that a chemical reaction has taken place are :  Change in state and colour.  Evolution of gas.  Change in temperature. Three informations that cannot be obtained about a chemical reaction, merely by its chemical equation are : 		 The state of a matter of the reactants and products. 		 Amount of heat evolved or absorbed in a reaction. 		 The change of colour after the chemical reaction.  Balanced chemical equations : → Fe3O4 + 4H2  3Fe + 4H2O  → C6H12O6 + 6O2  6CO2 + 6H2O "
