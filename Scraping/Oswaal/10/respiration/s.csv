Explain the cause of cramps after excessive physical exercise. ,"During strenous exercise, our body requires instant energy and it is fulfilled through anaerobic respiration. Muscle cells break down glucose to produce lactic acid and energy. A lot of lactic acid gets accumulated in our muscles and this causes muscle cramps."
How are the alveoli designed to maximise the exchange of gases? ,"The alveoli are adapted to make gas exchange in lungs efficiently. They give the lungs a really big surface area, they have moist, thin walls and they have a lot of tiny blood vessels called Capillaries. Air is sucked into the lungs and alveoli. When we breathe in the alveoli expand, and maximise the exchange of gases."
What is the benefit of residual volume of air in the respiratory process? ,It prevents our lungs to get burst out. It also prevent sticking of lung walls and provide nourishment to inner lungs during exhalation.
‘‘Respiration is an Exothermic Reaction.’’ Justify this statement giving the chemical equation for the reaction involved. ,"During respiration, the carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose. This glucose combine with oxygen in our cells and provide energy . C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + Energy. 1"
"When a sportsman runs, he often gets muscle cramps. Why ? ","In order to release more energy to perform sudden activity, pyruvate is converted into lactic acid in the lack of oxygen. Formation of lactic acid in muscles cause cramps or fatigue."
Stomata of desert plants remain closed during day time. How do they take up CO2 and perform photosynthesis ? ,Desert plants take up CO2 at night and prepare an intermediate molecule. The intermediate molecule is acted upon by the energy and absorbed by the chlorophyll during day.
How do guard cells regulate opening and closing of stomatal pores ? ,"The swelling of guard cells due to absorption of water causes opening of stomatal pores while shrinking of guard cell closes the pores. Opening and closing of stomata occur due to turgor changes in guard cells. When guard cells are turgid, stomatal pores is open while in flaccid conditions the stomatal aperture closes."
Leaves of a healthy potted plant were coated with vaseline. Will this plant remain healthy for long ? Give reasons for your answer.  ,This plant will not remain healthy for a long time because :  It will not get oxygen for respiration.  It will not get carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.  Upward movement of water and minerals would be hampered due to lack of transpiration.  1 + 1
Give reasons for the following :  Why is diffusion not sufficient to meet the oxygen requirements of all the cells in multicellular organisms ?  How desert plants perform photosynthesis if their stomata remain closed during the day ? ," All the cells in multicellular organisms may not be in direct contact with the surrounding environment. Thus, simple diffusion will not meet the O2 requirements of all the cells.  Desert plants take up carbon dioxide at night and prepare an intermediate compound which is acted upon by the energy and absorbed by the chlorophyll during the day."
Define breathing. Explain the mechanism of breathing in human beings. ,"Breathing is the process of letting in oxygen from air into the lungs and CO2 out of the lungs. Mechanism : Involuntary, rate controlled by brain. Outward and inward movement of ribs increases or decreases the space of thoracic cavity, action assisted by diaphragm continuous inhalation and exhalation of the air.   Detailed Answer : A physical process by which oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is given out is called breathing. Breathing in humans involves three steps :  Inspiration : When we breathe in, ribs move up and flatten the diaphragm due to which the chest cavity becomes larger. As a result air is sucked into the lungs and fills the expanded alveoli.  Gaseous exchange : Haemoglobin binds with the oxygen and carries it along the blood in the body. As blood passes through the tissues of the body, oxygen from the blood diffuses into the cell, whereas carbon dioxide which is produced during respiration diffuses into the blood and is carried to the lungs for expiration.  Expiration : Ribs move down and diaphragm becomes dome-shaped decreasing the chest cavity. Thus, pushing the air out from lungs."
Explain the activity with diagram to show that carbon dioxide is essential for photosynthesis. , Take two healthy potted plants which are nearly the same size.  Keep them in a dark room for three days.  Now place each plant on separate glass plates. Place a watch glass containing potassium hydroxide by the side of one of the plants. The potassium hydroxide is used to absorb carbon dioxide. Bell Jar Watch glass containing potassium hydroxide   Experimental set up  with potassium hydroxide  Without potassium hydroxide.
"With the help of a schematic flowchart, show the break down of glucose in a cell to provide energy :  in the presence of oxygen  in the absence of oxygen  when there is lack of oxygen. ",Absence of O2  Fermentation Glucose  In cytoplasm Glycolysis Pyruvate  Lack of O2  Presence of O2  
List three characteristics of lungs which make it an efficient respiratory surface. ," It has large surface area and branched.  Contain an extensive network of blood vessels. 1  It is thin, delicate and fine. "
List in tabular form the two differences between aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Why do we feel cramps in our muscles during sudden physical activity ? ,"Difference between Aerobic and Anaerobic respiration : S. No. Aerobic Respiration Anaerobic Respiration  Occurs in the presence Occurs in the absence of of oxygen. oxygen.  Releases large amount of Releases relatively small energy. amount of energy. During sudden physical activity, there is a lack of oxygen in our muscles cells, the pathway for Ethyl alcohol + E Lactic Acid + E  CO2 + H2O + E  3 the breakdown of pyruvate into lactic acid that develops cramps in the body."
How is carbon dioxide and oxygen transported in human being ? ,"When we inhale air, oxygen reaches the alveoli in lungs. Thin capillaries surround alveoli. These alveoli carry blood in them. The oxygen diffuses from the alveoli walls to the blood in capillaries. This blood travel all through the body. Haemoglobin binds with oxygen and carry it along the body. The O2 is present in the blood diffuses into the cells since the blood contain high concentration of oxygen while cells contain low concentration of oxygen. CO2 is produced as a waste product in respiration in the cells of tissues. This CO2 diffuses into the blood as the concentration of CO2 is low in blood. Blood carries CO2 back to lungs, where it diffuses into alveoli, then trachea, nostrils and then out of the body into air. CO2 is transported in dissolved form in our blood."
The rate of breathing in aquatic organisms is much faster than that seen in terrestrial organisms. Give reason. ,"A terrestrial organism can obtain oxygen directly from the air and have slow breathing rate but aquatic organisms have to obtain oxygen for respiration which is dissolved in water. Since, the amount of oxygen dissolved in water is fairly low as compared to the amount of oxygen in air the rate of breathing in aquatic organism is much faster."
Give reasons for :  Oxygenated and deoxygenated bloods are separate in the heart of mammals.  Ventricles are thick walled.  Herbivores have longer small intestine as compared to carnivores. ," This allows a highly efficient supply of oxygen, and meet their high energy needs .  Because they have to pump blood throughout the body or into various organs.  To allow cellulose to be digested. "
