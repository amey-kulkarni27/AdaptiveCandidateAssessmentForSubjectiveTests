How does it undergo damage due to eating chocolates and sweets ? What should we do to prevent it ?  How do  ions exist in water ? "," If H+ ion concentration is more, pH will be less and vice versa or pH of a solution is inversely proportional to H+ ion concentration or pH = –log .  This solution is neutral.  1M NaOH solution.  When the pH in the mouth is below 5.5, bacteria present in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and corrode the tooth enamel. It can be prevented by using tooth pastes which are generally basic.  As hydronium + ion.  5"
" Acids as well as bases ionize in water. Name the ions produced by each in water.  If we have hydrochloric acid and acetic acid of equal concentration, which will be a stronger acid and why ?  How will the concentration of hydrogen ions gets affected if an acid is diluted ? "," H+/H3O+ and OH– respectively.  Hydrochloric acid will be a stronger acid, because it produces more H+ ions.  Concentration of H+ decreases with increase in dilution."
 Bee-sting leaves a chemical substance that causes pain and irritation. Name the chemical substance. Identify the type of substance which may give relief on the sting area when applied on it.  Mention the pH value below which tooth decay begins. How this fall below this value ? Explain the ill effect of the acidic medium in the mouth. How can this be prevented ?  What are strong acids and weak acids ? Give an example of each. ," Methanoic acid . Use of Baking soda can give relief on the stung area when applied on it.  Tooth enamel, made of calcium phosphate does not dissolve in water, but it is corroded when pH is below 5.5 . Bacteria present in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food particles remaining in the mouth. It can be prevented by using tooth paste, which is generally basic to neutralise excess acid.  Strong acids : Those acids that give rise to more H+ ion concentration, e.g. HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. 1 Weak acids : Those acids that give rise to less H+ ion concentration, e.g. acetic acid, lactic acid. "
" A local magician was showing magic in a village street. He took egg shell and poured a solution over it. As a result, effervescence were formed. When he took a burning matchstick over it, it went off :  Identify the solution poured and the substance present in egg shell. 		 What is the reason behind effervescence ? 		 Write its balanced chemical equation. 		 Give the common name of the substance present in the egg shell.  Draw a labelled diagram to show that acid solution in water conducts electricity. ",  Solution is an acid. Substance in egg shell is calcium carbonate.  Effervescence is due to the evolution of CO2 gas.  2HNO3 + CaCO3 ¾® 2Ca2 + H2O + CO2 		 Lime stone.  6 Volt battery Bulb Switch Beaker Nail Dilute HCl solution Rubber Cock Fig. Acid solution in water conducts electricity

 Mention the pH range within which our body works. Explain how antacids give relief from acidity. Write the name of one such antacid.  How will the pH of fresh milk change as it turns to curd ? Explain your answer.   A milkman adds a very small amount of baking soda to fresh milk. Why does this milk take longer time to set as curd ?   Mention the nature of tooth pastes. How do they prevent tooth decay ? ," 7.0–7.8. During indigestion, stomach produces too much acid which causes pain. Antacids are alkaline and so neutralize the excess acid. Milk of Magnesia  The pH will decrease. The milk when changes to curd becomes more acidic because of lactic acid Lesser the pH value, more is the acidic nature.  pH will decrease, so that milk does not get spoilt / sour / when changed into curd. Because enzymes which can change milk to curd does not work in alkaline pH.  Tooth pastes are alkaline in nature. They neutralize the excess acid produced by bacteria in mouth. 1 "
