0,Q. 1. What is sustainable development ? State its two main objectives.,Ans. The development which can be maintained for a long time without undue damage to the environment. Two objectives : (i) To provide the economic well being to the present and future generation. (ii) To maintain a healthy environment and life support system.  ½
1,Q. 2. What is meant by “Sustainable management“ ? Why is reuse considered better than recycling. ,"Ans. “Sustainable development is the development which can be maintained for a longtime without undue damage to the environment. Ways to achieve sustainable development are to plant more trees. Recycling needs additional energy to make a usable item. Reuse does not require additional energy and hence, is better than recycle. "
2,Q. 3. What is sustainable management ? Why is reuse considered better in comparison to recycle ? ,"Ans. Since natural resources are limited, if they are over exploited for short term gains, future generation will suffer heavily. Reuse does not consume energy.  (2 marks each) Detailed Answer: Sustainable management is a resource management technique which aims to conserve the resources, use them efficiently and avoid their misuse for individual purpose such that they are conserved for future. Reuse is better than recycle because : (i) Reuse saves energy by using material again without any changes (ii) Reuse prevents environmental pollution. (iii) Reuse saves time as same material is used again. (Any two) 2"
3,Q. 4. What is meant by biodiversity ? List two advantages of conserving forests and wildlife. ,"Ans.

4,Q. 5. How do advantages of exploiting natural resources with short term gains in mind differ from the advantages of managing our resources with a long-term perspective ? ,"Ans. Former leads to huge immediate profits/selfish gains while latter leads to sustainable approach so that the resource may last for future generations too.  Detailed Answer. Exploitation of natural resources with short term gains aims at providing all the benefits to the current generation for their growth and development without any consideration for the future. In case of long term perspective, the resources are utilised in a more judicious manner so that they are also conserved for the future generations. It ensures uniform distribution among the people."
