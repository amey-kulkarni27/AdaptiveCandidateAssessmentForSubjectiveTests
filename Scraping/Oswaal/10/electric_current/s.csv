0,Q. 1. Define electric current. Name the particles that constitute electric current flowing through the metallic wires. ,Ans. 1 volt is the potential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor when 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one point to another. Work done (W) Potential difference = Charge transferred (Q) 100 J =5V 20 C 
1,"Q. 3. State the physical quantity which is equal to the ratio of potential difference and current. Define its SI unit. [Board Term I, Set (44), 2012]","Ans. Electrical Resistance, R = 		The resistance of a conductor is said to be one ohm if the potential difference applied across its ends is 1 volt and a current of 1 A flows through it. It SI unit is ohm (W) 1 volt 1 ohm = 1 ampere  (2 marks each)"
2,"Q. 4. List in a tabular form two differences between a voltmeter and an ammeter. [Board Term I, Set (43), 2012]",Ans. S. No.
3,Q. 5. How the voltmeter and ammeter are connected in a circuit ? ,"Ans. A voltmeter is connected in parallel with device to measure its voltage, while an ammeter is connected in series with a device to measure its current. 1 + 1"
4,"Q. 6. State the factors on which at a given temperature the resistance of a cylindrical conductor depends. State the SI unit of resistivity. [Board Term I, Set (36), 2012]",Ans. Factors on which the resistance of a cylindrical conductor depends : (i) Area of cross-section of the conductor. (ii) Nature of the material. SI unit of resistivity is ohm-m. 
5,"Q. 7. Calculate the resistance of a metal wire of length 2 m and area of cross section 1·55 × 10–6 m2, if the resistivity of the metal be 2·8 × 10–8 Wm ? ",Ans. × 10 -2 = 0·036 W  1
6,"Q. 8. A battery of 12 V is connected to a series combination of resistors 3 W, 4 W, 5 W and 12 W. How much current would flow through the 12 W resistor ? [Board Term I, Set (37), 2012]",Ans. Current remains same in series combination Rseries = R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 (3 + 4 + 5 + 12) = 24W 1 V = 12V I= V 12 V 1 = = 0.5 A R 24 Ω 2 
7,Q. 9. On what factors does resistance of a conductor depend ? ,"Ans. There are four factor that influence the resistance in a conductor. Thickness, length, temperature, conductivity of the material is used."
8,Q. 10. Three incandescent bulbs of 100 W each are connected in series in an electric circuit. In another circuit another set of three bulbs of the same wattage are connected in parallel to the same source. (a) Will the bulb in the two circuits glow with the same brightness? Justify your answer. (b) Now let one bulb the circuits get fused. Will the rest of the bulbs continue to glow in each circuit? Give reason. ,"Ans. (a) No. The resistance of the bulbs in series will be three times the resistance of single bulb. Therefore, the current in the series combination will be onethird compared to current in each bulb in parallel combination. The parallel combination bulbs will glow more brightly. (b) The bulbs in series combination will stop glowing as the circuit is broken and current is zero. However the bulbs in parallel combination shall continue to glow with the same brightness."
9,"Q. 12. Mention the condition under which charges can move in a conductor. Name the device which is used to maintain this condition in an electric circuit. [Board Term I, Set (46), 2012]",Ans. Charges can move if there is a difference of electric pressure or potential difference along the conductor. Electric cell or a battery consisting of two or more cells. 
10,"Q. 13. (i) Calculate the electrical energy consumed by a 1200 W toaster in 30 minute. (ii) What will be the cost of using the same for 1 month if one unit of electricity costs ` 4 ? [Board Term I, Set (37), 2012]",Ans. (i) P = 1200 W t = 30 min = 0.5 h 			 Electrical energy (E) = P × t 				 = 600W/h = 0.6 kWh. (ii)		Energy consumed is 30 days 				= 0.6 × 30 = 18 kWh 			Cost of using 18 units = ` 4 × 18 = ` 72 
11,"Q. 14. Calculate the work done in moving a charge of 2 coulombs across two points having a potential difference of 12 V. [Board Term I, Set (41), 2012]",Ans. q = 2C V = 12V W =V×q 				= 12V × 2C 				= 24 J. 
12,"Q. 15. Draw a schematic circuit diagram for a circuit in which three resistors R1, R2 and R3, a plug key under closed condition, an ammeter are joined in series with a 5V battery. Also a voltmeter is connected to measure the potential difference across the resistor R1. [Board Term I, Set (47), 2012] R1","Ans.
