What does an electric circuit mean ? Name a device that helps to maintain a potential difference across a conductor in a circuit. When do we say that the potential difference across a conductor is 1 volt ? Calculate the amount of work done in shifting a charge of 2 coulombs from a point A to B having potentials 110 V and 25 V respectively. ,"Electric circuit : The closed path along which an electric current flows is called an ‘electric circuit‘. The device that helps to maintain a potential difference across a conductor in a circuit are— Electric cell, electric battery, electric generator 1 Volt : The potential difference between two points in an electric field is said to one volt if one joule of work has to be done in bringing a positive charge of one coulomb from one point to another. 1 joule 1J 1 volt = or 1 V = 1 Coulomb 1C Work done = V  × Q  W =V×Q = 170 Joule.

" Name an instrument that measures electric current in a circuit. Define unit of electric current.  What are the following symbols mean in an electric circuit.    Draw a closed circuit diagram consisting of 0.5 m long nichrome wire XY, an ammeter, a voltmeter, four cells of 1.5 V and a plug key. ", ammeter The current is said to be one ampere if 1 coulomb of charge flows through a cross section of conductor per second.   Rheostat  Plug key   0.5 m 6V  2 + 3 Resistance across A and B :
