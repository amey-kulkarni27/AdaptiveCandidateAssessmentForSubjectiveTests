8,"Q. 9. Write the atomic numbers of two elements ‘X’ and ‘Y’ having electronic configuration 2, 8, 2 and 2, 8, 6 respectively. ",Ans. Atomic number of X = 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 Atomic number of Y = 2 + 8 + 6 = 16
9,"Q. 10. The atomic number of three element X, Y and Z are 3, 11 and 17 respectively. State giving reason which two elements will show similar chemical properties.  ","Ans. X and Y will show similar chemical properties as these have same valence electrons. X = 2, (1) Y = 2, 8, (1)"
10,Q. 11. Name two elements of first period in modern periodic table. ,Ans. Hydrogen and Helium. 
11,"Q. 12. On which side of the periodic table do you find (i) metals, (ii) non-metals ? [Board Term II, Set (2025), 2012]",Ans. Metals are placed on the left side while non-metals are placed on the right side of the periodic table.  ½+½
12,"Q. 13. What is the similarity in the valency of all the elements of group 1 in the modern periodic table ? [Board Term II, Set (2036) 2012]",Ans. Valency is same i.e. 1. 
13,"Q. 14. How does the electronegativity changes as we move from left to right across a period ? [Board Term II, Set (2045) 2012]",Ans. Electronegativity increases across a period. 
14,Q. 15. How does metallic character of a metal depend on the size of atom ?,Ans. The metallic character of a metal increases with increase in the size of its atom.
15,Q. 16. State the similarity in the electronic configuration of all the elements present in group 1 of the periodic table.,Ans. Elements in a group have similar electronic configuration so all of them have 1 valence electron.
16,Q. 17. List any two properties of the elements belonging to the first group of the modern periodic table. ,Ans. First group elements are also known as alkali metals. They possess following properties : (i) These elements exhibit +1 valency. (ii) These are very reactive as they are not found freely in nature.
17,"Q. 18. The atomic numbers of three elements X, Y and Z are 3, 11 and 17, respectively. State giving reason which two elements will show similar chemical properties.",Ans. The two elements X and Y will show same chemical properties because they have same number of valence electrons in group. They form positively charged ions by losing one electron.
