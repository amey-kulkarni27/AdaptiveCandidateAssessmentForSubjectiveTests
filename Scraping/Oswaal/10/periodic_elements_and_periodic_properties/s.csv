How does the size of atomic radius vary on moving left to right in a horizontal row ? Give reason in support of your answer in the above two cases. ,"Ans. Vertical Column — Groups Horizontal Rows — Period Metallic character increases Reason : Ability to lose electrons increases on moving down the group due to increases in distance between the nucleus and the valence electrons/decrease in the attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons. Atomic radius decreases (3 marks each) Reason : The nuclear charge increases on moving from left to right across a period resulting in increase in the attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons.  Detailed Answer : In the modern periodic table, there are 18 vertical columns known as Groups and 7 horizontal rows known as Periods. Metallic character increases on moving down a group in the Modern Periodic table. As we move down the group, the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the outermost electron decreases due to increase in the distance between them. This happens because; on moving down the group a new shell a added. So, the valence electron can be easily lost by the element, thereby metallic character increases on moving down a group. The size of atomic radius decreases on moving left of right in a horizontal row. When, we move across a period, the number of electrons in the same shell increases. This leads to greater electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the outermost electron. This increased attraction pulls the outermost electron closer to the nucleus, thereby decreasing the atomic size."

59,"Q. 44. The position of three elements A, B and C in the periodic table are shown below : Groups → Periods ↓ Give reasons to explain the following : (i) Element ‘A’ is a metal. (ii) Element ‘B’ has larger size than ‘C’. (iii) Element ‘C’ has a valency - 3. ","Ans. (i) Element ‘A’ is a metal because it is present in group I (1 valence electron) and can lose electron easily. (ii) Element B has larger size than ‘C’ because it has more number of shells than ‘C’. Also, B lies in the third period and has three shells whereas B lies in second period and has two shells. (iii) ‘C’ being an element of 3rd group has three valence electrons, therefore its valency is 3. "
60,Q. 45. Write the number of period the modern periodic table has. How do the valency and metallic character of elements vary on moving from left to right in a period ? How do the valency and atomic size of elements vary down a group ? ,"Ans. There are 7 horizontal rows known as periods, that the modern periodic table has. In periods, the number of valence electrons increases from left to right and due to decrease in atomic size, the force of attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus increases. Metallic character decreases along the period due to decrease in tendency to lose electrons. Atomic size generally increases from top to bottom in a group due to the addition of a new shell i.e., number of shells goes on increasing down the group."
