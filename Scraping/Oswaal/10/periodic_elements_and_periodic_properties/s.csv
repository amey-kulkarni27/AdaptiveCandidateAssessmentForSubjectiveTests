"In the Modern Periodic Table how does the metallic trend of the elements change as we move  from left to right in a period, and  down a group ? "," Decreases  Increases  1+1 Detailed Answer :  On moving across a period, nuclear pull increases due to the increases in atomic number and thus the atomic size decreases. Hence, elements cannot lose electrons easily. The metallic nature decreases across a period, moving from left to right.  On moving down a group, the atomic size increases and the nuclear charge also increases. The effect of an increased atomic size is greater as compared to the increased nuclear charge. Therefore, metallic nature increases as one moves down a group."

Write the names given to the vertical columns and horizontal rows in the Modern Periodic Table. How does the metallic character of elements vary on moving down a vertical column ? How does the size of atomic radius vary on moving left to right in a horizontal row ? Give reason in support of your answer in the above two cases. ,"Vertical Column — Groups Horizontal Rows — Period Metallic character increases Reason : Ability to lose electrons increases on moving down the group due to increases in distance between the nucleus and the valence electrons/decrease in the attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons. Atomic radius decreases  Reason : The nuclear charge increases on moving from left to right across a period resulting in increase in the attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons.  Detailed Answer : In the modern periodic table, there are 18 vertical columns known as Groups and 7 horizontal rows known as Periods. Metallic character increases on moving down a group in the Modern Periodic table. As we move down the group, the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the outermost electron decreases due to increase in the distance between them. This happens because; on moving down the group a new shell a added. So, the valence electron can be easily lost by the element, thereby metallic character increases on moving down a group. The size of atomic radius decreases on moving left of right in a horizontal row. When, we move across a period, the number of electrons in the same shell increases. This leads to greater electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the outermost electron. This increased attraction pulls the outermost electron closer to the nucleus, thereby decreasing the atomic size."
