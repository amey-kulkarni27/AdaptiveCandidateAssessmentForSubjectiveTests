Ria and Reena are the students of Class X. Ria is very much organized and maintained whereas Reena is an unorganised student and always faces a lot of problems in handling life situations.  How organization helps in daily life ?  How can you relate the above fact with the chapter ‘Classification of Elements’. How classification of elements help us studying them properly ? ," Organization is all about keeping things in proper order. It plays a significant role in helping us in achieving our goals. It gives us a sense of control and allows for increased productivity.  Classification of elements is based on Organisation of the element in proper manner that helps to make the study of all the elements easier. To make the study of all the elements in the periodic table easy, these elements have been divided into few groups in such a way that elements in the same group have similar properties."
"Atomic size means radius of an atom. Hema, when read this statement understood that it is the distance between centre of nucleus and the outermost shell  of an isolated atom. She also came to know that atomic size generally increases from top to bottom in a group, due to addition of a new shell and decrease along a period from left to right, due to increase in nuclear charge which pulls the electrons towards it.  Hema has to arrange the following elements in an increasing order in a group in accordance of their atomic size Li, Rb, K, Cs, Na.  Atomic number is considered to be a more appropriate parameter than atomic mass for classification of elements in a periodic table. Give any two reasons to justify the statement."," Elements arranged in an increasing order in a group are : Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs.   Although most of the elements were placed in the order of increasing atomic masses, increasing order could not be maintained in all cases.  There was no place for isotopes in Mendeleev’s periodic table, although they differ in atomic mass."
"Some metals react with water and produce metal oxides or hydroxides and liberate hydrogen gas. Metals like sodium and potassium react violently with cold water. However, calcium reacts less violently with cold water because it is less reactive as compared to Na and K. Magnesium does not react with cold water. It reacts with hot water to form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Metals like aluminium, iron and zinc do not react with cold as well as hot water but they react with steam to form metal oxide and hydrogen gas.  Which gas is produced when reactive metal reacts with water ?  How can we extinguish fire ?  Why is sodium kept in Kerosene oil ?  Which metal did not react with water even in the form of steam ?  How can we prevent iron from rust ?"," Hydrogen gas.  By carbon dioxide gas.  Because sodium reacts violently with water and air.  Lead, copper or gold.  By painting iron articles.  3"
