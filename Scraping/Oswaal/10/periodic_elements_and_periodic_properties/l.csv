Examine the elements of the third period and classify them as metals or non-metals. Comment on the metallic and non-metallic character of the third period. Name the most metallic element and non-metallic element of this period.,"Na , Mg  and Al are metals. Si  is a metalloid. P , S  and Cl  are non-metals. As we go from left to right across the third period, metallic character decreases and non-metallic character increases. The most metallic element in the third period is Na and the most non-metallic element is Cl."
"Which element has :  two shells, both of which are completely filled with electrons ?  the electronic configuration, 2, 8, 2.  a total of three shells, with four electrons in its valence shell ?  a total of two shells, with three electrons in its valence shell ?  Twice as many electrons in its second shell as in its first shell ? "," Neon has two shells, both of which are completely filled with electrons .  Magnesium has the electronic configuration, 2, 8,  Silicon has a total of three shells, with four electrons in its valence shell .  Boron has a total of two shells, with three electrons in its valence shell .  Carbon has twice as many electrons in its second shell as in its first shell ."
"An element is placed in 2nd group and 3rd period of the periodic table, burn in presence of oxygen to form a basic oxide :  Identify the element   Write the electronic configuration  Write the balanced equation when it burns in the presence of air.  Write a balanced equation when this oxide is dissolved in water.  Draw the electron dot structure for the formation of this oxide. "," Magnesium.  Electronic configuration is 2, 8, 2  2 Mg +O2 → 2MgO  MgO + H2O → Mg2  Mg → Mg 2+ + 2e– O + 2e– → O2–   is electron dot structure."
"An element X  combines separately with SO42–, PO43– radicals.  Write the formulae of the two compounds so formed.  To which group of the modern periodic table does the element X belong ?  Will it form covalent or ionic compound ? Give reasons."," Formulae of these compounds are XSO4, X32.  It belongs to group 2nd and 3rd period.  It will form ionic compounds as it can lose two electrons to acquire stable electronic configuration. 1"
"Atoms of eight elements A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H have the same number of electronic shells but are different in their outermost shells. It was found that elements A and G combine to form an ionic compound which can also be extracted from sea water. Oxides of the elements A and B are basic in nature while those of E and F are acidic. The oxide of elements D is almost neutral. Answer the following questions based on the information given here in :  To which group or period of the periodic table do the listed elements belong ?  Which one of the eight elements is likely to be a noble gas ?  Which one of the eight elements would have the largest atomic radius ?  Which two elements amongst these are likely to be the non–metals ?  Which one of these eight elements is likely to be a semi–metal or metalloid ? "," A and B belong to group 1 and 2 because they form basic oxides. C belongs to group 13 as it has 3 valence electrons. D belongs to group 14 as it forms almost netural oxide. E and F belong to group 15 and 16 as they form acidic oxides, G belongs to group 17 as it has 7 valence electrons, and H to group 18. They belong to 3rd period of the periodic table.  H belongs to noble gas  A has largest atomic radius  E and F are likely to be non–metals  D is likely to be metalloid or semi–metal."
