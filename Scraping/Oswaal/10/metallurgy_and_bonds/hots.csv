"A non-metal A is an important constituent of our food and forms two oxides B and C. Oxide B is toxic whereas C causes global warming.  Identify A, B and C.  To which group of periodic table does A belong ?  3"," A — Carbon ; B — Carbon monoxide  C — Carbon dioxide .  Carbon  has atomic number 6. Its electronic configuration is 2, 4. It is present in 14th group of the periodic table."
"A metal X left in moist air for a longer time, loses its shiny brown surface and gains a green coat. Why has this happened ? Name and give the chemical formula of this given coloured compound and identify the metal. List two ways to prevent this process.  3","The metal has corroded because of being exposed to moist air. Green compound is basic copper carbonate  The metal is copper. Two ways to prevent this process : Painting, Greasing, Oiling, Galvanizing "
Giving one example of each. Explain the method of obtaining the following metals from their compounds. Metal ‘A’ — Which is low in the activity series. Metal ‘B’ — Which is in the middle in the activity 		series. Metal ‘C’ — Which is towards the top of the 		 activity series.  3, By heating the Ore/Oxide Heat → Hg + SO2 HgS + O2   By heating the oxide in the presence of a reducing agent like coke ZnO + C → Zn + CO  By the electrolysis of molten compound. 2 NaCl → 2Na + Cl2 
"An alkali metal A gives a compound B  on reacting with water. The compound B gives a soluble compound C on treatment with aluminium oxide. Identify A, B and C and give the reactions involved.  3","Let the atomic weight of alkali metal A be x. When it reacts with water, it forms a compound B having molecular mass 40. Let the reaction be. 2A + 2H2O → 2AOH + H2 ↑  According to the question, x + 16 + 1 = 40 x = 40 – 17 x = 23  Therefore, the alkali metal  is Na and the reaction is — 2Na + 2H2O → 2NaOH + H2  So, compound B is sodium hydroxide  Sodium hydroxide reacts with aluminium oxide  to give sodium aluminate . Thus, C is sodium aluminate . The reaction involved is — Al2O3 + 2NaOH → 2NaAlO2 + H2O 1 + 1 + 1"
"P, Q and R are 3 elements which undergo chemical reactions according to the following equations —  P2O3 + 2Q → Q2O3 + 2P  3RSO4 + 2Q → Q2 3 + 3R  3RO + 2P → P2O3 + 3R  Answer the following :  Which element is more reactive ?  Which element is least reactive ?  State the type of reaction listed above.", Most reactive metal is Q as it has replaced both P and R from their compounds.  Element R is least reactive as it has been replaced by both R and Q.  Displacement reaction.
