0,"Q. 1. (a) Define the terms ‘alloy’ and ‘amalgam’. Name the alloy used for welding electric wires together. What are its constituents ? (b) Name the constituents of the following alloys : (i) Brass (ii) Stainless steel (iii) Bronze, State one property in each of these alloys, which is different from its main constituents. (DDE 2017) ","Ans. (a) An alloy is a homogeneous mixture of two or more metals or a metal and a non-metal, mixed in the molten state. Amalgam is an alloy of a metal with mercury. Solder – Lead and tin. (b) (i) Brass – copper and zinc 		(ii) Stainless steel – iron, nickel and chromium 		(iii) Bronze – copper and tin. (5 marks each) Brass and bronze have lower electrical conductivity than their constituents. Stainless steel does not corrode easily as iron does. "
1,"Q. 2. (a) Define the term alloy. Write two advantages of making alloys. (b) A metal ‘X’ which is used in thermite process, when heated with oxygen gives an oxide ‘Y’ which is amphoteric in nature. Identify X and Y. Write down balanced chemical equations of the reactions of oxide Y with HCl and NaOH. ",Ans. (a) Refer to the question No. 1. Advantages : (i) to protect the metal from corrosion. (ii) to improve the quality. (b) X – Al; Y – Al2O3 Al2O3 + 6HCl ¾® 2AlCl3 + 3H2O Al2O3 + 2NaOH ¾® 2NaAlO2 + H2O 2+1+1+1 METALS AND NON-METALS
2,Q. 3. (a) Give reason for the following : 		(i) Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points. 		(ii) Ionic compounds are soluble in water. 		(iii) Ionic compounds conduct electricity in molten state. (b) Show the formation of MgO by transfer of electrons. ,"Ans. (a) (i) Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points. It is because of strong force of attraction between oppositely charged ions, therefore high energy is required to break the metallic bonds between ions. 		(ii) Ionic compounds are soluble in water because they form ions in aqueous solutions. 		(iii) Ionic compounds conduct electricity in molten state and in aqueous solution because ions carry current. The movement of ions takes place towards oppositely charged electrode in electric field. (b) MgO : → Mg2+ + 2e– → O2– O + 2e–  Mg MgO has Mg or MgO and O ions. "
3,"Q. 11. Some metals react with water and produce metal oxides or hydroxides and liberate hydrogen gas. Metals like sodium and potassium react violently with cold water. However, calcium reacts less violently with cold water because it is less reactive as compared to Na and K. Magnesium does not react with cold water. It reacts with hot water to form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Metals like aluminium, iron and zinc do not react with cold as well as hot water but they react with steam to form metal oxide and hydrogen gas. (i) Which gas is produced when reactive metal reacts with water ? METALS AND NON-METALS (ii) How can we extinguish fire ? (iii) Why is sodium kept in kerosene oil ? (iv) Which metal did not react with water even in the presence of steam ? (v) How can we prevent iron from rust ?","Ans. (i) Hydrogen gas. (ii) By carbon dioxide gas. (iii) Because sodium reacts violently with water and air. (iv) Lead, copper or gold. (v) By painting iron articles."
