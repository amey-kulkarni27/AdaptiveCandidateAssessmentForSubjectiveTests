questions,answers
What are minerals ? ,The elements or compounds which occur naturally in the earth’s crust are called minerals.
What is meant by metallurgy ? ,The extraction of metals from their ores and then refining them for use is known as metallurgy.
What is thermite reaction ? ,Reduction of iron oxide to iron by aluminium is called thermite reaction. → 2Fe + Al2O3 + Heat. Fe2O3 + 2Al 
What is the process of depositing Zinc on iron called ? ,Galvanisation.
Aluminium and zinc do not corrode easily even though they are reactive metals. Give reasons for your answer.,Aluminium and zinc react with moist air to form a thin protective layer of oxide on their surfaces. This layer prevents further corrosion of the metals.
"A non-metal X exists in two different forms Y and Z. Y is the hardest natural substance, where as Z is a good conductor of electricity. Identify X, Y and Z.","X is carbon . X exists in the form of allotropes, Y is diamond and Z is Graphite."
A metallic ore ‘X’ reacts with dilute HCl to liberate a gas which turns lime water milky.  Another ore ‘Y’ gives off a gas with the smell of rotten eggs on treatment with the same acid. Which metallurgical processes are used for the extraction of the metals X and Y ?,"X is a carbonate ore since it gives off carbon dioxide on treatment with HCl. So, X is extracted by the process of calcination. Y gives off hydrogen sulphide gas on treatment with dilute HCl. So, it is a sulphide ore which is extracted by roasting."
Why do we apply paint on iron articles ? ,"Paint forms a protective coating on the surface of iron. Then oxygen and moisture present in the air cannot have a direct contact with the metal. Therefore, surface gets protected against rusting. 1"
Why is carbon not used for reducing aluminium from aluminium oxide ? ,"Because aluminium has greater affinity for oxygen than for carbon, therefore carbon cannot reduce alumina  to aluminium."
What happens when ZnCO3 is heated in the absence of air ? Give the relevant equation. ,ZnO and CO2 are formed. ZnCO3 ∆ → ZnO + CO2
