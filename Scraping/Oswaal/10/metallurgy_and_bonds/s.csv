Describe electrolytic refining of copper with chemical equations. Draw a well labelled diagram for it.   (),"Electrolytic Refining : This method is widely used as purification of metals like zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), aluminium (Al), chromium (Cr), tin (Sn), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni) and gold (Au). In this process, impure metal is used as anode, a strip of pure metal is used as cathode and soluble salt of metal is used as electrolyte. On passing electric current through the electrolyte, cations move towards cathode, gain electrons and pure metal gets deposited on cathode. In electrolytic refining of copper, the impurities left behind at anode called anode mud contains valuable metals such as gold and silver which can be recovered in the native state.

"Give reasons : (i) Sodium metal is kept in kerosene oil.  (ii) Platinum, gold and silver are used to make jewellery. (iii) Tarnished copper vessels are cleaned. ","(i) Na, K, Li etc. are very reactive so these metals react vigorously with atmospheric oxygen to form oxides. Storing them in oil prevents their oxidation. (ii) Platinum, gold and silver are least reactive, so they are not corroded by air and water easily.
