What are ionic compounds ? List two properties of these compounds. ,The compounds which have bonds formed by loss and gain of electrons are called ionic compounds or electrovalent compound and the bond formed is known as ionic bond or electrovalent bond.

"Give reasons :  Sodium metal is kept in kerosene oil.   Platinum, gold and silver are used to make jewellery.  Tarnished copper vessels are cleaned. "," Na, K, Li etc. are very reactive so these metals react vigorously with atmospheric oxygen to form oxides. Storing them in oil prevents their oxidation.  Platinum, gold and silver are least reactive, so they are not corroded by air and water easily.
