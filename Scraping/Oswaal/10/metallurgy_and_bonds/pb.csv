"On the basis of sequence of reactions, identify the most and least reactive elements. 				A + BX → AX + B 				C + AY → CY + A",Most reactive : C Least reactive : B
"Iron fillings are put in different test-tubes A, B, C and D containing ZnSO4, CuSO4, Al2(SO4)3, CaCl2 solutions respectively. In which of the following test-tubes change will be observed ? Al2(SO4)3 solution CuSO4 solution ZnSO4 solution CaCl2 solution Iron Fillings",In test-tube B change will be observed because iron is more reactive than copper and it will displace Cu from CuSO4. CuSO4 + Fe → FeSO4 + Cu.
A student performed the following four experiments. HCl FeSO4 CuSO4 AgNO3 Ag Cu Al Au In which experiment no reaction occured ?,"Reaction does not occur in I, II, IV Reason : It occured in (III) because Al is more reactive than Cu, so it will displace Cu from CuSO4. 1 + 1"
What is the theory behind the chemical reaction of zinc with sulphuric acid ?,Zinc metal reacts with dil. sulphuric acid and produces hydrogen gas. Zn(s) + H2SO4(aq) → ZnSO4(aq) + H2(g) This is an example of a single displacement reaction of a non-metal by a metal.
How lime water is prepared ?,Preparation of lime water : Shake 5 g calcium oxide (CaO) with 100 mL water. Allow it to stand for about 24 hours. Decant the supernatant liquid and use it for the tests. It is suggested to always use freshly prepared lime water. 
A piece of granulated Zn was dropped into copper sulphate solution. Write down the colour change that you will observe? Write down the chemical equation.,"Blue solution becomes colourless, reddish brown Cu gets deposited. Zn + CuSO4 → ZnSO4 + Cu"
The solution of copper sulphate fades and finally becomes light green on dipping a rod made up of ________. Explain.,"The solution of copper sulphate fades and finally becomes light green on dipping a rod made up of iron. When an iron nail is dipped in CuSO4 solution, a brown coating of Cu is formed on the surface of iron and the colour of CuSO4 solution changes for blue to light green. This reaction shows that Fe is more reactive than copper as it displaces copper from its solution and green colour FeSO4 solution is formed."
"A student added a piece of zinc metal to four test-tubes I, II, III, IV which respectively contain aqueous solution of aluminium sulphate, zinc sulphate, ferrous sulphate and copper sulphate. In which solution the reaction will take place.",The reaction will take place in solution- III and IV. Zn will react with ferrous sulphate and copper sulphate. Zn + CuSO4 → ZnSO4 + Cu : Zn > Cu Zn + FeSO4 → ZnSO4 + Fe : Zn > Fe
"Aluminium strip was placed in a solution of copper sulphate. After one hour, it was observed that the colour of solution changes. What will be the colour of the solution? Give reason.","Aluminium will displace Cu from copper sulphate solution, so the solution will become colourless."
"A student performed the following displacement reaction: Fe(s) + CuSO4(aq) → FeSO4(aq) + Cu(s) Zn(s) + FeSO4(aq) → ZnSO4(aq) + Fe(s) 2Al(s) + 3ZnSO4(aq) → Al2(SO4)3(aq) + 3Zn(s) Arrange Fe, Zn, Al and Cu in the decreasing order of reactivity on the basis of above reaction.","According to reactivity series, Al > Zn > Fe > Cu"
