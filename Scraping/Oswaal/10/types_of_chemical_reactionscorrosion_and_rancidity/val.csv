Spoilage is the process in which food deteriorates to the point in which it is not edible to humans or its quality of edibility becomes reduced (i) Why does the food get spoiled ? (ii) How the spoilage of food can be prevented ? (iii) How chips are prevented from getting spoiled in packets for so many days?,"(i) When fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell and taste changes. (ii) To prevent spoilage of food, special types of substances called antioxidants are added to fatty foods. (iii) Chips are packed in packets flushed with nitrogen to prevent spoilage by oxidation."
"Atul and Shivam are best friends and study in the same school, grade 5. One day, in the recess, they had taken their lunch together. After the lunch, Shivam felt uncomfortable and had a stomachache. Atul, on observation found that Shivam had eaten spicy junk food in his lunch instead of eating nutritious food. He took Shivam to the infirmary where a teacher gave him a spoon of antacid syrup. Now Shivam felt better and gave thanks to Atul. (i) What problem was Shivam suffering from ? (ii) What happened when Shivam took antacid ? Name the type of reaction. (iii) What values were shown by Atul and Shivam ? 3","(i) Shivam had spicy food, so he was suffering from acidity. (ii) Antacids are alkaline in nature, so when Shivam took a spoon of antacid it neutralized the acid. The type of reaction is Neutralisation reaction. (iii) Friendship, concern for each other, value and balanced diet."

Fill up the gaps left in the following table : Experiment Observation Inference in the type of reaction (i) Quick lime + water (ii) Ferrous sulphate + Heat crystals,"(i) Evolution of steamy vapours/container becomes warm, combination reaction. (ii) Evolution of gases (colourless)/smell like burning sulphur/brown residue left in container, Decomposition reaction."
What is the theory behind the precipitation reaction between aqueous solution of barium chloride with aqueous solution of sodium sulphate ?,"When a solution of sodium sulphate is mixed with a solution of barium chloride, the following double displacement reaction takes place : → BaSO4(s) + 2NaCl(aq) Na2SO4(aq) + BaCl2(aq)  In this reaction, sulphate ions from sodium sulphate are displaced by chloride ions (Cl–) and chloride ions in barium chloride are displaced by sulphate ions. As a result, a white precipitate of barium sulphate is formed and sodium chloride remains in the solution."
What happens when barium chloride solution and sodium sulphate solution are mixed together? Write the chemical equation.,"An insoluble salt is formed, which is barium sulphate and white in colour. BaCl2(aq) + Na2SO4(aq) → BaSO4(s) + 2NaCl(aq) (White ppt.)"
"Solutions of ferrous sulphate, zinc sulphate, copper sulphate and aluminium sulphate were separately taken in four test-tubes and some iron nails were placed in each of the solutions. What will you observe after few seconds?",Iron will react only with CuSO4 solution as Fe is more reactive than Cu.
A student added aluminium pieces in ferrous sulphate solution taken in a test-tube. Write down the colour change she observed in the solution?,Solution becomes pale green to colourless.
Sarthak took two test-tubes A and B containing pale green and blue solutions respectively. Write down the name of the respective solutions taken in test tube A and B?,Solution taken in A is FeSO4 and B is CuSO4.
