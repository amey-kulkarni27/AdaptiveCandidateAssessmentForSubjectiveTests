0,Q. 1. Why is respiration considered as exothermic reaction ? ,Ans. Respiration is considered as exothermic reaction because heat is released along with the formation of products.
1,"Q. 2. Why are decomposing reactions called the opposite of combination reactions ? [Board Term-I Set-23, 2011 (NCERT)]","Ans. In combination reactions, two substances combine to form one compound and in decomposition reactions, a compound breaks down into two or more substances, so they are opposite to each other."
2,Q. 3. Why is photosynthesis endothermic reaction ? considered an ,Ans. Because heat is absorbed in this process. (1 mark each)
3,Q. 4. Why we store silver chloride in dark coloured bottles ? ,Ans. Dark coloured bottles interrupt the path of light such that light cannot reach silver chloride in the bottles and its decomposition is prevented.
4,Q. 5. State the type of chemical reaction used for the extraction of metals from their naturally occurring chlorides or oxides. ,Ans. Electrolytic reduction.
5,"Q. 6. Why is hydrogen peroxide kept in coloured bottles ? [Board Term-I Set-36, Set (A1), 2011, 2010]","Ans. Hydrogen peroxide decomposes into H2O and O2 in the presence of sunlight and hence to prevent decomposition, they are kept in coloured bottles. 2H2O2 Sunlight → 2H2O + O2"
6,Q. 7. Why do Copper vessel lose shine when exposed to air ? ,Ans. When Copper vessel is exposed to air it losses it shine due to corrosion because a green coating is deposited on Copper.
7,Q. 8. A shiny brown coloured element ‘X’ on heating in air becomes black in colour. Name the element ‘X’ and the black coloured compound formed. ,Ans. Element ‘X’ is Copper and the black coloured compound is Cupric oxide Cu2O.
8,"Q. 9. N2 + 3H2  → 2NH3, name the type of reaction. ",Ans. It is a combination reaction.
9,Q. 10. Why do silver articles become black after sometime when exposed to air ? ,Ans. They get tarnished by reacting with atmospheric air to form silver sulphide.
10,"Q. 11. Give reasons why do chips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as nitrogen ? [Board Term-I Set (12), 2011] ",Ans. To prevent the oil and fats of the chips from being oxidized or become rancid.
11,Q. 12. Identify the reducing agent in the following reaction : → 2Fe + 3CO2 Fe2O3 + 3CO  ,"Ans. CO i.e., carbon monoxide is the reducing agent in the given reaction, as it removes oxygen from Fe2O3 and causes its reduction."
12,Q. 15. Write a chemical equation of double displacement reaction.  ,Ans. Double displacement Reaction— Na2SO4 (aq) + BaCl2(aq) → BaSO4(s) + 2NaCl (aq)
13,Q. 16. What happens when milk is left open at room temperature during summers ? ,Ans. When milk is left open at room temperature during Summers it gets oxidised become rancid and it smell and taste changes.
14,"Q. 17. What changes do you observe in the iron nails and colour of copper sulphate solution, if iron nails are dipped in CuSO4 solution for 15 minutes ? ","Ans. The Iron nail become brownish in colour and the blue colour of Copper sulphate solution fade, because Iron has displaced or removed another element, copper form Copper sulphate solution. 1"
