"(i) Define corrosion. (ii) What is corrosion of iron called ? (iii) How will you recognise the corrosion of silver ? (iv) Why corrosion of iron is a serious problem ? (v) How can we prevent corrosion of iron ?   (i) Define corrosion, what name is given to the corrosion of iron ? () (ii) Name the colour of coating formed on silver and copper articles, when exposed to air ? (iii) List two damages caused by corrosion and suggest how corrosion can be prevented. ","(i) Correct definition. (ii) rusting. (iii) Silver - black, copper - green. (iv) Destruction of Car bodies, bridges, railing, etc (Any two) (v) Painting, alloying, greasing etc (Any two)  5 Detailed Answer : (i) Corrosion is a process in which metals, are deteriorated by action of air, moisture, chemicals etc. (iii) Corrosion of iron is called Rusting. (iii) Silver turns black as it reacts with H2S present in air and form a layer of Ag2S. (iv) Corrosion of iron is a serious problem because it leads to wastage of tonnes of iron every year and lot of money is spent to repair or replace it. (v) The iron articles should be painted."
(a) Explain the term ‘’rancidity.’’ Name the type of chemical reaction responsible for causing rancidity and define it. (b) Write three methods for preventing rancidity of food. ,"(a) When fats and oils are oxidised, the food becomes rancid i.e., their smell and taste changes. The type of chemical reaction is oxidation. Definition : Rancidity is the process of slow oxidation of oil and fat present in the food materials resulting in the production of foul odour and taste in them. (b) Methods to prevent Rancidity : (i) Refrigeration of cooked food at low temperatures. (ii) Packing of food materials in air tight containers. (iii) By adding antioxidants e.g., BHA (Butylated hydroxyanisole)"
(a) Most of the metals acquire a dull surface when exposed to air. Name the chemical phenomenon responsible for this process. (b) State the conditions under which the iron articles get rusted. Design an activity to investigate the conditions necessary for rusting. Suggest any two methods to prevent rusting of iron. ,"(a) Corrosion. (b) Conditions are – air and moisture. Activity : Take three test-tubes. Place clean iron nails in each test-tube. (i) Pour some water in test-tube 1, cork it. (ii) Pour water (boiled/distilled) in test-tube 2, add some oil and cork it. (iii) Put some anhydrous calcium chloride in test-tube 3 and cork it. (iv) After 2-3 days, we observe that the nails in test-tube 1 get rusted because they are exposed to air and water both, while nail in test-tube 2 and 3 do not get rusted. This shows rusting of iron takes place in the presence of air and moisture, both. Methods to prevent rusting : Alloying, galvanization, painting, lubrication (Any two)."
"(a) Write one equation each for decomposition reaction when energy is supplied in the form of : (i) heat, (ii) light. (b) Account for the following :  (i) Paint is applied on iron articles. 		(ii) Oil and fat containing food items are flushed with nitrogen. 		(iii) When an iron nails kept in copper sulphate solution, blue colour of the solution fades and iron nails becomes brownish. [Board Term-I Set (C1), 2010]","(a) (i) CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g) (ii) 2AgBr Sunlight → 2Ag + Br2 (b) (i) To protect the iron articles from corrosion. When iron articles are exposed to moist air, corrosion takes place. When the surface is covered by paint, it is not exposed to moist air. 		(ii) To flush out any air or oxygen present in the packet. In the absence of oxygen, food items will not get rancid. 		(iii) Since iron is more reactive than copper, it displaces copper from copper sulphate solution and the blue colour of solution fades. Due to the deposition of copper on iron nail, iron nail become brownish."
"(i) Account for the following : 		(a) White silver chloride turns grey in sunlight. 		(b) Brown coloured copper powder on heating in air turns into black coloured substance. (ii) What do you mean by :  		(a) Displacement reaction 		(b) Reduction reaction 		(c) Combination reaction ? Write balanced chemical equation. [Board Term-I Set (C2), 2010]","(i) (a) Due to the decomposition of silver chloride into silver and chlorine by sunlight Sunlight 			 2AgCl → 2Ag + Cl2 		(b) Due to the oxidation of copper powder to copper oxide, brown colour turns into black 1 → 2CuO(s) 			 2Cu(s) + O2(g)  (ii) (a) A chemical reaction in which the more reactive element displaces the less reactive element from its compound is called displacement reaction. → ZnSO4(aq) + Cu(s) 1 			 CuSO4(aq) + Zn(s)  		(b) A chemical reaction in which hydrogen is added or oxygen is removed is called reduction reaction. → Zn + CO 			 ZnO + C  		(c) Combination reaction is a reaction in which two or more than two substances combine and form a single substance. → Ca(OH)2 + Heat 			 CaO + H2O  "
"(i) Solid calcium oxide was taken in a container and water was added slowly to it : (a) Write the observation, (b) Write the chemical formula of the product formed. (ii) What happens when carbon dioxide gas is bubbled through lime water : (a) In small amount, 		(b) In excess ? (iii) Why do you apply paint on iron articles ? [Board Term-I Set (C2), 2010]","(i) (a) Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with water and releases a large amount of heat. 		(b) Calcium hydroxide (Slaked lime) i.e., Ca(OH)2 is formed. (ii) (a) In small amount, solution becomes milky due to the formation of calcium carbonate. Or → CaCO3 + H2O. Ca(OH)2 + CO2  		(b) In excess Milkiness disappears because calcium carbonate changes to calcium hydrogen carbonate which is colourless in nature. → Ca(HCO3)2 CaCO3 + H2O + CO2  Colourless (iii) Paint forms a protective coating on the surface of iron. So that oxygen and moisture present in the air cannot have a direct contact with iron. "
"(i) What happens chemically when quick lime is added to water ? (ii) Balance the following chemical equation → MnCl2 + Cl2 + H2O MnO2 + HCl  (iii) What is decomposition reaction ? Explain it with suitable example. [Board Term-I Set (C1), 2010] ",(i) Quick lime reacts with water vigorously to produce slaked lime releasing a large amount of heat. → Ca(OH)2(aq) CaO(s) + H2O(l)  (Quick lime) (Slaked lime) → MnCl2 + 2H2O + Cl2 (ii) MnO2 + 4HCl  (iii) A simple reactant breaks down to give simpler products and the process is known as decomposition reaction. Example : CaCO3(s) Heat CaO(s) + CO2(g) (Quick lime)
