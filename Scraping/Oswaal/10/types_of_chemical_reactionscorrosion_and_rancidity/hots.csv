Why do fire flies glow at night ? ,"Fire flies have a special kind of substances i.e., luciferin that undergoes oxidation (in the presence of air) in the presence of an enzyme. This reaction is accompanied by the emission of light. Therefore, fire flies glow at night."
Grapes hanging on the plant do not ferment but after being plucked from the plant can be fermented. Under what conditions do these grapes ferment ? Is it a chemical change ? ,"Grapes when attached to the plants are living and therefore their own immune system presents fermentation. The microbes can grow in the plucked grapes and under anaerobic conditions, these can be fermented."
"A metal ‘x’ available in the form of ribbons burn in air with a dazzling white light, once heated to its ignition temperature. It leaves a white powder ‘y’ which dissolves in water. The solution so formed turns red litmus blue. Identify ‘x’ and ‘y’ and write the balanced chemical equation of the reaction. 3","Magnesium ribbon burns with dazzling white light, once heated to its ignition temperature. The white powder formed is Magnesium oxide which dissolves in water to give a basic solution which turns red litmus blue. Thus ‘x’ is Mg and ‘y’ is MgO. 2Mg + O2 → 2MgO MgO + H2O → Mg(OH)2"
Identify the type of chemical reaction and also write the chemical equation for the reaction that takes place when a solution of potassium chloride is mixed with silver nitrate solation. Write the chemical name of one of the products obtained. 3,AgNO3(aq) + KCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + KNO3(aq) 1½ It is a double displacement reaction. Silver chloride / Potassium nitrate.
A solution of substance ‘X’ is used for white washing : (i) Name the substance ‘X’ and write its formula. (ii) Express the reaction of ‘X’ with water in the form of a balanced chemical equation.,"(i) X → Quick lime, formula — CaO (ii) CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2"
"A compound ‘X’ is a constituent of baking powder. It is used as an antacid. When ‘X’ is heated it gives out a gas ‘Y’ which when passed through lime water turns it milky and a salt ‘Z’ is formed which is the main constituent of washing power. Identify X, Y and Z. Write balanced chemical equations for the reactions involved. ","Baking powder (NaHCO3) salt X is commonly used in bakery products. On heating, it forms sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), Y and CO2 gas, Z is evolved. When CO2 gas, Z is passed through lime water, it forms calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which is slightly soluble in water making it milky. X - NaHCO3 ; Y - Na2CO3 ; Z - CO2 Heat → Na2CO3 + H2O + CO2 2 NaHCO3  Heat → Na2CO3 + 10H2O Na2CO3·10H2O "
(i) A solution of a substance ‘X’ is used for testing carbon dioxide. Write the equation of the reaction of ‘X’ with carbon dioxide. (ii) How is X obtained ? Write chemical equation.,(i) Substance X is lime water. 		Ca(OH)2 + CO2 → CaCO3 (Lime water) (Carbon dioxide) + H2O (Calcium (Water) carbonate) (ii) Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to produce slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) releasing a large amount of heat. CaO(s) + H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2(aq) (Quick lime) (slaked lime)
Give reasons for the following : (i) All decomposition reactions are endothermic reactions. (ii) Colour of copper sulphate solution changes when an iron nail is dipped in it. (iii) Respiration is an exothermic reaction.,"(i) Decomposition reactions require energy either in the form of heat, light or electricity for breaking down the reactants. So energy is absorbed and are endothermic in nature. (ii) Iron has displaced copper from copper sulphate solution to form iron sulphate which is light green in colour because Fe is more reactive than copper. (iii) During digestion, food containing carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose. This glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides energy. Since energy is given, so it is exothermic. "
"A brown substance ‘X’ on heating in air forms a substance ‘Y’. When hydrogen gas is passed over heated ‘Y’, it again changes back into X. (i) Name the substances ‘X’ and ‘Y’ (ii) Name the chemical process occurring during both the changes. (iii) Write the chemical equations involved in both the changes. [Board Term-I Set (40), 2012] 3","(i) ‘X’ is Copper (Cu), ‘Y’ is Copper oxide (CuO) 1 (ii) Oxidation and Reduction Heat → 2CuO (iii) 2Cu + O2  Heat → Cu + H2O CuO + H2  "
