What is meant by magnetic field ?  ,The region surrounding a magnet in which the force of the magnet can be detected is said to be its magnetic field. 
Define magnetic field of bar magnet. ,Magnetic field around the bar magnet is the region in which magnetic force due to bar magnet can be experienced.
What is the direction of the magnetic field lines inside a bar magnet ? ,Inside a bar magnet is South to North.
What is the direction of the magnetic field lines outside a bar magnet ? ,Outside a bar magnet is North to South.
Define the term ‘induced current’. ,It is the electric current which originates in a conductor by use of fluctuating magnetic field around the conductor.
Why are magnetic field lines more crowded towards the pole of a magnet ?  ,This indicates that the magnetic field in that region is strong. 
Why does a compass needle show deflection when brought near a current carrying conductor ? ,Due to production of magnetic field around the current carrying conductor. 
Why does two magnetic field lines not intersect ? ,"Magnetic field lines never intersect because for intersection there must be two north directions at a point, which is not possible."
"When a current carrying conductor is kept in a magnetic field, state the position when maximum force acts on it. ",The force experienced by a current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field is the maximum when conductor is kept perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field.
List two sources of magnetic fields. ,"Magnet, moving charges, electric current.  ½+½ "
State the effect of a magnetic field on the path of a moving charged particle. ,It can deflect the path of the charged particle. 
State the observation made by Oersted on the basis of his experiment with current carrying conductors. ,The strength of the magnetic field increases. 
State the conclusions that can be drawn from the observation that a current carrying wire deflects a magnetic needle placed near it. ,A magnetic field exists around it. 
Meena draws magnetic field lines of field close to axis of a current carrying circular loop. As she moves away from the centre of the circular loop she observes that the lines keep on diverging. How will you explain her observation. ,Strength of the magnetic field falls as distance increases. This is indicated by the decrease in degree of closeness of the lines of field.
Name the physical quantities which are indicated by the direction of thumb and forefinger in the Fleming’s right hand rule. ,Direction of motion of the conductor and direction of field.  1
The magnetic field in a given region is uniform. Draw a diagram to represent it. ,The angle between current carrying conductor and magnetic field is 90°. 
"How will the magnetic field intensity at the centre of a circular coil carrying current change, if the current through the coil is doubled and the radius of the coil is halved ? , when current I is doubled and radius R is halved, the magnetic field becomes four times the original field.","Magnetic field at centre of a coil, B ∝"
Suggest one way of discriminating a wire carrying current from a wire carrying no current. ,"Bring a magnetic needle near the wire, a current carrying wire will produce a deflection in the needle whereas a wire without a current will not. 1 "
A straight wire carrying electric current is moving out of plane of paper and is perpendicular to it. What is the direction and type of induced magnetic field ?,Induced magnetic field will be in the form of concentric circles in the plane of paper.
How can it be shown that magnetic field exists around a wire carrying current ?,"By using magnetic compass, that shows deflection.1 Uniform magnetic field inside a solenoid. "
