Why is roof top water harvesting important in Rajasthan ? Explain. ,"Roof top water harvesting is important in Rajasthan because :  It was commonly practised to store drinking water.  The rainwater can be stored in the tankas till the next rainfall making it an extremely reliable source of drinking water when all other sources are dried up, particularly in the summers.  Rain water, or palar pani, as commonly referred to in these parts, is considered the purest form of natural water.  Many houses construct underground rooms adjoing the ‘tanka’ to beat the summer heat as it would keep the room cool.  Some houses still maintain the tanks since they do not like the taste of top water."
Why are different water harvesting systems considered a viable alternative both socioeconomically and environmentally in a country like India ?,"Ans.		 Keeping into view the disadvantages and rising resistance against the multi-purpose projects, water harvesting system is considered a viable alternative both socio-economically and environmentally.  In ancient India also alongwith the sophisticated hydraulic structures there existed an extraordinary tradition of various water harvesting systems.  People adopted different techniques in different areas. In hilly regions people built diversion channels like the 'guls' or 'kuls' for agriculture.   Roof-top rain water harvesting was commonly practised to store drinking water, particularly in Rajasthan.  In the flood plains of Bengal, people developed inundation channels to irrigate their fields. Khadins, Johads and Tanks are the forms of rain water harvesting practised in Rajasthan.  1¼×4=5"
Describe any four traditional methods of rain water harvesting adopted in different parts of India. ,"Ans.		 Methods of rain water harvesting used in India are :  Guls and Kuls : People built guls and kuls in hilly and mountainous regions to divert water. These are simple channels. They are mainly used in Western Himalayas.  Roof top rain water harvesting : Commonly practised to store drinking water in Rajasthan.  Inundation Channels : These channels developed in the flood plains of Bengal to irrigate fields.  Khadins and Johads : In arid and semi-arid regions, some agricultural fields were converted into rain fed storage structures. These structures are found in Rajasthan.  Tanks : In Bikaner, Phalodi and Barmer, almost all houses have tanks for storing drinking water. Tanks are part of the well-developed roof top rain water harvesting system.  5 ¾¾ Types of farming ; major crops ; cropping pattern ; technological and institutional reforms ; their impact ; contribution of agriculture to national economy—employment and output. zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz Since agriculture is an age-old economic activity in India, farming varies from subsistence to commercial type. At TOPIC - 1 present, in different parts of India, the following farming Types of Farming, Cropping Pattern systems are practised : and Major Crops .... P. 88  Primitive subsistence farming : It depends upon TOPIC - 2 monsoon, natural fertility of the soil and suitability of Technological and Institutional other environmental conditions to the crops grown. Reforms .... P. 91  Intensive subsistence farming : It is done where high doses of biochemical inputs and irrigation are used for obtaining higher production.  Commercial farming : In this type of farming, the main thing is the use of higher doses of modern inputs e.g., high yielding variety  seeds, chemical fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides in order to obtain higher productivity. The three cropping seasons of India are : Rabi, Kharif and Zaid. Rabi crops are sown in winter from October to December and harvested in summer from April to June. Kharif crops are grown with the onset of monsoon in different parts of the country and these are harvested in September to October. Between the Rabi and the Kharif seasons, there is a short season during the summer, known as the Zaid season. Major crops grown in India are rice, wheat, millets, pulses, tea, coffee, sugarcane, oilseeds, cotton, and jute. Horticulture crops : India is the largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the world. India is a producer of tropical as well as temperate fruits. India produces about 13 percent of the world’s vegetables. It is an important producer of pea, cauliflower, onion, cabbage, tomato, brinjal and potato. The non-food crops grown in India are rubber, fibre crops, cotton, jute, etc. Rearing of silk worms for the production of silk fibre is known as sericulture. Agriculture, which provides livelihood for more than 60 percent of its population, needs some serious technical and institutional reforms. Thus, collectivisation, consolidation of holdings and abolition of Zamindari etc. were given priority to bring about institutional reforms. India’s food security policy has a primary objective to ensure availability of food grains to the common people at an affordable price. It has enabled the poor to have access to the food. The green revolution promised improvement in the condition of marginal and small farmers. Genetic engineering is recognised as a powerful supplement in inventing new hybrid varieties of seeds. zz zz zz zz Agriculture : The science and art of cultivating soil, raising crops and rearing animals. Primitive Subsistence Farming : Farming on small patch of land with the help of primitive tools such as hoe, dao and digging sticks and family or community labour. Intensive Subsistence Farming : Increase in the agricultural production by using scientific methods and better agricultural inputs. Plantation Farming : In this type of farming, a single crop is grown on a large area. zzCommercial Farming : Farming in which the farmer grows the crops with the sole aim of selling the produce for commercial purpose. zzSericulture : Rearing of silk worms for the production of silk. zzHorticulture : Intensive cultivation of vegetables, fruits and flower crops. zzJhumming : Burning a piece of land for cultivation by a forest tribes. zzThe Green Revolution : Technologies that were introduced to increase the agricultural production such as use of HYV of seeds, fertilizers, modern machinery and inputs. zzWhite Revolution : Also called ‘Operation Flood’ technology that was introduced to increase milk production. zzBloodless Revolution : Bhoodan and Gramdan Movement initiated by Vinoba Bhave in 1951 is known as the Bloodless Revloution. zzRabi : Crops are grown at the beginning of winters and harvested at the beginning of summers. zzKharif : Crops are grown with the onset of monsoon and harvested at the beginning of winters. zzZaid : A short cropping season in between the Rabi and the Kharif seasons used for growing vegetables and fodder crops. zzMillets : Jowar, Bajra and Ragi are called millets. These are known as coarse grains. zzCrop Rotation : Growing of different crops in succession on the same field from season to season to maintain soil fertility. zzIrrigation : An artificial means of watering the standing crops is called irrigation. zzICAR : Indian Council of Agriculture Research. zzFCI : Food Corporation of India. zzOrganic Farming : Farming which is practised without factory made chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides. zzMinimum Support Price  : A minimum guaranteed price of a crop, fixed and announced by the government before the start of a cropping season. zzKissan Credit Card  : This is a credit card to provide affordable credit for farmers in India. 1.
