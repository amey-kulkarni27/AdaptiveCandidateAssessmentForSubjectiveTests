Resources must be used in such a way that something is conserved for future generations.  The standard of living of all people must be raised. Measures to ensure sustainable development :  We should focus on using renewable resources and keep inventing new techniques to decrease the use of conventional resources.

Features :  It is linked to sustainability since it has to be maintained for future generations.  Resources are need to be used wisely so that they can be replenished. For example, if trees are cut they should also be re-planted and allowed to grow.  Overuse of resources which exhaust them. For example, petroleum. If it is used indiscriminately, it will soon get finished and future generations will have nothing left in their hands.  If development is not sustainable, it will give rise to environmental degradation and become a global problem.

‘The earth has enough resources to meet the needs of all but not enough to satisfy the greed of even one person’. How is this statement relevant to the discussion of development ? Explain.  ,"This statement is given by Mahatma Gandhi :  It means that the earth has abundant resources to satisfy everyone’s needs but in our greed and hurry to develop, we have been recklessly exploiting these resources.  In the name of development, we have indulged in activities such as deforestation, overgrazing, encroachment into forest lands, overuse of ground water, use of plastics, etc.  The exploitation of natural resources not only harms the environment but may cripple the future generations of the development process itself.  If fossil fuels are exhausted, the development of all countries would be at risk.  Thus, there is a need for conservation and judicious use of resources for development.  "
