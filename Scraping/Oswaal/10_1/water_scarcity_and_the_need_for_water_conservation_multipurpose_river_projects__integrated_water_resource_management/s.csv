How have intensive industrialization and urbanization posed a great pressure on existing fresh water resources in India. Explain.  Or 		 How does urbanization and urban lifestyle lead to over exploitation of water resources ? Explain.  Or How have intensive industrialization and urbanization posed a great pressure on existing fresh water resources in India ? Explain. ,"Ans.		Post independent India witnessed intensive industrialisation and urbanisation.  Arrival of MNC’s : Apart from fresh water they require electricity which comes from hydroelectric power.  Multiplying urban centers with large and dense populations and urban life styles have not only added to water and energy requirements but have further aggravated the problem.  Large-scale migration from rural to urban areas is causing over exploitation of water resources.     the soil of the downstream region does not get nutrient rich silt. Dams also fragment rivers making it difficult for aquatic fauna to migrate for spawning, i.e., to produce eggs. It resulted in displacement of local communities. The local people often have to give up their land and livelihood and their meagre access and control over resources for the greater need of the nation. "

List any three advantages and three disadvantages of Multipurpose River Project.  Or 		What are the advantages and disadvantages of multipurpose river project.  ,"Ans.		 Advantages :  These are the main source of power generation.  They provide us neat, pollution free and cheapest energy which is the backbone of industry and agriculture.  These projects control the floods because water can be stored in them. These projects have converted many, ‘rivers of sorrows’ into ‘rivers of boon’.  These projects are the main source of irrigation and also help in conserving soil. Disadvantages :  Due to the construction of dams, there are no adequate floods in the river. Because of this,"
Why is groundwater a highly overused resource ? ,"Groundwater is a highly overused resource because of the following reasons :  Due to large and growing population and consequent greater demands for water and unequal access to it.  To facilitate higher food grain production for large population, water resources are being over exploited to expand irrigated areas and dry season agriculture.  In the housing societies or colonies in the cities, there is an arrangement of own ground water pumping devices to meet water needs."
