Explain any three reasons responsible for water scarcity in India ?  Or 		 Water is available in abundance in India even then scarcity of water is experienced in major parts of the country. Explain it with four examples. ," The availability of water resources varies over space and time, mainly due to the variations in seasonal and annual precipitation.  Over-exploitation, excessive use and unequal access to water among different social groups.  Water scarcity may be an outcome of large and growing population and consequent greater demands for water. A large population means more water to produce more food. Hence, to facilitate higher food-grain production, water resources are being over exploited to expand irrigated areas for dry-season agriculture.  Most farmers have their own wells and tubewells in their farms for irrigation to increase their production. But it may lead to falling groundwater levels, adversely affecting water availability and food security of the people. Thus, inspite of abundant water there is water scarcity.  1¼×4=5"
