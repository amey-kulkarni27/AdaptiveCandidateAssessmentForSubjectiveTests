Why do we need to conserve our forests and wildlife ? Explain any two steps taken by the government to protect forests and wildlife resources. ," We need to conserve our forests and wildlife because :  Conservation preserves the ecological diversity and our life support system : air, water and soil.  Conservation also preserves the genetic diversity of plants and animals for better growth of species and breeding.  It makes the planet Earth safe.  Steps taken by the government to protect forests and wild life resources :  The Indian Wildlife Protection Act was implemented in 1972 with various provisions for protecting habitats.  Central and many state governments have established national parks and wildlife sanctuaries."
Describe any five different types of species of flora and fauna as per the classification given by IUCN. ,"They can be classified in the following ways :  Normal Species : Species whose population is normal for their survival. For example : Cattle, sal, pine, rodents, etc.  Endangered Species : These are species which are in danger of extinction. For example : Black buck, crocodile, sangai etc.  Vulnerable Species : These are species whose population has decreased over a period of time and danger of extinction. For example : blue sheep, Asiatic elephant, etc.  Rare Species : Species which are small in number and in danger of extinction if not been taken care of. For example : brown bear, desert fox, hornbill, etc.  Endemic Species : These are species which are only found in some particular areas usually isolated by natural or geographical barriers. For example : Andaman teal, mithun, etc.  Extinct Species : These species have vanished from a local area, region, country, continent or the entire earth. For example : Asiatic Cheetah, pink head duck, etc.  "
‘Nature - worship is an old age belief’. Explain how has it helped in the conservation of forests and wild life. ,"It has helped in the conservation of forests and wildlife in the following ways :  Such beliefs have preserved several virgin forests in pristine form called Sacred Groves. These parts of large forests have been left untouched by local people.  Certain societies like the Mundas and the Santhals revere a particular tree which they have preserved since time immemorial. 3-  To many of us, Peepal and Banyan trees are considered sacred.  Sacred qualities are often ascribed to springs, mountain peaks, plants and animals which are closely protected.  One can find troops of macaques and langurs around many temples. They are fed daily and are treated as a part of temple devotees."
‘’Forests play a key role in the ecological system.’’ Highlight the values of forest in our life.  Or 		Explain three reasons why we need to save the biodiversity of our planet ? ,"Ans.		 We need to save the biodiversity of our planet because :  Human beings alongwith all living organisms form a complex web of ecological system in which they are only a part and are very much dependent on this system for their existence.  The plants, animals and micro-organisms recreate the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the soil that produces our food without which we cannot survive.  Forests play a key role in the ecological system as these are also the primary producers on which all other living beings depend.  "
Mention any four major threats to the population of tiger ? Explain the efforts made by the government to protect them.  Or 		Write a brief note on ‘Project Tiger’. ,"Tiger is one of the key wildlife species in the faunal web. In 1973, the authorities felt that the tiger population had dwindled to 1,827 from an estimated 55,000 at the turn of the century. Major threats to tigers are poaching for trade, shrinking habitat, depletion of prey based species, growing human population, etc. ‘Project Tiger’ is one of the well-publicised wildlife campaigns in the world that was launched in 1973. In 1993, the population of tiger had dropped to 3,600. There are 39 tiger reserves in India. Corbett National Park in Uttaranchal, Sunderbans National Park in West Bengal, Bandhavgarh National Park in Madhya Pradesh, Sariska Wildlife Sanctuary in Rajasthan, Manas Tiger Reserve in Assam and Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala are some of the tiger reserves of India.  3 ¾¾ Sources ; distribution; utilization ; multipurpose projects ; water scarcity ; need for conservation and management; rainwater harvesting . 3/4th of the earth’s surface is covered with water, but TOPIC - 1 fresh water accounts for a small proportion. Fresh water Water Scarcity and the need for water is mainly obtained from surface run off and ground water conservation; Multipurpose river which is continually renewed and recharged through the projects & Integrated Water Resource hydrological cycle. Management .... P. 82 zz Water scarcity : Due to variations in seasonal and annual precipitation, the availability of water varies over place and TOPIC - 2 time. Water scarcity is mainly caused due to the excessive use Rainwater Harvesting .... P. 84 and unequal access to water for different social groups. zz An area having ample water resources can have to face water scarcity due to the following reasons :  Greater demand for water by large and growing population and unequal access to it.  Water resources are being over-exploited to expand agriculture and consequently ground water levels are falling.  Post independent India has witnessed intense industrialisation and urbanisation, exerting increasing pressure on fresh water resources.  Multiplying urban centers with large and dense populations have further aggravated the problem of water scarcity. zz In housing societies or colonies, most of the houses have their own ground water pumping devices to meet the water needs. Thus, water resources are being overexploited. Multi-purpose River Projects and Integrated Water Resource Management : zz The history reveals use of many sophisticated hydraulic structures from ancient times, such as dams of stone, reservoirs or lakes, embankments and canals for irrigation. zz Some ancient hydraulic structures are listed below :  Sringaverapura near Allahabad had a sophisticated water harvesting system, which channelised the flood water of Ganga river. It dates back to 1st century B.C.  There are many extensively built dams, lakes and irrigation systems. The most important lake is Sudarshan lake.  Bhopal lake is one of the largest artificial lakes built in the 11th century A.D.  In the 14th century, the tank in Hauz Khas, Delhi was constructed by Iltutmish for supplying water to the Siri Fort area. zz Uses of dams :  Irrigation.		  Electricity generation.  Water supply for domestic and industrial uses.		  Flood control.  Recreation.		  Inland navigation.  Fish breeding. zz Thus, dams are now referred to as multipurpose projects. zz J.L. Nehru proudly proclaimed dams as the temples of modern India because of their potential to integrate development of agriculture and the village economy with rapid industrialisation and growth of the urban economy. zz Reasons for opposing multi-purpose projects :  Poor sediment flow.  Excessive sedimentation at the bottom of the reservoir. zz  Poorer habitats for the rivers’ aquatic life.  Difficult for aquatic fauna to migrate.  Submerge the existing vegetation and soil leading to its decomposition over a period of time. zzRain water harvesting : Rain water harvesting system was a viable alternative of multipurpose projects both socioeconomically and environmentally. Roof-top rain water harvesting was commonly practised in Rajasthan to store drinking water. zzIn arid and semi-arid regions of Rajasthan, almost all houses traditionally had underground tanks for storing drinking water. zzRain water is also referred to as palar pani and it is considered as the purest form of natural water. zzRoof-top rain water harvesting is the most common practice in Shillong in Meghalaya. zzTamil Nadu is the first and the only state in India which has made roof-top rain water harvesting structures compulsory. There are legal provisions to punish the defaulters. zzHydrological Cycle : This is the journey that water takes as it circulates from the land to the sky and back again. It is also known as the ‘water cycle’. zzFresh Water : Water not from the sea and is not salty or brackish. zzGround Water : The water which exists below the ground surface is the zone of saturation and can be extracted through well or any other means or emerges as springs and base flows in streams and rivers. zzHydraulic Structure : All dams, lakes, canals, wells and ponds etc. in which rainwater is collected. zzHydroelectricity : It is the power which is generated with the help of running water. zzDam : A dam is a barrier across flowing water that obstructs, directs or retards the flow, often creating a reservoir, lake or impoundment. zzMultipurpose Project : A multi-purpose project or river valley project serves a number of purposes simultaneously such as irrigation, flood control, generating hydroelectricity and tourism, e.g., the Bhakra Nangal Dam. zzRain Water Harvesting : Rainwater harvesting is gathering, accumulating and storing rainwater for different uses. zzAquifer : A layer of rock or soil which can absorb and hold water. zzWater Scarcity : Shortage of water as compared to its demand is known as water scarcity. zzGuls or Kuls : In hilly and mountainous regions, people build diversion channels like the ‘Guls’ or ‘Kuls’ of Western Himalayas for agriculture. zzInundation Canal : It is meant to direct flood waters during the rainy season. zzDrip Irrigation : It is a type of irrigation in which water gets dropped in the form of drips close to roots of the plants in order to conserve the moisture. zzSurface Runoff : This is the water flow that occurs when the soil is infiltrated to full capacity and excess water from rain, melted snow or other sources flows over the land. 1.
