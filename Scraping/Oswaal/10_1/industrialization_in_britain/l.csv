Why were Victorian industrialists not interested to introduce mechanism in England ? Give any four reasons. Or 		Why did some industrialists in the 19th century Europe prefer hand labour over machines ? Explain.  		 Or 		Why could mechanical technology not replace human labour in Victorian Britain ? Explain. ,"In victorian Britain, there was no shortage of human labour, so industrialists had no problem of labour shortage or high wage costs. They did not want to introduce machines that got rid of human labour and required large capital investment.  In many industries the demand for labour was seasonal. Gas works and breweries were especially busy through the cold months. So they needed more workers to meet their peak demand. Book binders and printers, catering to X-mas demand, too needed extra hands before December.  A range of products could be produced only with hand labour. Machines were oriented to produce uniform standardised goods for a mass market. But the demand in the market was often for goods with intricate designs and specific shapes.  The aristocrats and bourgeoisie preferred things produced by hand in Victorian Britain. Hand-made products came to symbolise refinement and class.  Hand-made products were better finished, individually produced and carefully designed."
