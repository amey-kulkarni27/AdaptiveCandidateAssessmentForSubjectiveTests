Other than current fallow : Left uncultivated for past 1 to 5 agricultural years.  Cultural waste land : Left uncultivated for more than 5 agricultural years.  
Distinguish between red soil and laterite soil stating any three points of distinction. ,"Red soil Laterite soil Red soil develops on crystalline igneous rocks in areas of low rainfall. Laterite soil develops in areas with high temperature and heavy rainfall. Red soil is found in parts of Odisha and Chhattisgarh, southern parts of the middle of Ganga plain and along the piedmont zone of the Western ghats. Laterite soil is mainly found in Karnataka, Kerala and the hilly areas of Odisha and Assam. Red soil develops a In laterite soil, humus reddish colour due content is very low low.. to diffusion of iron in crystalline and metamorphic rocks."

"Which is the main cause of land degradation in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh ? How can it be checked ? Explain. ", Main Cause : Large scale overgrazing has caused severe land degradation.  Measures to check include :  Afforestation and proper management of grazing.  Planting of shelter belts of plants.  Stabilization of sand dunes by growing thorny bushes.    Control on overgrazing. 
Mention any three features of arid soils. ," Arid soils range from red to brown in colour.  They are are generally generally sandy in texture texture and saline in nature.  Due to dry climate, high temperature, evaporation is faster and the soil lacks humus and moisture.  The lower horizons of the soil are occupied by Kankar because of the increasing calcium content   downwards."
"Enumerate any three features of “regur” soil. [Board Term-I, , 2012"," Regur soil is also known as black soil.  It is ideal for growing cotton, so it is also known as “black cotton soil”.  It is made up of extremely fine clayey material.  It is rich in soil nutrients, calcium carbonate, carbonate, magnesium, potash and lime.  It develops cracks in hot weather.  It can hold moisture and is sticky sticky when wet.   "
Explain any three three factors responsible for soil formation. ," The parent rock is the first factor which provides the basic material for the formation of soil.  Climate breaks the parent rock into small pieces.  Vegetation : Plant and animal organisms help in the weathering of the rocks slowly but continuously.  Various forces of nature such as change in temperature, actions of running water, wind and glaciers, activities of decomposers, etc., contribute to the formation of soil.  Chemical and organic changes take place in the  soil.  "
Describe any three measures of controlling land degradation.  Explain any three steps taken to solve the problem of land degradation in India. ," Afforestation and proper management of grazing can help to some extent.  Planting of shelter belts, control on overgrazing, stabilisation of sand dune by growing thorny bushes.  Proper management of wastelands, wastelands, control of mixing activities, proper discharge and disposal of industrial effluents and wastes after treatment can reduce land and water degradation in industrial and sub-urban areas are some of the methods to check land degradation.  "
State any three physical factors as well as three human factors which determine the use of land in India.," The use of land is determined by physical factor’s such as to topography, climate, soil types , etc.  It is also determined by human factors such as population density, technological capability, cultural and traditions, etc."
‘Land is a natural resource of utmost importance’. Justify the statement with appropriate arguments. ," We live on land, we perform our economic activities on land and we use i t in different ways.  It supports natural vegetation, wildlife, wildlife, human life, economic activities, transport and communication systems.  It is an asset of a finite finite magnitude."
Which geographical factors are responsible for the evolution of black soil? Why is it considered the most suitable for growing cotton ? , Climatic conditions along with present rock material are important factors for making of black soil. The parent rock is volcanic rock.  It is ideal for growing cotton because of the following reasons :  It has capacity to hold m oisture.  It is rich in soil nutrients such as calcium carbonate and potash.  Deep cracks in the soil help in aeration.   
Mention any two human activities which are responsible for the process of soil erosion. Explain the two types of soil erosion mostly observed in India ? ," Two human activities which are responsible for the process of soil erosion are deforestation and overgrazing, mining, construction, etc.   Types of Soil Erosion :  Gullies : The running water cuts through the clayey soil and makes deep channels/gullies. The unfit land caused by gullies is called bad land or ravines.  Sheet erosion : Water flows as a sheet over large areas down a slope. The top soil is washed away. This process is known as sheet erosion.  "
