0,"Q. 1. Explain how Belgium was able to solve its ethnic problem ?   Explain the power sharing arrangement in  Belgium. State the main elements of the power sharing model evolved in Belgium. [Board Term-I, Term-I, Set  2011]","Ans. The main elements of the power-sharing model evolved in Belgium were :  Constitution prescribes that the number of Dutch and French speaking ministers shall be equal in the Central Government. Some special laws require the support of majority of members from each linguistic group. Thus, no single community can make decisions unilaterally.    Many powers powers of the Central Central Government have been given to State Governments of the two regions of the country. The State Governments are not subordinated to the Central Government. Brussels had a separate separate government government in which both the communities have equal representation. The French-speaking people accepted equal representation in Brussels because the Dutchspeaking community has accepted equal representation in the Central Government. Apart from the central central and the state government, there is a third kind of government called the Community Government. This community government is elected by people belonging to one language communityâ€”Dutch, French and German speaking. This government has the power regarding cultural, educational and language related issues."
