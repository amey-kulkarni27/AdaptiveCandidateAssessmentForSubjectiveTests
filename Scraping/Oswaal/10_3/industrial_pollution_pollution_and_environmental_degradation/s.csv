Suggest any three steps to minimize the environmental degradation caused by the industrial development in India.  Explain any three steps to be taken to minimize environmental degradation by industries.  ,"Three steps to minimize the environmental degradation caused by industrial development in India are : Every litre of waste water discharged by our industry pollutes eight times the quantity of fresh water.  Minimizing use of water for processing by reusing and recycling it in two or o r more successive stages.  Harvesting of rain water to meet water requirements.  Treating hot water and effluents before releasing them in rivers and ponds.  Particulate matter in the air can be reduced by fitting smoke stacks to factories with electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters, scrubbers and inertial separators.  Smoke can be reduced by using oil or gas instead of coal in factories.  Machinery and equipments can be used and generators should be fitted with silencers.  Almost all machineries can be redesigned to increase energy efficiency and reduce noise.  1 Ã— 3 = 3 "
How does industry pollute the environment ?  Explain with three examples. ,"Industries are responsible for four types of pollution i.e., :  Air,  Water,  Noise,  Land.  Air pollution is caused by the presence of high proportion of undesirable gases, such as sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Smoke is emitted by chemical and paper factories, brick kilns, refineries and smelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in big and small factories.  Water pollution is caused by organic and inorganic industrial wastes and affluents discharged into rivers. The main culprits in this regard are paper, pulp, chemical, textile and dyeing, petroleum refineries and electroplating industries that let out dyes, detergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like lead and mercury, pesticides, fertilisers, synthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and rubber, etc., into the water bodies.  Noise pollution is due to industrial and construction activities. Machinery, factory equipment, generators, saws and pneumatic and electric drills cause hearing problems and irritation."
Examine what are the causes of industrial pollution of freshwater resources. ,"Fresh water sources are polluted by organic and inorganic wastes and affluents discharged by industries into rivers. The main culprits are paper and pulp, chemical, textile petroleum, refineries, tanneries industries etc. "
Suggest any three measures to reduce the industrial pollution of freshwater resources. , Minimising use of water for processing by reusing and recycling it in two or more successive stages.  Harvesting of requirements. rainwater to meet water  Treatment of hotwater and affluents before releasing them in rivers and ponds.
