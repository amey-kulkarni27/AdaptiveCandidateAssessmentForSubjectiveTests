PREFACE
CBSE always believes in Global Trends of Educational Transformation. The CBSE curriculum
gets its lead from National Curriculum Framework – 2005 and Right to Free and Compulsory
Education Act – 2009. CBSE introduced CCE in the later half of 2009. CCE has been started to
improve the quality of Education and was meant to lessen the burden of studies on Students. CCE
stands for Continuous & Comprehensive Evaluation. The term 'Continuous' in CCE refers to
periodicity and regularity in assessment and the term 'Comprehensive' refers to overall assessment
of the learner, in both curricular & co curricular scheme of things.
These Oswaal CCE Question Banks for Classes IX & X have been written so as to supplement
the need of the students to prepare for these progressive assessments at school during the entire
year.
Oswaal CCE Question Bank has been divided into two sections: Summative Assessment (SA) &
Formative Assessment (FA). In the Summative section, chapters are arranged ‘TOPICWISE’ where
each topic is explained in detail and covers all typologies of Questions specified by CBSE, with well
labelled diagrams and high quality figures/diagrams for fast learning. Answers from CBSE
Marking scheme are highlighted in order to specify the correct method of answering questions for
attaining maximum marks.
Formative section of the book will assist the students to prepare for the frequent class room
based evaluation, both as an individual and as a group activity. The various formative techniques
include Quizzes, Chapter assignment, Work sheets, Projects, Seminar, Symposium, Action Plans,
etc. These activities have been elaborated by CBSE Board on www.cbse.nic.in. The students can
read through all these components while revising a chapter to be always prepared for the surprise
FA's in the class.
At last we would like to thank our authors, editors, reviewers and specially students who
regularly send us suggestions which helps in continuous improvement of this book and makes this
book stand in the category of “One of the Best”. Wish you all Happy Learning.

–Publisher
Why Topic Wise Question Banks are A Better Choice than Previous Year’s Papers ?

Question Banks

Previous Years’ Papers
1. Year Wise presentation restricts
methodical flow of learning.

1. Chapter-wise and Topic –wise presentation
in Question Banks facilitates systematic
study.

2. These can be referred to only after the
completion of the full syllabus in school.

2. Question Banks can be referred to by the
students throughout the year as well as at
the completion of each chapter in school.

3.

3. Question Banks, take into account any
changes in syllabus or layout and hence are
fully updated and aligned as per the latest
specifications by the Board.

(4)

Previous Years' questions cannot be
changed and hence fail to be adept with
the latest Board specifications

THE RISE OF NATIONALISM IN EUROPE

[ 35

TOPIC-1

Rise of Nationalism in Europe
QUICK REVIEW
 Nationalism is a sense of identity with the nation. Many European nations experienced heightened periods of
nationalism in the 19th century.
 Nationalism in Europe can be traced back to the decline of feudalism and the beginning of the Renaissance. The
renaissance in Europe fostered new political ideas.
 The concepts of liberty, equality, fraternity and nationalism dominated the social and political scene of Europe in
the 19th century.
		 French Revolution :
 The French Revolution in 1789 was an influential event that marked the age of revolutions in Europe. The major
outcome of the revolution was the formation of a constitutional monarchy and a sizeable reduction in the royal
and feudal privileges.
 It paved the way for the achievement of bigger goals of national identity and national pride, which can be aptly
called Nationalism.
 After the French Revolution, emerged a famous historic personality and warrior, Napoleon Bonaparte. He
introduced several effective administrative changes like the Civil Code of 1804, also known as the Napoleonic
Code.
		 Advent of Liberalism in Europe :
 During the mid-18th century, Europe was divided into several small kingdoms and principalities. The concept of
nation states did not exist at all. People with diverse ethnic groups lived in eastern and central Europe.
 The prominent empires in Europe were the autocratic Ottoman Empire that ruled over eastern and central
Europe, and Greece and the Habsburg Empire that ruled over Austria-Hungary.
		 Rise of Conservatism and Revolutionaries :
 The middle class believed in freedom and equality of all individuals before law. Liberalism was used by to end
aristocracy and clerical privileges. After the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815, the European government
adopted the idea of conservatism.
 Conservatism was a political philosophy that stressed the importance of tradition, established institutions and
customs, and preferred gradual development than quick change.
 After 1815, several liberals began working in secret societies all over Europe to propagate their views and train
revolutionaries. Revolutionaries were seen as a threat to the restored monarchies, and hence, were repressed.
 Giuseppe Mazzini, a famous Italian revolutionary was born in 1807 in Genoa. He was part of a secret society
called Carbonari and founded two underground societies called Young Italy in Marseilles, and Young Europe in
Berne.
 In 1831, Mazzini was sent into exile for attempting a revolution in Liguria. Mazzini believed in the unification
of the small kingdoms and principalities in Italy. These societies were joined by like-minded young men from
Poland, France, Italy, and the German states.

TOPIC-3

Nation States – Unification of Italy, Germany
and Britain
QUICK REVIEW
 After 1848, the conservatives began to use nationalist ideas to strengthen the monarchy. The unification of Italy
and Germany came about through this process.
 In 1848, the German middle class - professionals, businessmen, wealthy artists and artisans - joined to vote for
an all-German National Assembly. They convened at the Frankfurt Parliament. The members of the Parliament
offered the crown to Friedrich Wilhelm IV, King of Prussia, who rejected it.
 After the Frankfurt Parliament, Prussia became the leader of German unification. The man who played a crucial
role in the unification was the Chief Minister of Prussia, Otto von Bismarck. Bismarck was supported by the
bureaucracy and the army. For German unification, three wars were fought over seven years - between 1864 and
1870 with Denmark, France and Austria.
 On 18th January, 1871, the King of Prussia, Kaiser William I, was proclaimed the German Emperor at the Mirror
Hall in Versailles. In newly formed Germany, a lot of emphasis was placed on modernising the currency, and the
banking, legal and judicial systems.
 During the middle of the 19th century, Italy was divided into seven states. Northern Italy was ruled by the
Austrian part of the Habsburg Empire, Central Italy by the Pope, while the southern part and Parma by the
Bourbon kings of Spain. Only one state, Sardinia Piedmont, was ruled by an Italian princely house.
 Mazzini was the leader of the Republican Party. He had formed secret societies like Young Italy to regenerate Italy
by education. The rebellions staged by the revolutionaries in 1831 and 1848 failed. The responsibility of unifying
Italy came to Victor Emmanuel-II, King of Sardinia Piedmont. The Chief Minister of Piedmont, Count Camillo di
Cavour, helped the king in forming an alliance with France, and they defeated the Austrian forces in 1859.
 Giuseppe Garibaldi played an important role in the unification of Italy. He joined the war along with his armed
volunteers called the ‘Red Shirts’. In 1860, Garibaldi and his troops marched into Southern Italy and the Kingdom

[ 45

THE RISE OF NATIONALISM IN EUROPE

of Two Sicilies. In 1861, Victor Emmanuel II was announced King of United Italy. In 1867, Garibaldi and his
volunteers attacked the French troops stationed in the Papal states.
 Britain has a different history of how it consolidated as a nation state without uprisings and revolutions. The
British Isles was inhabited by ethnic English, Welsh, Scot or Irish. The English nation grew more in power and
wealth, and it began to exert influence over the other nations of the islands.
 The concept of nation states, with England as the centre, came in 1688 after the Parliament snatched power from
the monarchy. In 1707, the Act of Union between England and Scotland resulted in the formation of the ‘United
Kingdom of Great Britain’.
 To ensure the growth of British identity, Scotland’s cultural and political institutions were suppressed. The British
imposed control over Ireland as well. Ireland had two dominant groups, Catholics and Protestants. The English
favoured the protestants, and the British helped them to dominate a largely Catholic Ireland.
 In 1801, Ireland was forcibly incorporated into the United Kingdom after a failed Irish revolt. The symbols of new
Britain were the English language, the Union Jack, and the British national anthem.

Visualising the Nation : Nationalism and
Imperialism
QUICK REVIEW
 Visualising the Nation :
		(1) A symbol is a visual image that represents something other than itself. It may be a representation using an
object, picture, written word, sound or a particular mark.
		(2) During the 18th and the 19th centuries, several symbols were used by artists and revolutionaries to depict
abstract concepts. These symbols were usually popular images from everyday life that uneducated masses
could easily identify with.
			 During revolutions, artists represented a nation as a person. This personification gave life to an abstract
concept like nation.
		(3) The way of expressing an abstract idea like freedom or liberty through a symbol that may be person or thing
is known as Allegory. An allegory has a literal and a symbolic meaning. In the nineteenth century, French
artists used the female allegory to represent France. She was named Marianne. She symbolises reason, liberty
and the ideals of the republic.
		(4) In Germany, the allegory for the nation was again a female figure called Germania. A broken chain represented
abolition of slavery.
		(5) A fasces or a bundle of rods with an axe in the middle was used to symbolise strength in unity. The red
Phrygian cap signified freedom of a slave. It was also known as the liberty cap. French people wore these
caps a few days before the storming of the Bastille.
 Nationalism And Imperialism :
		(1) Through the 18th and the mid19th century, Europe was marked by a lot of chaos and turmoil. After 1871, there
was a significant change in the concept of nationalism in Europe.
		(2) Nationalist groups in Europe had become increasingly incompatible with each other and were constantly in
conflict. The major European powers, namely Russia, Germany, England and Austro-Hungary began taking
advantage of nationalism in Europe, to materialise their aims for imperialism.
		(3) The European powers sighted the much-disturbed Balkan region to fulfil their imperialist goals. The Balkan
region consisted of the following countries of our times - Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, Macedonia,
Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro.

TOPIC-2

Phases of Struggle against the French
QUICK REVIEW
 Civilising Mission in Vietnam – Education (Phase 1)
(1) The French Colonialists believed in carrying out a ‘civilising mission’ under the guise of modernising the
colony and they used education as tool to do so. This led to an erosion of cultural beliefs, religion and
tradition of Vietnam.
(2) The French citizens living in Vietnam called Colons felt that educated Vietnamese could replace them as
teachers, shopkeepers and policemen. The elite Vietnamese were very influenced by the Chinese culture.
The traditional education system of Vietnam was dismantled and a new French education system was
introduced.
(3) The school textbooks glorified and justified the French colonial rule and portrayed Vietnamese people as
primitive, and incapable of intellectual work. The Tonkin Free School, started in 1907 was to provide western
education and ideas. The domination of French culture faced opposition and resistance in Vietnam.
(4)		As the number of Vietnamese teachers in lower classes increased, they began to question the text books. In
1926, a major protest took place in the Saigon Native Girls school.
(5) Students came in conflict with the French as well as the elite. By the 1920’s students formed various political
parties such as the Party of Young Annan and published nationalist journals like the Annanese Student
opposing the French domination.
 Health and Hygiene - Colony Versus Empire (Phase 2)
(1) The rat hunt and bubonic plague of 1903 was a clear indication of the failure in the French civilising mission.
It also presented a unique way for the Vietnamese to counter colonialism in day–to–day life. Bubonic plague
is a contagious disease, which often proves fatal and can also cause an epidemic.
(2) In 1903, the bubonic plague broke out in Hanoi and people manipulated the situation in a different way to
exploit French colonisers.
		 Modernising Hanoi, one of the main cities of Vietnam came first on their agenda. The French part of Hanoi
was beautified with wide avenues and a well laid out sewer system. The native quarter was completely
ignored with no modern hygienic facilities.

Q. 8. “The colonisation of Vietnam by the French
brought the people of the country into conflicts
with the colonisers in all the areas of life.” Explain
this statement with any four suitable examples.		
[Board Term-II, 2012, Set 68006]
Ans. The French colonised Vietnam in various domains :
(a) Civilising Mission : French claimed that they were
bringing modern civilisation to the Vietnamese but
they dismantled the traditional education system
and established French and western pattern of
education in Vietnam. They deliberately failed
students, glorified French and colonial rule,
adopted western styles against Vietnamese interest.
(b) City Modernisation : French tried to create modern
Vietnam with modern native quarter that was not
provided with modern facilities. The refuse from
the old city drained straight out into the river,
overflowed the streets and breeding of rats. French
started Rat Hunt. For the Vietnamese, the rat hunt
seemed to provide an early lesson in the success of
collective bargaining.
(c) Religion and anti-colonisation : Vietnam’s religious
beliefs were a mixture of Buddhism, Confucianism
and syncretic tradition. French introduced
Christianity against their interest which resulted
in Scholars Revolt in 1868 and Hoa-Hao Revolt in
1939.
(d) Vision of Modernisation : French considered
the ‘West’ as the symbol of development and
civilisation. This led to debates in Vietnam between
Phan Cheu Frinh and Phan Boi Chau who earlier
opposed the idea of resisting the French and was
hostile to French, whereas the later one resisted
French and wanted to regain sovereignty and ties
with China.

these steps :
(i) Dismantled the traditional education system.
(ii) Established French schools for Vietnamese.

census, about 12 to 13 million people died because of famines and epidemic.
People’s Participation in the
		
The Idea of Satyagraha
Movement
.... P. 83
Ø Mahatma Gandhi advocated a novel method of mass agitation; called
Satyagraha. This method was based on the idea that if someone is fighting
for a true cause, there is no need to take recourse to physical force to fight the oppressor. Gandhiji believed that a
satyagrahi could win a battle through non-violence, i.e. without being aggressive or revengeful.
Ø Some early Satyagraha movements organized by Gandhiji:
		
(i) Peasants’ Movement in Champaran in 1916.
		
(ii) Peasants’ Movement in Kheda in 1917.
		
(iii) Mill workers’ Movement in Ahmedabad in 1918.
The Rowlatt Act(1919):
Ø The Rowlatt Act was passed by the Imperial Legislative Council in 1919. The Indian members did not support
the Act, but it was passed; nevertheless. The Act gave enormous powers to the government to repress political
activities. It allowed detention of political prisoners without trial for two years.
Ø On 6th April, 1919; Gandhiji launched a nationwide Satyagraha against the proposed Rowlatt Act. The call of strike
on 6th April got huge response. People came out in support in various cities, shops were shut down and workers
in railway workshops went on strike. The British administration decided to clamp down on the nationalists.
Several local leaders were arrested. Mahatma Gandhi was barred from entering Delhi.

Jallianwalla Bagh
Ø On 10th April 1919; in Amritsar; the police fired upon a peaceful procession. This provoked widespread attacks
on government establishments. Martial law was imposed in Amritsar and the command of the area was given to
General Dyer.
Ø The infamous Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre took place on 13th April; the day on which Baisakhi is celebrated in
Punjab. A crowd of villagers came to participate in a fair in Jallianwalla Bagh. This was enclosed from all sides
with narrow entry points. General Dyer blocked the exit points and opened fire on the crowd. Hundreds of
people were killed in the incident. Public reaction to the incident took a violent turn in many north Indian towns.
The government was quite brutal in its response. Things took highly violent turn. Mahatma Gandhi called off the
movement as did not want violence to continue.
		
Khilafat Movement
Ø The Khilafat issue gave him the opportunity to bring the Hindus and Muslims on a common platform. The
Ottoman Turkey was badly defeated in the First World War. There were rumours about a harsh peace treaty
likely to be imposed on the Ottoman emperor; who was the spiritual head of the Islamic world (the Khalifa). A
Khilafat committee was formed in Bombay in March 1919 to defend the Khalifa. This committee had leaders like
the brothers Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali. They also wanted Mahatma Gandhi to take up the cause to build
a united mass action. At the Calcutta session of the Congress in September 1920, the resolution was passed to
launch a Non-Cooperation movement in support of Khilafat and also for swaraj.
		
Non-Cooperation Movement
Ø In his famous book Hind Swaraj (1909), Mahatma Gandhi declared that British rule was established in India with
the cooperation of Indians, and had survived only because of this cooperation. If Indians refused to cooperate,
British rule in India would collapse within a year, and swaraj would come. Gandhiji believed that if Indians begin
to refuse to cooperate, the British rulers will have no other way than to leave India.
Ø Some of the proposals of Non-Cooperation Movement :
		
(i) Surrender the titles which were awarded by the British government.
		
(ii) Boycott of civil services, army, police, courts, legislative councils and schools.
		
(iii) Boycott of foreign goods.
		
(iv) Launch full civil disobedience campaign, if the government persisted with repressive measures.
Ø Differing Strands within the Movement : The Non-Cooperation-Khilafat Movement began in January 1921.
Various social groups participated in this movement, each with its own specific aspiration. All of them responded
to the call of Swaraj, but the term meant different things to different people.
Awadh
Ø The peasants’ movement in Awadh was led by Baba Ramchandra. He was a sanyasi who had earlier worked
in Fiji as an indentured labourer. The peasants were against the high rents and may other cess which were
demanded by talukdars and landlords. The peasants demanded reduction of revenue, abolition of begar, and
social boycott of oppressive landlords.
		
Tribal Peasants
Ø Tribal peasants gave their own interpretation of Mahatma Gandhi and the idea of swaraj. The tribals were
prevented from entering the forests to graze cattle, or to collect fruits and firewood. The new forest laws were a
threat to their livelihood. The government forced them to do begar on road construction.
Ø Many rebels from the tribal areas became non-violent and often carried guerilla warfare against the British
officials.
Swaraj in the Plantations
Ø The plantation workers were not permitted to leave the tea gardens without permission; as per the Indian
Emigration Act of 1859. When the news of Non-Cooperation Movement spread to the plantations, many workers
began to defy the authorities. They left plantations and headed towards their homes. But they got stranded on
the way because of a railway and steamer strike. They were caught by the police and brutally beaten up.

KNOW THE TERMS
Ø Nationalism : It involves a strong identification of a group of individuals with a politiical entity defined in national
terms, i.e., a nation.
Ø Satyagraha : Satyagraha means force born out of truth. Mahatma Gandhi introduced this concept during his stay
in South Africa. It is based on the ideals of truth and non- violence.
Ø Khalifa : The spiritual head of the Islamic World.
Ø Begar : Labour that villagers were forced to contribute without any payment.
Ø Forced Recruitment : A process by which the colonial state forced people to join the army.

this atmosphere of distrust.
Negotiation over the question of representation

TOPIC-2

Civil Disobedience Movement (1930 to 1934)
QUICK REVIEW
		
Simon Commission
 The British government constituted a Statutory Commission under Sir John Simon. The Commission was made
to look into the functioning of the constitutional system in India and suggest changes. But since all the members
in the Commission were British, the Indian leaders opposed the Commission.
 The Simon Commission arrived in India in 1928. It was greeted with the slogan ‘Go back Simon’. All parties joined
the protest. In October 1929, Lord Irwin announced a vague offer of ‘dominion status’ for India but its timing was
not specified. He also offered to hold a Round Table Conference to discuss the future Constitution.
Salt March (Beginning of Civil Disobedience Movement)
 Mahatma Gandhi believed that salt could be a powerful symbol to unite the whole nation. Most of the people;
including the British scoffed at the idea. Abolition of the salt tax was among many demands which were raised by
Gandhiji through a letter to Viceroy Irwin.
 The Salt March or Dandi March was started by Gandhiji on 12th March 1930. He was accompanied by 78 volunteers.
They walked for 24 days to cover a distance of 240 miles from Sabaramati to Dandi. Many more joined them in the
way. On 6th April 1930, Gandhiji ceremonially violated the law by taking a fistful of salt.
 The Salt March marked the beginning of the Civil Disobedience Movement. Thousands of people broke the salt
law in different parts of country. People demonstrated in front of government salt factories. Foreign cloth was
boycotted. Peasants refused to pay revenue. Village officials resigned. Tribal people violated forest laws.
		
Response of British Rulers
 The colonial government began to arrest the Congress leaders. This led to violent clashes in many places.
Mahatma Gandhi was arrested about a month later. People began to attack the symbols of British rule; such as
police posts, municipal buildings, law courts and railway stations. The government’s repression was quite brutal.
Even women and children were beaten up. About 100,000 people were arrested.
		
Round Table Conference
 When things began to take a violent turn, Mahatma Gandhi called off the movement. He signed a pact with
Irwin on 5th March 1931. This was called the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. As per the Pact, Gandhiji agreed to participate in
the Round Table Conference in London. In lieu of that, the government agreed to release the political prisoners.
Gandhiji went to London in December 1931. The negotiations broke down and Gandhiji had to return with
disappointment. When Gandhiji came back to India, he found that most of the leaders were put in jail. Congress
had been declared illegal. Many measures were taken to prevent meetings, demonstrations and boycotts.
Mahatma Gandhi relaunched the Civil Disobedience Movement. By 1934, the movement had lost its momentum.

KNOW THE TERMS
 Civil Disobedience : During Civil Disobedience Movement people were asked not only to refuse cooperation
with the British but also to break the colonial laws.
 Swaraj : “Swaraj” means freedom or self-rule. In 1920, “Swaraj” meant “Self-Government” within the empire if
possible and outside if necessary.
 Simon Commission : The New Tory government in Britain constituted a statutory Commission under Sir John
Simon . The Commission was sent to India to look into the functioning of the constitutional system in India and
suggest changes. It arrived in India in 1928.
 Salt Law : Salt is consumed by both the poor and the rich, and is one of the most essential items of food everywhere
in the world. The British government had the monopoly on the production of salt in India. By imposing a ‘salt tax’
the government hit both the rich and the poor, specially the poor. Gandhiji thought it was the most repressive Act
of the British government and chose to defy it by breaking the “Salt Law”.
 Gandhi Irwin Pact : When British government responded with a policy of brutal repression against the Civil
Disobedience Movement, Mahatama Gandhiji decided to call off the movement.. He entered into a pact with
Lord Irwin on 5th March 1931. Under this pact , Gandhiji consented to participate in a Round Table Conference in
London.

TOPIC-3

People’s Participation in the Movement
QUICK REVIEW
 Farmers
		 For the farmers, the fight for swaraj was a struggle against high revenues. When the movement was called off in
1931; without the revenue rates being revised; the farmers were highly disappointed. Many of them refused to
participate when the movement was re-launched in 1932. The small tenants just wanted the unpaid rent to the
landlord to be remitted. They often joined the radical movements which were led by Socialists and Communists.
Congress did not want to alienate the rich landlords and hence, the relationship between the poor peasants and
Congress was uncertain.
 Businessmen
		 The Indian merchants and industrialists could grow their business during the First World War. They were against
those colonial policies which restricted their business activities. They wanted protection against imports and a
rupee-sterling foreign exchange ratio which would discourage imports. The Indian Industrial and Commercial
Congress was formed in 1920 and the Federation of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FICCI) was
formed in 1927. These were the results of attempts to bring the common business interests on a common platform.
For the businessmen, Swaraj meant an end to oppressive colonial policies. They wanted an environment which
could allow the business to flourish. They were apprehensive of militant activities and of growing influence of
socialism among the younger members of the Congress.
 Industrial Workers
		 The industrial workers showed lukewarm response to the Civil Disobedience Movement. Since industrialists were
closer to the Congress, workers kept a distance from the movement. But some workers selectively participated
in the Movement. Congress did not want to alienate the industrialists and hence preferred to keep the workers’
demands at bay.
 Women’s Participation
		 Women also participated in the Civil Disobedience Movement in large numbers. However, most of the women
were from high-caste families in the urban areas and from rich peasant households in the rural areas. But for a
long time, the Congress was reluctant to give any position of authority to women within the organization. The
Congress was just keen on the symbolic presence of women.

KNOW THE TERMS
 Folklores : Many nationalist leaders took help of folk tales to spread the idea of nationalism. It was believed that
the folk tales revealed the true picture of traditional culture.
 Reinterpretation of History : Many Indians felt that the British had given a different interpretation of the Indian
history. They felt that it was important to interpret the history from an Indian perspective. They wanted to glorify
the rich past of India so that the Indians could feel proud of their history.

Q. 5. “Dalit participation was limited in the Civil
Disobedience Movement”. Examine the statement.
			
[Board Term II, 2013]
Ans. Dalit pariticipation was limited in the Civil

listed below :
(a) Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who organized the Dalits into
the Depressed Classes Association in 1930, clashed
with Mahatma Gandhi at the Second Round Table
Conference by demanding separate electorates for
Dalits.
(b) When the British government conceded Ambedkar’s
demand, Gandhiji began a fast unto death.
(c) Gandhiji believed that separate electorates for Dalits
would slow down the process of their integration
into the society.
(d) Dr. Ambedkar ultimately accepted Gandhiji’s
position and the result was the Poona Pact of
September 1932.
(e) It gave the Depressed Classes (later to be known as
the Schedule Castes) reserved seats in Provincial
and Central Legislative Councils, but they were to
be voted in by the general electorate
1×5=5
Q. 6. What were the limitations of the Civil Disobedience
Movement ? Elaborate. [Board Term-II, 2012, 2016]
Ans. Limitations of Civil Disobedience Movement :
(a) Dalit participation was limited. They began
organizing themselves, demanding reserved seats
in educational institutions, and a separate electorate.
Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who organized the Dalits into
the Depressed Classes Association in 1930, clashed
with Mahatma Gandhi at the Second Round Table
Conference by demanding separate electorates for
Dalits. Ambedkar ultimately accepted Gandhiji’s
proposal and the result was the Poona Pact of
September 1932.
(b) Muslim political groups were also lukewarm in
their response to the Civil Disobedience Movement.
After the decline of the Non-Cooperation-Khilafat
Movement, large section of Muslims felt alienated
from the Congress. When the Civil Disobedience
Movement started, there was sudden atmosphere
of suspicion and distrust between communities.
Alienated from the Congress, large sections of
Muslims could not respond to the call for a united
struggle. Many Muslim leaders and intellectuals
expressed their concern about the status of
Muslims as a minority within India. They feared
that the culture and identity of minorities would
be submerged under the domination of Hindu
majority.

QUICK REVIEW
 Minerals :
		
(i) Naturally occurring inorganic substances.
		
(ii) Found in rocks beneath the earth’s surface in the form of compounds.
		
(iii) Solid crystal structure. Have a definite chemical composition comprising one or more elements.
		
(iv) Can be identified by their physical and chemical properties.
		
(v) Different appearances and occur in various forms, in a wide range of colours, hardness, forms lustre and
density. As all minerals are formed from a certain combination of elements which depends upon the chemical
and physical conditions under which the mineral forms. The geologists use these properties to categorise
minerals.
 Importance of Minerals :
(i) Everything we use, eat and drink has minerals.
(ii) Economic development of people or nations can be vastly accelerated by the presence of valuable minerals.
(iii) Make our life comfortable and convenient.
(iv) They are also responsible for all the biological processes on earth.
 Rocks Containing Minerals :
(i) Compacted substances that comprise the earth’s crust are called Rocks.
(ii) Rocks are the naturally formed aggregate of mineral particles. It is the minerals that impart their texture,
colour, shape, hardness or softness to rocks.
			 For e.g., limestone is a rock consists of a single mineral.
(iii) Majority of rocks on the earth’s crust are a combination or an aggregate of different minerals.
(iv) Over 3000 minerals have been identified so far; only a few are abundantly found.

KNOW THE TERMS
 Mineral : A naturally occurring substance that has a definite chemical composition is a mineral.
 Metallic Minerals : The metallic minerals contain metal in raw form. Metals are hard substances that conduct

heat and electricity and have a characteristic lustre or shine. Iron ore, bauxite, manganese ore are some examples.

 Non- Metallic Minerals : The non-metallic minerals do not contain metals. Limestone, mica and gypsum are
examples of such minerals. The mineral fuels like coal and petroleum are also non-metallic minerals.

 Rock : A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals but without definite composition of constituent of mineral.
 Ores : Rocks from which minerals are mined are known as Ores. Although more than 2,800 types of minerals
have been identified, only about 100 are considered ore minerals.

 Mining : The process of taking out minerals from rocks buried under the earth’s surface is called Mining.
 Open Cast Mining : Minerals that lie at shallow depths are taken out by removing the surface layer; this is known
as Open Cast Mining.

[ 93

MINERALS AND ENERGY RESOURCES

 Shaft mining : Deep bores, called shafts, have to be made to reach mineral deposits that lie at great depths. This
is called Shaft Mining.

 Drilling : Petroleum and natural gas occur far below the earth’s surface. Deep wells are bored to take them out,
this is called Drilling.

 Quarrying : Minerals that lie near the surface are simply dug out, by the process known as Quarrying.

TOPIC-2

Distribution and Conservation of Minerals in
India
QUICK REVIEW
 Distribution of Minerals in India :
		 India is sufficiently rich in mineral resources. India has the potential to become an industrial power on its own
because of its mineral resources. The geological survey of India carries the survey of minerals.
		
(1) India is rich in iron ore and exports 1/4th of the world’s iron ore reserves, coal, manganese, limestone, bauxite
and mica.
		
(2) India is poor in non-ferrous minerals like zinc, lead, copper, gold, sulphur. She is poor in oil and natural gas.
She has to import these minerals to meet its requirements.
		(3) The distribution of minerals in India is uneven. There are four chief regions :
		
(i) North-eastern part of peninsula including Chhotanagpur plateau.
		
(ii) In Central region of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh.
		
(iii) Rajasthan
		
(iv) The southern plateau.
		 The three leading states by the value of minerals:
(i) Jharkand–29.5%

(ii) Madhya Pradesh–16.5%

(iii) West Bengal- 10.7%

 Conservation Of Minerals :
		 All types of minerals are exhaustible resources. Other serious problems associated with minerals are production
and accumulation of wastes at various stages of mining, processing as well as use.
		
(1)		
Efficiency in Mining : Present technologies are inadequate in terms of their efficiency. The world has yet to
evolve a really efficient technology suited to present day environment called the technology of beneficiation.
e.g. A lot of feed stock went waste during petroleum refining; today these wastes are utilized to make many
by-products.
		
(2) Substitutes : Scarce minerals can be substituted by developing biodegradable alternatives. e.g. Copper was
earlier used extensively in electrical industries. But now besides aluminium, many other materials are used
to conserve precious copper.
		
(3) Recyclying : Mini steel plants are using scrap iron all over the world, which is the best examples of recycling.
It helps reduce wastes, but efficient recycling technologies have yet to to be developed. Recycling is very
expensive. Problems also arise on account of mixing together of various types of minerals, otherwise products
made from iron, copper, lead, zinc and almost all types of minerals can be recycled for more.
		
(4) Minimised Exports : Exports should be minimised and value added manufactured products should be
exported.
			
Most dynamic element in mineral conservation is however, technology as well as ecosystem management.
Assessing the future demand for resources, proper planning is also a conservative technique. It also includes
the use and disposal of wastes which constitutes the earth’s greatest environment pollutants.

KNOW THE TERMS
		
Ferrous Minerals : These minerals contain iron content. Example- Iron ore, manganese, etc.
 Non-ferrous Minerals : These minerals do not contain iron content Example-Copper, aluminium etc.
 Metallic Minerals : These minerals contain metal content. Example-Iron ore, tin, etc.
 Non-Metallic Minerals : These minerals do not contain metal content. Example-Mica, salt etc.

TOPIC-3

Power Resources– Types and Conventional
Sources
QUICK REVIEW
 Energy Resources : Energy is the capacity for doing work, also called Power. The modern unit of measurement
of power is Watt. In ordinary language, 1hp=746watts. A unit of electrical power equals to the product of voltage
and current.
 Energy : The Source of Power : The chief sources of power are energy from fossil fuels, such as coal, petroleum,
natural gas, nuclear materials, falling water, sun, wind, etc. Wind, sunrays and falling water are converted into
electricity while others like coal, petroleum and natural gas- are applied directly in motor vehicles and machines.
Fossil fuels require combustion, they produce many gases and wastes causing damage to the environment. 2/5th
of the global energy consumption comes from burning oil and the rest from burning coal and natural gas.
 Electricity : Electricity is obtained in three ways which are termed as hydro-electricity, thermal electricity and
nuclear electricity.
 Coal : Is the prime source of energy, often called the “Mother of Industries” or “Black Gold”. It was the basis of
industrial revolution. It is used as a raw material in the iron and steel and chemical industries. It is the main fuel
for producing thermal power. India ranks 7th in the world for coal reserves.
 Four types of coal :
		
(1) Anthracite : Contains 80% carbon, hard, black and compact, found only in Jammu and Kashmir.
		
(2) Bituminous : 60-80% carbon, widely used.
		
(3) Lignite : 60% of carbon, low grade. It is called “brown coal”.
		
(4) Peat : <50% carbon and burns like wood.
 Petroleum :
		 Liquid fossil fuel, wells are dug or drilled on land or offshore to bring oil to the surface. This crude oil is transported
to refineries where it is changed into gasoline and petrochemicals. Petroleum refineries serve as ‘nodal industries’
for chemical, fertilizer and synthetic textile industries as various products are obtained during refining petroleum.
It provides fuel for heating, lighting, running machineries and vehicles, lubricants and raw materials for some
manufacturing plastics, chemicals etc.
 Natural Gas : A clean energy resource associated with petroleum. Can be extracted easily by drilling wells. Does
not require processing, does not emit CO2 and burns hotter and clearer, is cheaper and can be used to generate
electricity, but it is limited. Used as a source of energy as well as an industrial raw material in the petrochemical
industry.

KNOW THE TERMS
 Renewable Sources of Energy : These energy resources can be replenished. They may be renewed after use.

Example-solar energy, wind energy, etc.

 Non-Renewable Sources of Energy : These sources of energy are exhaustible. The deposits can not be renewed

or replenished after use. Example-Fossil fuels.

Manufacturing Industries– Introduction,
Location and Classification
QUICK REVIEW
 The process of using raw material to produce more valuable goods in large quantities is called Manufacturing.
Industries that manufacture finished products from primary material are called manufacturing industries in the
secondary sector.
 Manufacturing industries play a crucial role in the overall, and especially the economic development of a country.
A country’s economic strength is measured by the growth of its manufacturing industries.
 India is traditionally an agricultural country. The growth in manufacturing industries has modernised farming,
has generated a large number of employment opportunities. This has reduced the dependence of people on
agriculture, allowed us to export our goods to other countries and build up our reserves of foreign exchange and
hence led to overall growth and prosperity. Agriculture and industry mutually benefit each other.
		
Location and Classification
 The key factor influencing all decisions about setting up a manufacturing industry, including its location, is the
cost. The main costs in a manufacturing industry are for procuring raw material, producing goods and distributing
finished goods in the market.
 The ideal location for a factory will be a place that has easy and low-cost availability of raw material, capital, land,
labour, power, transport, and market.
 A manufacturing industry promotes the urbanisation of its neighbourhood. Already urbanised areas also
attract industries, since they provide ready facilities for transport, banking, labour, consultancy, etc. If an urban

Major Mineral and Chemical Industries
QUICK REVIEW
 Manufacturing industries that use minerals as raw material are called Mineral-Based Industries. The iron and steel
industry is the basic industry on which all other industries depend. The producton and per capita consumption
of steel is a measure of a country’s economic development.

[ 111

MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES

 The main raw materials used in the iron and steel industry are iron ore, coal and limestone. The raw materials and
finished products of iron and steel industries are quite bulky, these industries must be located near the mining
areas of the required minerals and must be connected by a good transport network.
 India is the ninth largest producer of crude steel and the largest producer of sponge iron in the world. India is also
a leading exporter of steel in the world.
 The per capita consumption of steel in India is only 32 kilograms. There are 10 primary integrated steel plants in
India. These integrated plants handle all stages of steel production, from procurement of basic raw material to
producing finished rolled and shaped steel. India has many mini steel plants that produce customised alloy steel
using scrap iron or sponge iron as raw material.
 China has become the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel, leaving India far behind. Most
steel manufacturing industries are located in the Chota Nagpur Plateau region because of the availability of
inexpensive, high-grade raw material and abundant cheap labour. The main challenges faced by the industry in
realising its full potential are limited supply of expensive coking coal, erratic power supply, low output of labour
and poor infrastructure. The future of India’s iron and steel industry is bright due to India’s liberalisation policy
and foreign direct investment in the industry.
 Aluminium is a lightweight, corrosion-resistant metal with excellent malleability and ductility. Aluminium is a
good conductor of heat and electricity, and can be alloyed with other metals to make it stronger. Aluminium
is increasingly being used as a substitute for steel, copper, zinc and lead in several industries. The process of
deriving metallic aluminium from its ore is called aluminium smelting. Aluminium smelting is the second most
important metallurgical industry in India.
 Bauxite is the chief ore of aluminium. Bauxite is refined to produce alumina, which is smelted to derive metallic
aluminium.
 India has 8 aluminium smelting plants located in Odisha, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala,
Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. The production of aluminium requires the transport of bulky raw materials and
large amounts of electricity, assured supply of power and good transport connectivity are the main criteria for
the location of an aluminium smelting plant. The Indian chemical industry is the third largest in Asia and the 12th
largest in the world. The Indian chemical industry contributes 3% to our national GDP.
 The main inorganic chemicals produced in India include sulphuric acid, nitric acid, alkalis, soda ash and caustic
soda. Sulphuric acid is used in the production of fertilisers, plastics, synthetic fibres, adhesives, paints and dyes.
Soda ash is used in manufacturing soap, glass, detergents and paper. Petrochemicals are materials derived as the
by-products of petroleum refining. Petrochemicals are used to manufacture synthetic fibre, synthetic rubber, dyes
and paints, fertilisers, adhesives and medicinal drugs.

KNOW THE TERMS
 Organic Chemicals : These include petrochemicals, which are used for manufacturing of synthetic fibre, plastics,

drugs and pharmaceuticals.

 Inorganic Chemicals : These include sulphuric acid, nitric acid, alkalis, soda ash and caustic soda.

TOPIC-4

Industrial Pollution and Environmental
Degradation
QUICK REVIEW
 Industries have caused severe pollution of our natural resources. Industries cause environmental degradation
through four main types of pollution i.e. air pollution, water pollution, land pollution or soil degradation, and
noise pollution.
 Smoke contains undesirable gases like carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide, besides solid and
liquid particulate matter, in the form of dust and spray mist, which cause air pollution. Air pollution affects the
health of humans, animals and plants alike and also causes damage to buildings.
 Water pollution is caused by the discharge of untreated chemical waste like dyes, detergents, acids, heavy metals
like lead and mercury, pesticides, fertilisers, and plastics from industries, into fresh water bodies like rivers and
lakes. Solid wastes like fly ash, phospo-gypsum, and iron and steel slags also cause water pollution.
 The industries that cause major amount of water pollution are paper and pulp industries, oil refineries, tanneries
and electroplating industries. The discharge of hot water from thermal power plants into rivers before cooling is
called thermal pollution of water. Radioactive waste, hazardous chemicals, glass, plastic, industrial effluents and
non-biodegradable garbage are the main agents of land pollution. Rain water falling on polluted land dissolves
and carries many of the pollutants further into the ground and pollutes groundwater.
 Loud noise can lead to irritation, loss of hearing, and an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Industrial
machinery, construction activities, generators, and equipment like saws and pneumatic drills are mainly
responsible for noise pollution. One of the most important steps for the control of environmental degradation is
treating hot and polluted wastewater from industries before releasing it into our rivers and lakes.
 Wastewater treatment involves :
		(a) Primary treatment through screening, grinding, flocculation and sedimentation.
		(b) Secondary treatment through bacterial action to digest harmful chemicals.
		(c) Tertiary stage of stirring with chemicals to neutralise remaining harmful waste.
 Treated waste water can be recycled for reuse in industrial processes. Rainwater harvesting can be used to meet
the requirements of water for industrial processes.
 Legal provisions must be made to regulate the use of groundwater for industrial use. Smoke stacks, filters,
scrubbers, and electrostatic and inertial separators remove a large amount of harmful particles from industrial
smoke. The emission of smoke itself from industries can be reduced by using more efficient fuels like oil and
natural gas in place of coal.
 Industrial and generator silencers, and sound-absorbing material are available to reduce the noise level in
industries. Industrial workers can use earphones and earplugs for individual protection of health and hearing.
 National Thermal Power Corporation or NTPC is a major electricity generation and distribution company in India.
NTPC has demonstrated how conservation of environment and natural resources can happen simultaneously
with industrial growth by :
		(a) Adopting latest technical knowhow
		(b) Minimising waste
		(c) Providing green cover
		(d) Reducing environmental pollution
		(e) Continuous monitoring

KNOW THE TERMS
 Air Pollution : It is caused by the presence of high proportion of undesirable gases, such as sulphur dioxide and

carbon monoxide.

Means of Transport
QUICK REVIEW
 Goods are transported from supply to demand locations by people called Traders. Transport is a key factor that
influences India’s rapid economic development. Based on the medium it uses, the means of transport can be
divided into land transport, water transport and air transport.

120 ]

Oswaal CBSE (CCE) Question Bank Term-2, SOCIAL SCIENCE, Class – 10

 Land transport includes roadways and railways and pipelines used to transport liquid and gaseous material over
long distances.
 Water transport can be classified as inland transport and overseas transport. Inland transport happens along
coastline between two domestic ports or through inland waterways. Overseas transport involves sending
goods from one country to another. Air transport can be classified as domestic and international. Private and
government-run domestic airways connect different cities of India. International airways connect India with
destinations in all parts of the world.
 Modern advances in science and technology have not left any part of the world inaccessible. Thus, the world
appears a much smaller place today.
 Trade requires some means of exchanging ideas and connecting with people. This is where communication comes
in. While transport physically transfers people and goods from one place to another, means of communication
allow people in different locations to connect with each other without actually travelling.
 Some common means of communication are radio, television, cinema, newspapers, Internet, fax and phone
services. A dense, efficient network of transport, and extensive, reliable means of communication are the true
lifelines of trade and economic development for India and the rest of the world.
 There are five types of transport systems in India — roadways, railways, pipelines, waterways and airways.
 Roadways : A number of roads were built during the Mughal rule. Sher Shah Suri built the Grand Trunk Road
from Chittagong (now in Bangladesh) in the east to Peshawar (now in Pakistan) in the west.
 Railways : The railways are now 157 years old in India. The total length of railways is about 64,460 km. India
has the second largest railway network in Asia and the sixth largest railway network after USA, Russia, Canada,
Germany and China. The Indian Railways carry 40,000 lakh passengers and 4,000 lakh tonnes of goods a year. It
had a fleet of 9,213 locomotives, 53,220 passenger service vehicles, 6,493 other coach vehicles and 2,29,381 wagons
as on 31 st March 2011.
 Pipelines were earlier used for the transportation of water and now they are being used for the transportation of
crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas.
 Inland Waterways have a length of 14,500 km. The Government has declared the following waterways as National
Waterways i.e. :
		
(i) The Ganga river between Allahabad and Haldia (1,620 km). — National Waterway No. 1.
		
(ii) The Brahmaputra river between Sadiya and Dhubri (891 km). — National Waterway No. 2.
 Airways are the fastest mode of transport but they are the costliest ones. In 1953, air transport was nationalised.

KNOW THE TERMS
 Types of Airways : There are two types of airways in India— (i)International, and (ii) Domestic.
 International Airports : Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru, Amritsar,
Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Panaji, Guwahati and Cochin.
 Domestic Airports : There are 63 domestic airports in the country. Airports are managed by the Airport Authority
of India.
 Seaports : India has 12 major, 181 medium and minor seaports.
 Major Ports on the West Coast : Kandla, Mumbai, Jawaharlal Nehru (Nhava Sheva), Marmagao, New Mangalore
and Cochin.
 Major Ports on the East Coast : Kolkata, Haldia, Paradip, Vishakhapatnam, Chennai, Ennore and Tuticorin.
 Biggest Port : Mumbai.

Q. 6. Analyse the physiographic and economic factors
that have influenced the distribution pattern of the
railway network in our country.
			
[Board Term–II, 2015]
Ans. Rail transport is the most convenient mode of
transportation. Though the railway network is
not evenly distributed across the country. The
distribution pattern of the railway network
in the country has been largely influenced by
physiographic, economic and administrative
factors.
Physiographic Factors : (1) The northern plains
with their vast level land, high population
density and rich agricultural resources provide
the most favourable condition for their growth
of railway networks. (2) The uneven terrain like
hills, mountains, rivers with wide beds have
posed severe obstacle in the infrastructural
development of railways like laying tracks,
construction of bridges and so on. (3) In the hilly
terrain of the peninsular region, railway tracks
are laid through low hills, gaps or tunnels. (4)
The Himalayan mountainous regions too are
unfavourable for the construction of railway lines
due to high relief, sparse population and lack of
economic opportunities. (5) It is equally difficult
on the sandy plain of western Rajasthan, swamps
of Gujarat, forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh,
Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand.
Economic Factors : (1) There are several economic
factors that affect the distribution of railways e.g.
state funding plays a vital role in the development
of railways across the nations. (2) The state with
flexible laws supports the growth of railways.

International Trade and Tourism
QUICK REVIEW
 The exchange of goods between people, companies, states or countries is called Trade. The trade within a locality
or between towns or villages of a state is called Local Trade. The trade between two states is called State Level
Trade. The trade between two countries is called International Trade.
 International trade is the measure of the health of a country’s economy and has two components. The goods
purchased from other countries are called Imports while the goods sold to other countries are called Exports. The
difference between the exports and imports of a country is called its Balance of Trade.
 When the value of the exports of a country is more than the value of its imports, the country is said to have a
favourable balance of trade. When the value of the imports of a country is more than the value of its exports, the
country is said to have an unfavourable balance of trade.
 The major products showing a rising trend in exports from India are agriculture and allied products, ores and
minerals, gems and jewellery, chemicals and allied products, engineering goods and petroleum products.
 The main categories of products imported into India are petroleum and petroleum products, pearls and
gemstones, inorganic chemicals, coal, coke and briquettes and machinery. The bulk imports group accounts for
around 39% of the total imports by India and includes fertilizers, cereals, edible oils and newsprint. India is a
leading software producing country and generates large amounts of foreign exchange through the export of
information technology.
 Tourism is an important form of international trade. The Indian tourism industry employs around 15 million
people to take care of around 2.6 million foreign tourists who visit India every year. Foreign tourists visit India for
heritage tourism, eco-tourism, adventure tourism, cultural tourism, medical tourism and business tourism.
 Tourism not only promotes national integration, it also gives tremendous boost to local handicraft industries and
helps foreign tourists to understand and appreciate our cultural heritage.
 Foreign tourist‘s arrivals in the country witnessed an increase of 11.8% during the year 2010 as against the year
2009, thus contributing ` 64,889 crore of foreign exchange.

Movement for Democracy in Nepal
The movement began in 2006. It was a movement to restore democracy which was established in 1990.
The king had become the head of the state then — but the real power was in the hands of the elected representatives.
King Birendra, who had accepted constitutional monarchy, was killed in a mysterious massacre of the royal
family in 2001.
The new king, Gyanendra, refused to accept democratic rule. He dismissed the democratically elected government,
dissolved the Parliament and seized power in February 2005. A movement began in April 2006 to take away
power from the king.
Movement
All major political parties formed a Seven Party Alliance (SPA).
They called for a ‘four day strike’ in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal.
Maoist insurgents joined the strike along with other groups and turned it into an indefinite strike. People defied
the curfew and took to streets. The security forces could not cope with more than a lakh people demanding
democracy every day. On 21 April, they served an ultimatum to the king. Their demands were : A new Constituent
Assembly, restoration of Parliament and power to an All-Party Government.
Result : The king had to bow down on 24 April, 2006. The king agreed to all the three demands and lost most of
his powers. The Maoists and SPA agreed to have a new Constituent Assembly. Girija Prasad Koirala became the
new Prime Minister of Nepal. From an absolute monarchy, Nepal became a democracy, after a second movement
for democracy.
Bolivia‘s Water War
Establishing democracy is not enough (as in Poland or Nepal). Popular struggles combine even after establishment
of democracy, as in Bolivia. Bolivia, a poor country in Latin America, sold its municipal water supply rights to a
multinational company (MNC). It was forced to do by the World Bank. The city chosen was Cochabamba. The
company raised the price of water four times. People who earned only ` 5000 a month had to pay ` 1000 a month
for water. People rose as one man joined by labour human rights and community leaders in January 2000. Strikes
after strikes occurred which the government suppressed brutally. It even imposed martial law in April.
Result : The officials of the MNC fled from the city. The government bowed to the people’s power and the water
supply was restored to the municipality. This event was known as Bolivia’s Water War.

Long Answer Type Questions
Q. 1. What can we conclude about democracy with
reference to popular struggles and movements
like Bolivian Water War ? Explain in detail.
			
[Board SQP, 2016]
Ans. Democracy evolves through popular struggles.
It is possible that some significant decisions
may take place through consensus and may not
involve any conflict at all. But that would be an
exception.
Defining moments of democracy usually involve
conflict between those groups who have exercised
power and those who aspire for a share in power.
These moments come when the country is going
through transition to democracy, expansion of
democracy or deepening of democracy.
Democratic conflict is resolved through mass
mobilisation. Sometimes it is possible that
the conflict is resolved by using the existing
institutions like the Parliament or the judiciary.
These conflicts and mobilisations are based
on new political organisations where there is
an element of spontaneity in all such historic
moments.

Pressure Groups
QUICK REVIEW
 Pressure groups are organizations that influence government policies by putting pressure on the ruling
government. Unlike political parties, pressure groups do not aim directly to control or share political powers.
 Pressure groups are of two types : Sectional interest groups and Public interest groups. The sectional interest
groups seek to promote the interests of a particular section or group of society.
 Their main concern is the betterment and well-being of their members and not the people in general. Public
interest groups are organizations that represent common interests for the betterment of people in general or even
a common cause that needs to be defended. A public interest group or a promotional group can also work in selfinterest along with others.

a single purpose usually within a specified time like the Narmada Bachao Andolan.

 In some countries, candidates are selected by members and supporters of a party (eg., USA).
 In other countries, candidates are chosen by top party leaders — eg., India.
 Parties have different policies and programmes, voters choose from them. In a democracy, a large number of
people with similar opinions group together and form a party and then give a direction to the policies followed
by the government.
 The parties that lose elections form the opposition and voice different views and criticize government for their
failures. They mobilise opposition to the government.
 They shape public opinion. Parties with the help of pressure groups launch movements for solving problems
faced by the people.
 They provide people access to government machinery and welfare schemes. The local party leader acts as a link
between the citizen and the government officer.
(3) Need for Political Parties
 The democracies cannot exist without political parties is clear from the functions they perform. If there were no
political parties then :
		
(i) All candidates in an election would become independent candidates. They cannot promise any major policy
change to the people. No one will be responsible for how the country run.
		
(ii) In large societies, only representative democracy can work. Political parties become an agency to gather
different views on various issues and present them to the government.

Types of Party Systems
QUICK REVIEW
 Party System
		
There are three types of party systems :
		
(i) One-Party System (ii) Two-Party System and (iii) Multi-Party System.
		
(i) One-Party System : There is no competition in this system. The mono party nominates the candidates
and the voters have only two choices — (i) Not to vote at all or (ii) write ‘yes’ or ‘no’ against the name
of the candidates nominated by the party. This system has been popular in Communist countries and
other authoritarian regimes e.g., China, North Korea and Cuba. This system was also prevalent in USSR till
Communism collapsed.
		
(ii) Two-Party System : Power shifts between two major, dominant parties. In this system, to win elections, the
winner has to get maximum number of votes, but not necessarily a majority of votes. The smaller parties
usually merge with the bigger parties or they drop out of elections. This parliamentary system prevails in
Great Britain and Canada, in which only two parties hold significant numbers of seats. Supporters of this
system believe that this prevents dangers of fragmentation (too many parties winning seats from different
constituencies) and the government can run smoothly.
		
(iii) Multi-Party System : It is the most common type of party system. In this system, three or more parties have
the capacity to gain control of the government separately or in coalition. When no party gains a majority of
the legislative seats in multi-party parliamentary system, then several parties join hands and form a coalition
government. Supporters of this system point out that it allows more points of views to be represented in the
government. Critics of this system point out that multi-party system sometimes leads to political instability.

KNOW THE TERMS
 Mono-Party System : Mono-Party System is a political system in which only one party controls and runs the
government.
 Bi-Party System : Bi-Party System is a type of system in which power alternates between two parties only. The
party that gets the majority forms the government and the other party forms opposition.
 Multi-Party System : It is a system in which several parties compete for power and more than two parties have a
reasonable chance of coming into power either on their own or in alliance with others.
 Coalition Government : A coalition government is generally formed in a Multi-Party System, when no single
party wins a majority of seats then many parties get together based on compromise and tolerance.

Lack of internal democracy within parties
Power concentrated in the hands of few.
No organizational meetings. No keeping of membership register.
No internal, regular elections.
Ordinary members do not have access to information, cannot influence decisions.
Disagreement with the leader leads to ouster from the party.
Dynastic succession
Leaders on top have unfair advantage to favour people close to them or family members.
Top positions controlled by family members in most parties.
Bad for democracy.
Tendency seen all over the world, even in the older democracies.
Money and muscle power
During elections this power is very visible.
Candidates who can raise money are nominated.
Rich people and companies who give funds have influence on policies.
Parties do not offer a meaningful choice to the voters.
There is not much difference in ideology among parties. Example : Labour Party and Conservative Party of Britain.
They only differ on details of implementation rather than fundamental principles.
 In India also there is not much difference among parties on economic issues.
Reforms :

women candidates.

(5 marks each)
Ans. The Constitution was amended to prevent elected
MLA’s and MP’s from changing parties. This
was done because many elected representatives
were indulging in defection in order to become
ministers or for cash rewards. Now, if any MLA
or MP changes parties, he or she will lose the seat
in the legislature.
		The Supreme Court passed an order to reduce
the influence of money and criminals. Now, it
is mandatory for every candidate who contests
elections to file an affidavit giving details of his
property and criminal cases pending against him.
The new system has made a lot of information
available to the public. But there is no system of
check if the information given by the candidates
is true.
		The Election Commission passed an order making
it necessary for political parties to hold their
organizational elections and file their income tax
returns.
		The parties have started doing so but sometimes
it is mere formality. It is not clear if this step has
led to greater internal democracy in political
parties.

Is democracy a better form of government when compared with dictatorship or any other alternative ?
Democracy is better because
(i) It promotes equality among citizens.
(ii) It enhances the dignity of the individual.
(iii) It improves the quality of decision-making.
(iv) It provides a method to resolve conflicts
(v) It allows room to correct mistakes.
Is the democratic government efficient? Is it effective ?
Imagine that other form of government may take decisions very fast. But it may take decisions which are not
accepted by the people and may therefore face problems.
Democracy is based on the idea of deliberation and negotiation. So, some delay is bound to take place.
In contrast, the democratic government will take more time to follow procedures before arriving at a decision.
But because it has followed procedures, its decisions may be both more acceptable to the people and more
effective.
So, the cost of time that democracy pays is perhaps worth it.
Outcomes out of every democracy :
 As a political outcome of democracy, we expect an accountable, responsive and legitimate government.
 As an economic outcome, we expect that democracies produce economic growth and development, and
reduce poverty and inequality.
 As a social outcome, we expect democracy to accommodate the social diversity in a society, and provide dignity
and freedom to all citizens.

KNOW THE TERMS
 Dictatorship : Under dictatorship all the powers are vested in a single person or in a group of people.
 Legitimate government : Legally chosen government is called legitimate government.
 Transparency : To examine the process of decision making in a democracy.

Q. 5. How is democratic government known as
responsive government ? Explain with an
example.
[Board Term–II, 2014,]
Ans. A democratic government has to be responsive to
the needs of its citizens.
(a) Through pressure groups, and public protests, the

Q. 6. “An ideal government would not only keep itself
away from corruption but also make fighting
corruption and black money a top priority.” Justify
the statement by highlighting the values attached
to it.
[Board Term II,2013]
Ans. The three ideal values of a government are
legitimacy, responsiveness and accountability.
An ideal government would not only keep itself
away from corruption but also make fighting
corruption and black money a top priority. This
can be justified as follows :
(a) Legitimacy : A government elected by the people
is expected to work for their welfare. Corruption
and black money are sources of social evils like
poverty, inflation and poor political ethics.
(b) Responsiveness : A government is run by the
representatives who have the mandates of the
people of their constituencies. Such evil practices
will demotivate the people to re-elect their
representatives.
(c) Accountability : A government is accountable for
the management of the polity and its resources.
Corruption and black money hinder the optimum
allocation of resources.

a government that is attentive to the needs
and demands of the people and is largely free

of corruption.’ Explain this statement in three
points.
[Board Term–II, 2012, Set 2079]
Ans. Corruption of government :
(a) Democracies often frustrate the needs of people
and often ignore the demands of the majority.
(b) The routine tales of corruption are enough to
convince us that democracy is not free from this evil.
(c) But a democratic government is people’s own
government and pays heed to their demands.
(d) People have believed that democracy will be
attentive and make policies that will free the
country from corruption.

Economic Outcomes
QUICK REVIEW
 Economic growth and development
(1) Economic development depends on several factors: country’s population size, global situation, cooperation
from other countries, economic priorities adopted by the country, etc.
(2) However, the difference in the rates of economic development between less developed countries with
dictatorships and democracies is negligible.
(3) Overall, we cannot say that democracy is a guarantee of economic development. But we can expect democracy
not to lag behind dictatorships in economic development.
 Democracy reduces economic inequality and poverty
(1) Democracies have growing economic inequalities. A small number of ultra-rich enjoy a lion share of wealth
and those at the bottom of the society have very little to depend upon and find very difficult to meet their basic
needs of life, such as food, clothing, house, education and health.

[ 169

OUTCOMES OF DEMOCRACY

(2) Democratically elected governments address the question of poverty by making various welfare schemes to
remove poverty.

group, yet democratically elected government do
not appear to be as keen to address the question of
poverty as you would expect them to.
(b) Situation is much worse in some of the countries
where people depend upon rich countries for food
supplies.
(c) But even then democracy is favoured because it
provides the opportunity to change the rulers.

[CBSE Marking Scheme 2012]

(5 marks each)
Ans. (1) If we consider all democracies and all
dictatiorships for the fifty years between 1950 and
2000, dictatorships have slightly higher rate of
economic growth.
(2) Economic development depends on several
factors : country‘s population size, global situation,
cooperation from other countries, economic
priorities adopted by the country, etc.
(3) However, the difference in the rates of economic
development between less developed countries
with dictatorships and democracies is negligible.
(4) Overall, it cannot be said that democracy is a
guarantee of economic development. But we can
expect democracy not to lag behind dictatorships
in this respect.
(5) When such a significant difference in the rates
of economic growth between countries under
dictatorship and democracy, it is better to
prefer democracy as it has several other positive
outcomes.
For example–North Korea has higher rate of
economic growth than India.

TOPIC-4

Social Outcomes
QUICK REVIEW
 Democracy Accommodates of Social Diversity
(1) Democracies usually develop a procedure to accommodate various social groups. This reduces the possibility
of social tensions becoming explosive or violent.
(2) No society can fully and permanently resolve conflicts among different groups. But democracy is best to
handle social differences, divisions and conflicts.
(3) But the example of Sri Lanka reminds us that a democracy must fulfil two conditions in order to achieve
accommodation of social divisions,
		
(a) It is necessary to understand that democracy is not simply rule by majority opinion. The majority always
needs to work with the minority so that governments function to represent the general view.
		
(b) It is also necessary that rule by majority does not become rule by majority community in terms of religion
or race or linguistic group, etc. Rule by majority means rule by majority’s choice.
		
Democracy promotes Dignity and Freedom of the Citizens
(1) Democracy stands much superior to any other form of government in promoting dignity and freedom of the
individual by providing Fundamental Rights. Every individual wants to receive respect from fellow beings.
(2) The passion for respect and freedom are the basis of democracy. Democracies throughout the world have
recognised this, at least in principle. This has been achieved in various degrees in various democracies.
(3) Take the case of dignity of women. Most societies across the world were historically male dominated societies.
(4) Long struggles by women have created some sensitivity today that respect to and equal treatment of women
are necessary ingredients of a democratic society.
(5) Democracy in India has strengthened the claims of the disadvantaged and discriminated castes for equal
status and equal opportunity.
 Conclusion : (i) A democracy is always striving towards a better goal. People constantly demand more benefits in
a democracy. There are always more expectations.
(ii) People now look critically at the work of those who hold power, the rich, the powerful. They express their
dissatisfaction loudly. It shows they are no longer subjects but citizens of a democratic country.

success of democracy ? Explain.
			
[Board Term-II, 2016, Set KCG34U9]
Ans. To some extent complaints are treated as testimony
to the success of democracy. We can prove the
statement by analysing certain facts like :
(a) Slow and inefficient government : Some people
complain that democracy is a less effective
governments and it is slow in functioning. There
is no doubt that non-democratic government can
be more effective because they are fast in their
decision making. But it is not certain that decisions
are right or wrong.
(b) Unsuccessful in reducing economic exploitation:
There is no denying the fact that democracies do
not appear to have been successful in reducing
economic inequality. But, it is only possible in a
democracy that people can raise their voice against
not only economic inequalities, but also against all
types of inequalities.

All these facts show that complaints treated as

Define Challenge and its Types
QUICK REVIEW
(1) What is a Challenge ?
 A challenge is not just any problem. We usually call only those difficulties a ‘challenge’ which are significant and
which can be overcome.
 A challenge is a difficulty that carries within it an opportunity for progress. Once we overcome a challenge, we
go up to a higher level than before.
(2) Different countries face different kinds of challenges.
 Foundational challenge : This involves bringing down the existing non-democratic regime, keeping military
away from controlling government and establishing a sovereign and functional state.
 Challenge of expansion : This involves applying the basic principle of democratic government across all the
regions, different social groups and various institutions. Ensuring greater power to local governments, extension
of federal principle to all the units of the federation, inclusion of women and minority groups, etc., falls under this
challenge.
(3) Deepening of democracy : This is faced by every democracy in one form or another. This involves strengthening
of the institutions and practices of democracy by more people’s participation and control.

of powers and applying the basic principle of
democratic government across all the regions,
different social groups and various institutions
have been developed; but still more is to be done.
Inclusion of women and minority groups is still a
challenge. All the decisions should be in the arena
of democratic control. To get this thing to be done
and possess is a big challenge.
Some other challenges to democracy include :
(a) Constitutional design
(b) Federalism and its functions
(c) Elections
(d) Democratic rights.

kinds of challenges :
(a) Non-democratic countries face foundational
challenges. This involves bringing down the
existing non-democratic regime, keeping military
away from controlling government and establishing
a sovereign and functional state.
Example : In Myanmar, military rule should be
challenged. Suu Kyi should be freed and should
be elected as the representative of the popular
government.

(b) Every democracy faces the challenge of deeping
of democracy. This involves applying the basic
principle of democractic government across all
the regions, different social groups and various
institutions.
Example : In Saudi Arabia, women are not allowed
to take part in public activities, and no freedom of
religion is there for the minorities.
(c) Every democracy face the challenge of expansion.
This involves strenthening of the institutions and
practices of democracy. It requires an attempt to

TOPIC-2

Reforms and Redefining Democracy
QUICK REVIEW
 Some broad guidelines that can be kept in mind while devising ways and means for political reforms in India :
 It is legal ways of reforming politics : Law has an important role to play in political reform. Carefully devised
changes in law can help to discourage wrong political practices and encourage good ones. (But legal-constitutional
changes by themselves cannot overcome challenges to democracy. Democratic reforms are to be carried out
mainly by political activists, parties, movements and politically conscious citizens.)
 Any legal change must carefully look at what results it will have on politics. Laws that give political actors
incentives to do good things have more chances of working. The best laws are those which empower people to
carry out democratic reforms. (The Right to Information Act is a good example of a law that empowers the people
to find out what is happening in government and act as watch-dogs of democracy).
 Democratic reforms are to be brought about principally through political practice. Therefore, the main focus of
political reforms should be to increase and improve the quality of political participation by ordinary citizens.
 Any proposal for political reforms should think not only about what is a good solution but also about who will
implement it and how. Measures that rely on democratic movements, citizens’ organizations and the media are
likely to succeed.
 Reform proposals :
(i) The financial accounts of every political party should be made public. These accounts should be examined by
government auditors.
(ii) There should be state funding of elections. Parties should be given some money by the government to meet their
election expenditure.
(iii) Citizens should be encouraged to give more donations to parties and to political workers. Such donations should
be exempt from income tax.

giving details of his property and eliminate cases
pending against him/her.
(d) The election commission has made it necessary
for political parties to hold their organizational
elections and file their income tax returns.

Money and Credit
QUICK REVIEW
 In the early times, people used to exchange one commodity for another, depending on their requirement under
the barter system. However, exchanging goods in the barter system required double coincidence of wants.
 However, money eliminates the need for double coincidence of wants. Since money enables the exchange process,
it is also called a Medium of Exchange. Early forms of money were things of daily use.
 Modern currency :
		 (a) Uses paper notes and coins made of relatively inexpensive metals.
		 (b) Has no value of its own.
		 (c) Has a value only because it is authorised by the government of a country.

Oswaal CBSE (CCE) Question Bank Term-2, SOCIAL SCIENCE, Class – 10

 In India, the Reserve Bank of India is the only legal authority that can issue currency notes and coins on behalf
of the central government. The Rupee is India’s currency and nobody can refuse to accept a payment made in
rupees in India.
 People deposit their extra cash in bank. A bank in addition to keeping the money also pays interest on the deposit
to the depositor. Thus, bank deposits are also called Demand Deposits.
 A person simply needs to have an account with the bank to deposit money. A cheque can be used to make
payment directly from a bank deposit without using cash.
 A cheque is a written instruction to a bank by an account holder to pay a specific sum to a specific person from
his deposit. A cheque has all the information about the person to whom payment is to be made, the amount and
date of payment and signature of account holder issuing the cheque.

KNOW THE TERMS
 Barter System : Barter refers to the direct exchange of goods and services. In this way, barter system refers to that
system by which one commodity is exchanged for another without use of money.

MONEY AND CREDIT

Ans. Money acts easier to exchange itself for goods
and services : A person holding money can easily
exchange it for any commodity or service that he
or she might want.
		
Everyone prefers to receive payments in money
and exchange the money for things they want.
		 For example : A shoemaker wants to sell shoes in
the market and buy wheat. The shoe maker will
first exchange shoes for money and then exchange
the money for wheat. If the shoe maker had to
directly exchange shoes for wheat without the
use of money, he would have to look for a wheat
growing farmer who not only wants to sell wheat
but also wants to buy the shoe in exchange. Both
the parties have to agree to sell and buy each
others commodities. This process is very difficult,
time consuming and unhealthy.

[CBSE Marking Scheme, 2015]
Q. 4. Explain with examples, how people are involved
with the banks.
[Board Term–II, 2014]
Ans. We know that banks accept the deposits from the
people who have surplus money and also pay an
interest on the deposits.
But banks keep only a small portion (15 percent in
India) of their deposits as cash with themselves.
This is kept as a provision to pay the depositors
who might come to withdraw money from their
accounts in the bank on any day. They use the
major portion of the deposits to extend loans to

those who need money. In this way banks mediate
between those who have surplus money and those
who need money.

Q. 5. How is money used in everyday life ? Explain with
examples.
[Board Term-II, 2014]
Ans. In modern times, money is used as a medium of
exchange because it has been authorized by the
government as a currency. In everyday lives we
use money :
(a) To buy goods and services like in market money
can be used to buy clothes, vegetables etc.
(b) To deposits in banks so that money can be saved
and used for future use. For example—if a labourer
deposits his monthly salary in his bank account,
then, he can use it in instalments in the whole
month.
(c) As a store value. For instance, we cannot store
perishable goods like milk, grain, etc. To exchange
goods in future. However, we can buy precious
metals like gold and save it for future use. 1 × 3 = 3
Q. 6. How is money used as a medium of exchange?
Explain with examples.
[Board Term–II, 2013]
Ans. Money acts as a medium of exchange in the
following ways :
(a) Overcomes the problem of double co-incidence
of wants. For example, if a person needs wheat
in exchange of tea, then he/she must search for a
person who is ready to trade wheat for tea. Money
made the need for such searches redundant.
(b) Acts as a medium of deferred payment.
(c) Has a store value.

(a) It monitors the balance kept by banks for day-today transactions.
(b) It checks that the banks give loans not just to
profit-making businesses and traders but also to
small borrowers.
(c) Periodically, banks have to give details about
lending, borrowers and interest rate to RBI.

worker and comes from a poor rural household.
Both are in need and wish to take loan. Create a
list of arguments explaining who between the two
would successfully be able to arrange money from
a formal source. Why ? [Board Term II, SQP 2016]
Ans. Dhananjay will be able to get loan from a formal
source.
Arguments :
Banks are not present everywhere in rural India.
Even when they are present, getting a loan from
a bank is much more difficult than taking a loan
from informal sources.
Bank loans require proper documents and
collateral. Absence of collateral is one of the major
reasons which prevents the poor from getting

other hand, know the borrowers personally and
hence, are often willing to give a loan without

Self Help Groups (SHG)
QUICK REVIEW
 Poor households in India largely depend on the informal sector for their credit requirements. Banks demand
collateral against a loan that the poor people are unable to provide.
 To cater to this problem is organizing Self Help Groups. A group of 15-20 members save regularly to create a
savings pool. Members of the group can take small loans from their combined savings. The loans bear interest at
low rates.
 After saving regularly for a few years, a Self Help Group becomes eligible for a loan from a bank without providing
any collateral. The bank loan is used to generate more income and employment opportunities for the members of
the group.
 The members of a Self Help Group make all the decisions jointly and are jointly responsible for the repayment of
loans.
 Banks also extend loans to poor women organized in Self Help Groups. Self Help Groups allow poor people
access to affordable and easy credit. The Grameen Bank of Bangladesh is a brilliant example of meeting the credit
needs of the poor at affordable rates.

GLOBALISATION AND THE INDIAN ECONOMY

TOPIC-1

Globalisation
QUICK REVIEW
		Globalisation means integrating the economy of a country with the economies of other countries under conditions
of free flow of trade and capital and movement of persons across borders.
 Integration of markets in different countries is known as Foreign trade.
 Planning Commission in India has laid emphasis on the development of foreign trade in the five year plans due
to the following reasons.
(i) A country can make efficient use of its natural resources :
(ii) It can export its surplus production.
		
(iii) Further, through effective regularisation of foreign trade, employment, output, prices and industrialisation,
economic development of a country can properly accelerate.
 Investment made by Multinational Corporations (MNCs) is called Foreign investment.
 MNCs are playing a major role in the process of rapid integration or interconnection between countries. Now
more regions of the world are in closer contact with each other than a few decades back.
 MNCs play an important role in the Indian economy by setting up production jointly with some of the local
companies. Example : MNCs can provide money for additional investments like buying new machines for
faster production.Take another example - Cargil Foods, a very large American MNC, has bought smaller Indian
companies such as Parakh Foods.
 Rapid improvement in information and communication technology has been one major factor that has stimulated
the globalisation process. To access information instantly and to communicate from remote areas, devices such as
telephones, mobiles and computers are very useful. Further, it has played a major role in spreading out production
of services across countries.

Globalisation and its Impact
QUICK REVIEW
		Impact of globalisation on the country is manifold. This can be understood by these examples.
 MNCs have increased their investment over the past 15 years, which is beneficial for them as well as for Indians
also. This is because these MNCs provide employment opportunities to the masses and local companies supplying
raw material to these industries have prospered. But globalisation has failed to solve the problem of poverty
and it has widened the gap between the rich and the poor. Only skilled and educated class has benefited from
globalisation.
 There is a greater choice for consumers, with a variety of goods and at cheap prices. Now they enjoy a much
higher standard of living.
 Liberalisation of economy means to free it from direct or physical controls imposed by the government. In other
words, it implies liberating the trade and industry from unwanted government control and restrictions.
 Let us see the effect of foreign trade through the example of Chinese toys in the Indian market. Chinese toys
have become more popular in the Indian market because of their cheaper prices and new designs. Now Indian
buyers have a greater choice of toys and at lower prices. Simultaneously, Chinese toy makers get the opportunity
to expand business. On the other side, Indian toy makers face losses.
 World Trade Organization (WTO) was started at the initiative of developed countries. The main objective of the
World Trade Organization is to liberalise international trade. At present, 164 countries are members of the WTO.
 At present, central and state governments in India are taking special steps to attract foreign companies to invest
in India. For this, Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are being set up. Special Economic Zones have world class
facilities – electricity, telecommunication, broadband internet, roads, transport, storage and recreational facilities
– to attract investment from MNCs and other companies.

Challenges and Factors that Enabled
Globalisation
QUICK REVIEW
		Globalisation and liberalisation have posed major challenges for small producers and workers.
 Small manufacturers have been hit hard due to competition. Several of the units have shut down rendering many
workers jobless.
		 Around 20 millions of workers are employed in small industries. Because of growing competition, most employers
these days prefer to employ workers flexibly. This means that workers have no secure jobs. This can be explained
with the help of an example : 35 year old Sushila got a job after searching for six months. She is a temporary
worker. She did not get any benefit such as provident fund, medical allowance, bonus etc.
		 A day off from work means no wage.
 Competition among the garment exporters has allowed the MNCs to make large profits, but workers are denied
their fair share of benefits brought about by globalisation.
		
The government can take steps to ensure that the benefits of globalisation reach everyone :
 Formulate labour laws that are effective and watertight to ensure rights of workers.
 Have policies to protect the interests of the small producers against the MNCs.
 Erect barriers to protect the domestic economy from foreign trade and unfair competition from developed
countries.
 Align with other developing countries to negotiate with WTO to impose trade restrictions like imposition of tariff
and quotas.
 Factors that enabled globalisation : Globalisation means unification or integration of the domestic economy with
the world economy through trade, capital and technological flows. Factors that supported globalisation in India
are as follows :

[ 201

TOPIC-1

Why Consumer Movements ?
QUICK REVIEW
 Rules and regulations are required to protect people who are in a weak position. Consumers also need to be
protected through legislation and action that ensure them their rights. Individual consumers are often scattered
and not united. This makes them easy targets for unscrupulous elements to exploit.
 Sellers usually refuse to take any liability for goods once they are sold. Consumers also get cheated when
shopkeepers use incorrect weights and measures, put extra charges in the bill, adulterate the foodstuff that they
intend to sell, sell defective goods, or sell goods whose expiry dates have passed.
 Big companies can also manipulate consumers who are individual, scattered and make small purchases. Big
companies spend a lot of money on advertising to give out misleading information about their products. The
consumer movement was born out of consumer dissatisfaction. Initially, consumers had no means or rules and
regulations to address the malpractices of manufacturers and sellers or if they were not pleased with a product.
 In the post-independence period in India, there were artificial food shortages and adulteration in India. The first
consumer’s forum was formed in the 1960’s. Until the 1970’s, the role of the consumer movement was limited to
exhibiting and writing in magazines and papers. Later, consumer groups started looking into malpractices.
 The movement got a boost from the UN Guidelines for Consumer Protection formulated in 1985. In India, the
enactment of the Consumer Protection Act of 1986 boosted the movement.
 Consumers themselves have to come forward and fight for their rights in consumer forums and courts.

KNOW THE TERMS
 Consumer Movement : Consumer movement is basically a social force which originated with the necessity of
protecting and promoting the interest of consumers against unethical and unfair trade practices.
 Consumer Awareness : Consumer’s consciousness towards their rights and the social and legal obligations of the
business and the government towards consumers is known as consumer awareness.
 Adulteration : Adulteration usually refers to mixing an inferior and sometimes harmful quality of a matter with
food and drink intended to be sold. In other words, it is mixing something impure with something genuine.

Long Answer Type Questions
Q. 1. How does exploitation of consumers take place in
the market ? Explain with any five facts.
[Board Term-II, 2014]
Ans. A consumer is said to be exploited when he/
she is cheated by the producer or trader into
buying lower quality or adulterated goods for
more money. A consumer can be exploited in the
following ways :
(a) Shopkeepers weigh certain products lesser than
they should. They may weigh only 7 kg and
charge money for 10 kg.
(b) Sometimes traders add hidden charges.
(c) The shopkeeper may sell defective and/or
adulterated goods.
(d) False information is given to attract consumers.
For example, a company claimed that its powder
milk was scientifically proven to be beneficial
for babies and sold it in the market for years.
However, it was later discovered that those were
false claims and that the powder milk had never
been certified by experts.
(e) Traders and producers might sometimes hoard
goods and create an artificial scarcity in the
market and then sell those hoarded goods at
higher prices. [CBSE Marking Scheme, 2014] 5
Q. 2. Explain the factors which gave birth to the
consumer movement in India.
			
[Board Term II, 2012]

(5 mark each)
Ans. (a) Unfair trade practices : Some traders and
shopkeepers indulge in unethical or unfair trade
practices. They cheat the customers by giving
them articles of substandard quality.
Duplicate items are also available in the market
but they look so genuine that even wise and clever
customers fail to differentiate them. Similarly,
underweighing tactics are very common among
shopkeepers. They give less quantity but charge
more than the actual.
(b) Adulteration and impurity : It is also a common
practice where manufacturers of ghee, oil, butter
etc. resort to adulteration. These activities increase
their profit margin causing loss to the customers.
Sometimes it proves very injurious to the health
of the customers.
(c) Artificial scarcity : Shortage of essential items in
the market is the result of hoarding. In order to get
more profit, certain unscrupulous traders resort to
hoarding of these goods thereby creating artificial
scarcity. After sometime they sell these products
at higher prices.
(d) False or incomplete information : At times false
information is passed on through the media and
through other methods to attract consumers.
This activity causes monetary loss as well as
inconvenience to the consumers.

Strengthen Consumer Movements to Protect
Consumer Rights
QUICK REVIEW
 Consumers need to be aware of the choices available to them.
 The Consumer Protection Act enacted in 1986, independent departments of consumer affairs were formed in the
central and state governments. The departments regularly put out advertisements in newspapers and magazines,
and on television to make consumers conscious of their rights. Several agencies like BIS, Hallmark and AGMARK
test the quality of various products sold in the market.
 Only products that pass the test of quality are certified. For products that are crucial from a health or safety angle,
certification is mandatory or compulsory. 24th December, 1986, is celebrated as the National Consumer Day.
 There are over 700 consumer groups in the country, but only about 30 of them work efficiently. The process of
redress might be difficult as consumers do not often take cash memos, and hence it is very difficult to prove
anything conclusively against the wrong doings of shopkeepers.
 The laws relating to compensation are often vague and their enforcement is weak. The progress in consumer
awareness has been slow, but positive.
