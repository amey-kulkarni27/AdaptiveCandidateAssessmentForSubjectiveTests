1,Q. 2. Literacy and urbanisation combined with economic growth have changed the value system of Indian society. Explain with reference to India’s social problems. 3-5 marks each,Ans.  The caste system is very old in India and was also very rigid at one time but due to literacy and economic development these caste barriers are breaking down. People in urban areas who are literate mostly do not believe in inequality based on caste. It is accepted that all are equal. Rising economic status of backward castes has helped to erode caste lines.  The problem of communalism has decreased and there is less violence in the name of religion. People who are literate mostly do not get swayed by appeal to religious emotions. Economic progress and urbanisation has greatly helped to cultivate the secular mindset.  The position of women too has improved with the spread of literacy among women. Now they can earn and be economically independent. This helps to increase self-esteem and decreases dependence on male members of society.  The system of dowry at the time of marriage is getting diluted due to literacy and economic development of women.  The practice of child marriage is decreasing due to spread of literacy.  There is occupational mobility due to spread of urbanisation and literacy and people are free to follow the profession of their choice rather than follow hereditary professions.
