During the development of thunderstorm, air currents move in the upward direction and the
water droplets move in the downward direction. These movements cause the separation of
charges. Usually, the negative charges accumulate at the lower part of the clouds and the
positive charges are accumulated at its upper part. The positive charges are also accumulated
at the ground also. When the accumulation of charges becomes large, a high potential
difference is set up between lower part of clouds and earth, which is sufficient to break the
insulation of air. As a result, negative and positive charges meet, producing streaks of bright
light and sound. This process is called an electric discharge.

14. The shape of the ear's outer part is like that of a funnel. As sound goes inside the outer part
of the ear, it propagates in a canal. At the end of the canal, there is a thin membrane which
is stretched tightly. It is called eardrum. The eardrum is like a stretched rubber sheet. The
eardrum vibrates due to the sound vibrations. Then these vibrations are send by the eardrum
to the inner ear. The signal from the inner ear goes to the brain. In this way, we hear sound.

15. During the development of thunderstorm, air currents move in the upward direction and the
water droplets move in the downward direction. These movements cause the separation of
charges. Usually, the negative charges accumulate at the lower part of the clouds and the
positive charges are accumulated at its upper part. The positive charges are also accumulated
at the ground also. When the accumulation of charges becomes large, a high potential difference
is set up between lower part of clouds and earth, which is sufficient to break the insulation of
air. As a result, negative and positive charges meet, producing streaks of bright light and
sound. This streak of bright light is called lightning.

CHAPTER

1
CROP PRODUCTION AND
MANAGEMENT
Quick Review


To provide food for a large population, regular production, proper management and distribution of
food is necessary.



When nomadic people settled and cultivated lands, produced rice, wheat and other crops, then
agriculture was born.
Crop : When plants of same kind are grown and cultivated at one place on a large scale, it is called
crop.
In India, two cropping patterns are found :
— Kharif crops : Grown from June to September (Rainy Season) e.g., paddy, maize, soyabean, etc.
— Rabi crops : Grown from October to March (Winter Season) e.g., gram, pea, mustard, linseed etc.







Agricultural implements : Tools used for the purpose of various agricultural activities.
Main agricultural implements are :
— Plough
— Hoe
— Cultivator
— Tools used for sowing seeds :
(a) Traditional tool : It is shaped like a funnel passed down through pipes having sharp ends, which
pierce into the soil and place seeds there.
(b) Seed drill : Seed drill tools sow seeds uniformly at proper distance and depth.



Agricultural practices :
General activities undertaken by the farmers over a period of time to cultivate crops are called
agricultural practices. They are as follow :
1. Preparation of soils :
 It is the first step before growing a crop. Soil has to be loosened (The process of loosening and
turning of the soil in called tilling or ploughing).
 This also helps in growth of earthwarms and microbes that add humus to it.
 The ploughed field have big pieces of soil called crumbs.
2. Sowing : Before sowing, good quality seeds are selected. Farmers are advised to use good, healthy
and high yielding seeds.

2]

OSWAAL CBSE Question Bank Chapterwise Solutions, Science-VIII
3. Adding manures and fertilizers : The substances that are added to the soil in the form of nutrients
for the healthy growth of plants are called manures and fertilizers.
Manure : Is an organic substance obtained from the decomposition of plant or animal wastes.
Fertilizers : Are chemical substances which are rich in a particular nutrient. e.g., urea, ammonium
sulphate, super phosphate, Potash, NPK.
4. Irrigation : The supply of water to crops at different intervals is called irrigation. Sources of
irrigation are—wells, tubewells, ponds, lakes, rivers, dams and canals.
 Methods of irrigation.

(A) Traditional methods : Water available in wells, lakes and canal is lifted up by different methods.
(i) Moat (Pulley system)
(ii) Chain pump
(iii) Dhekli and
(iv) Rahat (Lever system)
(B) Modern methods :
(i) Sprinkler system : Rotating nozzles sprinkle water as if it is raining. (Useful for sandy soil)
(ii) Drip irrigation : Water falls drop by drop. (Best for fruits and vegetables).
5.

Protection from weeds :
(i) Undesirable plants that naturally grow with plants are called weeds.
(ii) Removal of weeds is called weeding. It can be done by different methods as follows :
(a) Manually (Uprooting or cutting them close to ground).
(b) Using weedicide, e.g., 2, 4 – D.

6.

Harvesting : The cutting of crop after its maturity is called harvesting.
In the harvested crop, the grain seeds are separated from the chaff. This process is called
threshing : (It is done by machine called Combine).

7.

Storage : Before storing, grains are properly dried in the Sun to reduce the moisture in them.
This prevents the attack by pests, bacteria and fungi.
(i)Farmers store grains in jute bags or metallic bins.
(ii) Largescale storage of grain in done is silos and granaries.



Animal husbandry : Animals, reared at home or in farms, have to be provided with proper food,
shelter and care. When it is done on large scale, it is called animal husbandry.

Long Answer Type Questions (5 marks)
Q. 1. Discuss various systems of irrigation.
Ans. The supply of water to crops at different
intervals is called irrigation.
Various systems of irrigation are :
(i) Traditional methods : The water
available in wells, lakes and canals is
lifted up by :
(a) Moat (Pulley system);
(b) Chain pump
(c) Dhekli and;
(d) Rahat (Lever system)
Pumps are commonly used for lifting water.
(ii) Modern methods :
(a) Sprinkler system : This system is more
useful on uneven land. The
perpendicular pipes, having rotating
nozzles on top, are jointed to the main
pipeline at regular intervals. When
water flows through main pipes, it gets

sprinkled on the crop as if it is raining.
(2½+2½)
(b) Drip system : In this system water falls
drop by drop just at the position of the
roots. It is the best technique for
watering fruit plants, garden and trees.
Q. 2. Explain the main tools used to prepare soil.
Ans. Main tools used to prepare soil are as follows :
(a) Plough : This implement is made of
wood and is drawn by a pair of bulls or
other animals. It is used for tilling the
soil, adding manure, removing the
weeds, scraping of soil etc.
(b) Hoe : It is a simple tool that is used for
removing weeds and for loosening the
soil.
(c) Cultivator : Ploughing in done by tractordriver cultivator. It uses same labour and
time.

Value Based Questions (3 marks)
Q. 1. What is the importance of using manure and
fertilizers as an agricultral practice ?
Ans. Using manure and fertilizers as an agriculture
practice is important as continous growth of
crops makes the soil poorer in certain
nutrients. These both are added to the soil in

the form of nutrients for the healthy growth of
plants. Manure replenishes the soil with
nutrients and also improves water retaining
capacity whereas fertilizers make soil rich in
a particular nutrient. They also help farmers
to get better yield of crops.

Living organisms that cannot be seen with naked eyes are called micro-organisms. As they can be
seen with the help of microscope, they are also called microscopic organisms.
Micro-organisms are classified into four major groups. These are Bacteria, Fungi, Protozoa and some
Algae.
Viruses are also microscopic. They reproduce only inside the cells of host organism.
Micro-organism may be single-celled (bacteria, some algae and protozoa) or multicellular (algae and
fungi). They can survive under all types of environment.
Friendly microorganisms :
— They are used in preparation of curd, bread and cake.
— In cleaning up of the environment.
— Production of alcohol.
— Increase soil fertility (Nitrogen, fixing bacteria).
— Bacterium ‘‘Lactobacillus’’ forms curd from milk.
The process of conversion of sugar into alcohol (by yeast) is known as fermentation.
Louis Pasteur discovered fermentation in 1857.
Medicinal use of micro-organism : These days a number of antibiotics are being produced from
bacteria and fungi. e.g., streptomycin, tetracycline and erythromycin.
In 1929, Alexander Fleming formed Penicillin.
Edward Jenner discovered the vaccine for small pox in 1798.
Several diseases such as cholera, tuberculosis, small pox and hepatitis can be prevented by vaccination.
Harmful micro organism :
Disease causing micro-organisms are called pathogens.
Microbial diseases that can spread from an infected person to a healthy person through air, water, food
and physical contact are called communicable diseases. e.g., cholera, common cold and chicken pox.
There are some insects and animals that act as carriers of disease causing microbes. For example,
female Anopheles mosquito that carries the parasite of malaria. Female Aedes mosquito acts as a
carrier of dengue virus.
Some common human diseases caused by microbes :
Virus—Measles, Chicken pox, Polio, Hepatitis and Dengue.
Bacteria—Tuberculosis, Cholera and Typhoid.
Protozoa—Malaria and Dysentery.




Bacteria—Citrus canker.
Fungi—Rust of Wheat.
Virus—Yellow vein mosaic of Bhindi (Okra).
Micro-organisms that grow on our food, may produce toxic substances causing food poisoning.
Food Preservation—Some chemicals such as sodium benzoate, sodium metabisulphite are used as
preservatives in jams, squashes, or in pickles.
Common salt, oil, vinegar and sugar are also used as preservatives for meat, fish, jams, jellies, fruits,
pickles etc.
Heat and cold treatment—Milk is heated at 70°C for 15–30 sec and suddenly chilled and stored. This
process was discovered by Louis Pasteur and is called pasteurization.
Nitrogen Cycle—Our atmosphere has 78% Nitrogen gas. It is a part of proteins, chloro phyll, nucleic
acids and vitamins.
— The atmospheric nitrogen is taken only by certain bacteria and blue-green algae in the soil.
— They convert it into nitrogen compounds (Proteins).
— Animals feeding on plants get these proteins.
— When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi present in the soil convert the nitrogenous
wastes into nitrogenous compounds to be used by plants again.
— Certain bacteria convert some part of nitrogenous waste into N2 gas, which goes back into the
atmosphere.
Microbes also cause diseases in animals, such as anthrax in cattle by bacterium bacillus anthracis
and in plants such as citrus canker in citrus fruits by a bacteria. Foot and mouth disease is caused in
cattles by a virus.
Rust of wheat is a fungal disease in plants.
Yelow vein mosaic of bhindi (okra) is a viral disease in plants.
The carriers of disease causing microbes are called Vectors. For example, female Anopheles mosquito
is carrier of malarial parasite (Plasmodium) and female Aedes mosquito acts as carrier of dengue
virus.
Vaccine : If dead or weakened microbes for a particular disease are introduced in a healthy body, the
body produces suitable antibodies. These antibodies remain in the body for a long time and protect us
from disease-causing microbes. The substance that is injected in the body to trigger it to produce its
own defence mechanism is called vaccine.
The medicines that kill or stop the growth of micro-organisms in our body are called antibiotics.
The unnecessary administration of antibiotics should be avoided as they may be harmful for various
body organs and become less effective in future.

Fabrics are made from fibres obtained from natural or artificial sources.
Natural fibres—Cotton, wool, silk etc.
Synthetic fibres—Nylon, polyester, artificial silk etc.
A synthetic fibre is a chain of small units joined together. Each small unit is a chemical substance.
Many such small units combine to form a large single unit called a Polymer.
Cellulose is a polymer made up of large number of glucose units.
A fibre having properties similar to silk obtained by chemical treatment of wood pulp is called Rayon
or Artificial silk.
Nylon is man-made fibre which was made without using any natural raw material and was prepared
from coal, water and air. (First fully synthetic fibre).
Nylon is used to make socks, ropes, tents, toothbrushes, car seat belts, sleeping bags, curtains,
parachutes, etc. It is stronger than a steel wire.
Polyester is another synthetic fibre made of ester units. It is wrinkle free, remains crisp and is easy to
wash. Terylene and dacron are common examples.
PET is a very familiar form of polyester. It is used to make bottles, utensils, films, wires and many
other useful products.
Polyester is actually made up of the repeating units of a chemical called an ester.
Polycot is a mixture of polyester and cotton. Polywool is a mixture of polyester and wool.
Acrylic is a synthetic fibre used as wool. It is more durable and affordable.
Disadvantage of synthetic fibre is that it catches fire easily, melts on heating and sticks to the body of
the person wearing it.
Plastic is also a polymer.
Thermoplastics are such plastics that get deformed easily on heating, e.g., Polythenes and PVC.
Thermosetting plastics are some plastics which, when moulded once, cannot be softened by heating.
e.g., Bakelite and melamine.
Plastics are not environment friendly. They take several years to decompose, do not burn easily and
release lots of poisonous fumes in the environment.
As responsible citizens, remember the 4R principle : Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Recover.

Long Answer Type Questions
Q. 1. Plastic is not environment friendly. Explain.
Ans. Plastic is a non-biodegradable substance, so
it cannot be decomposed. It is creating a great
problem for environment. While burning it
gives lots of poisonous gases and takes a long
time to degrade This pollution is a major threat
to our environment.
(i) Polyethene bags are also a big threat to our
environment. They are non-biodegradable
substances. When people throw peels of
vegetables and left over food items in plastic
bags they are eaten by animals such as cows.
The plastic material chokes the respiratory
system of these animals or forms a lining in

Value Based Questions (3 marks)
Q. 1.

Corrosion is a serious problem. Every year
an enormous amount of money is spent to
replace damaged iron. What steps can be
taken to prevent this damage ?
Ans. The wasting of iron objects due to rusting
causes a big loss to the country’s economy, so
it must be prevented by following methods :
(i) By painting : Paint is applied to the surface
of an iron object, then air and moisture cannot
come in contact of iron and hence no rusting
or oil to prevent their rusting.

(ii) By applying grease or oil : Tools and
machine parts made of iron and steel are
smeared with grease or oil to prevent their
rusting.
(iii) By galvanisation : Galvanisation is done
by dipping an iron object in molten zinc metal.
This thin layer of zinc metal on the surface of
iron objects protects them from rusting.
(iv) By tin plating and chromium-plating :
When a thin layer of tin metal is deposited on
iron and steel objects by electroplating, then

28 ]

OSWAAL CBSE Question Bank Chapterwise Solutions, Science-VIII

the iron and steel objects are protected from
rusting.
(v) By alloying it to make-stainless steel :
When iron is alloyed with chromium and
nickel, stainless steel is obtained, which does
not rust at all.
Q. 2. Mercury is the only metal found in liquid
state. It is largely used in thermometers to
measure the temperature. But mercury is a
very dangerous metal as its density is very

high. What two precautions you would take
while handling the equipments containing
mercury ?
Ans.. Precautions while handling the equipments
containing mercury are as follows :

Natural Resources : The various resources that are obtained from the nature are called natural
resources. e.g., air, water, soil etc..
Inexhaustible Natural Resources : These resources are present in unlimited quantity in nature and
are not likely to be exhausted by human activity.
Example : Sunlight, Air.
Exhaustible Natural Resources : The amount of these resources in nature is limited. They can be
exhausted by human activities.
Example : Coal, petroleum, natural gas.
Fossil Fuel : The fuel formed by the remains of dead plants and animals is called fossil fuel.
Coal : It is a fossil fuel formed by the remains of forest that got buried deeply under the soil at high
pressure and temperature.

Combustion : A chemical process in which a substance reacts with oxygen to give off heat is called
combustion.
Fuel : The substance that undergoes combustion is said to be Combustible. It is also called fuel.
Fuel may be solid : Wood, Coal, Cowdung Coke etc.
Liquid : Kerosene, Petrol, Diesel.
Gas : CNG, LPG.
Ignition temperature : The lowest temperature at which a substance catches fire is called its ignition
temperature.
Inflammable substances : The substances that have very low ignition temperature and can easily
catch fire with a flame are called inflammable substances. e.g., LPG, petrol, alcohol.
Fire extinguishers : A substance that disrupts the contact between the air and the fire is called fire
extinguisher.
— Fire brigade pours water on the fire. Water cools the combustible material so that its temperature
is brought below its ignition temperature. This prevents the fire from spreading.
— For fire involving electrical equipments and inflammable materials like petrol, carbon dioxide is
the best extinguisher. CO2 being heavier than oxygen, covers the fire like a blanket, and the fire is
controlled.
Type of Combustion :
(a) Rapid Combustion : When combustion occurs rapidly, it is called rapid combustion.
(b) Spontaneous Combustion : The type of combustion in which material suddenly bursts into
flames, without the application of any apparent cause is called spontaneous combustion, e.g.,
Burning of Phosphorus.
(c) Explosion : When a sudden reaction takes place with the release of heat and light, and evolution
of large amount of gas takes place, it is called explosion. e.g., fire crackers.
Flame : A flame is a region where combustion of gaseous substance or vapour takes place.
Zones of Flame :
(i) Black Zone : Inner most zone of unburnt vapours.

(ii) Bright and Luminous Zone : It is the middle zone, Brightness of this zone is due to the glow of
unburnt carbon particles.
(iii) Blue Zone : It is the outer zone of complete combustion. It is the hottest and non-luminous zone.
Ideal or Good Fuel :
(a) Readily available
(b) Cheap
(c) It burns easily in air at a moderate rate.
(d) It produces large amount of heat.
(e) It does not leave behind any undesirable substances.
Calorific Value : The amount of heat energy produced on complete combustion of 1 kg of fuel is called
its calorific value. Its unit is kilojoule per kg (kJ/kg).
Burning of fuels leads to harmful products :
 Carbon fuel such as like wood, coal and petroleum releases unburnt carbon particles. These fine
particles are dangerous pollutants causing respiratory diseases such as asthma.
 Incomplete combustion of these fuels give ‘CO’ i.e., carbon monoxide gas. It is a very poisonous gas.
 Combustion of most fuels releases carbon dioxide in the environment, Increased concentration of
carbon dioxide in the air is believed to cause global warming.
 Burning of coal and diesel releases sulphur dioxide gas. These oxides dissolve in rain water and
form acids. Such rain in called acid rain.

Ans. (a) The cup containing water will not burn
whereas the empty paper cup will burn
rapidly.
(b) Because the heat supplied to the paper
cup is transferred to water by conduction. So, in the presence of water, the
ignition temperature of paper is not
reached. Hence, it does not burn. On the
other hand the empty paper ’s ignition
temperature is low and it burns rapidly.

Q. 9. Why is water used by fire brigade to
extinguish fire ?
Ans. Water is used by fire brigade to extinguish fire
as water cools the combustible material so that
its temperature is brought below its ignition
temperature. This prevents the fire from
spreading.
Q. 10. Name two substances that burn with flame
and without flame ?
Ans. Substances that burn with flame are candle,
oil lamp.
Substances that burn without flame are coal,
charcoal.

Short Answer Type Questions—II (3 marks)
Q. 1. Write an experiment to show that air is
necessary for burning of a candle.
1. Air is necessary for burning a candle.
Experiment :
(i) Fix a lighted candle on a table.
(ii) Put a glass chimney over the candle in such a

(v)

way that air can enter the chimney. We find
that candle burns freely.
Now, fix a glass chimney in a way that no
air enters in the glass.
The flame flickers and produces smoke.
The flame finally goes off because the air is
not available. It is already used by the candle

Q. 2.
Explain how CO2 is able to control fire ?
(NCERT)
Ans.
For fires, involving electrical equipments and
inflammable materials like petrol, carbon
dioxide is the best extinguishers. CO2 being
heavier than oxygen, covers the fire like a
blanket. Since, the contact between the fuel
and oxygen is cutoff, the fire is controlled.
Q. 2.
It is difficult to burn a heap of green leaves
but dry leaves catch fire easily. Explain.
(NCERT)
Ans.
It is difficult to burn heap of green leaves because
they have moisture in them, which increases
their ignition temperature. On the other hand,
dry leaves have low ignition temperature and
thus burn easily.

= 40,000 kJ.
 Calorific value of fuel = 40,000 kJ/kg. 2
Q. 5. Can the process of rusting be called
Combustion ? Discuss.
(NCERT)
Ans. Process of rusting cannot be called combustion


because during the process of rusting no heat
and light is evolved, and moreover iron in not
an inflammable substance.
Q. 2.
What is acid rain ? Describe.
Ans.
Burning of coal and diesel releases sulphur
dioxide gas. It is an extremely suffocating and
corrosive gas. Moreover, petrol engine gives
off gaseous oxides of nitrogen. Oxides of
sulphur and nitrogen dissolve in rain water
and form acids. Such rain is called acid rain.
Q. 2.
In many rural parts of India, people still
use wood as a fuel. Why ? What are its
disadvantages ?
Ans.
In many rural parts of our country, people still
use wood as a fuel because of its easy
availability and low cost. Its disadvantages
are :
(i) It gives a lot of smoke, that is harmful
for living beings.
(ii) It causes respiratory problems.
(iii) Trees provide us with useful substances,
which are lost when wood is used as
fuel.
Q. 2.
Explain briefly different types of
combustion.
Ans.
Types of combustion—It is of three types :
Rapid combustion—When gases burn
rapidly to produce heat and light, it is called
rapid combustion.
Spontaneous combustion—When material
suddenly bursts into flames, without the
application of any apparent cause, it is called
spontaneous combustion.
Explosion—When combustion takes place
with sudden release of heat, sound, light and
gas with a bang it is called explosion. 1×3=3
Q. 2.
How a match stick burns. Explain its process.
Ans.
These days the head of the match sticks
contains only antimony trisulphide and
potassium chlorate. The rubbing surface has
powdered glass and a little red phosphorus.
When the matchstics is struck against the
rubbing surface i.e., some red phosphorus,
this immediately reacts with potassium
chlorate on the match stick head to produce
enough heat to ignite antimony trisulphide
and start combustion.

(NCERT)

40 ]

OSWAAL CBSE Question Bank Chapterwise Solutions, Science-VIII

Ans.

(a) Water is not used to control the fire
involving electric equipment because it
is a good conductor of electricity and
harms those trying to control the fire.
(b) LPG is a better domestic fuel than wood
because it neither produces gases nor
residues that pollute the environment.
(c) The paper by itself catches fire easily
because its ignition temperature is low,
while a piece of paper wrapped around
an aluminium pipe does not catch fire,
because its ignition temperature rises as
some heat is absorbed by the aluminium
foil.
Q. 2. Describe the various zones of a candle flame.
Ans. A candle flame has three zones :
(a) The inner-most zone—It is also called
black zone. It indicates the deposition
of unburnt carbon particles in this zone.
It is the least hot region.
For diagram refer Ans. 3. SA-I
(b) The middle zone—Here partial
combustion takes place and wax
vapours start burning with yellow
flame. This part is moderately hot. It is
also called luminous zone. Carbon
particles formed burn with yellow
flame.
(c) The outer zone—It is the outer zone of

complete combustion. It is the hottest
and non-luminous zone. The wax burns
here completely and produces carbon
dioxide.
Q. 3. Explain the harmful effects of burning fuels.
Ans. The harmful effects of burning fuels :
(a) Fuels like wood, coal, petroleum etc.
which are carbon fuels, produce
unburnt carbon particles, which cause
respiratory diseases (asthma) and skin
diseases.
(b) Generally CO 2 is released during
burning of fuels. It causes the rise in the
temperature of the atmosphere of Earth,
which is called global warm-ing.
(c) Incomplete combustion of fuel releases
many poisonous gases such as carbon
monoxide. It can kill people sleeping in
a room containing carbon monoxide.
(d) Combustion of coal and diesel generates
sulphur dioxide. It is a corrosive gas and
it causes suffocation.
(e) Burning of fuels releases oxides of
nitrogen and sulphur. They dissolve in
rain water and form acid. Such rain is
called acid rain. It is harmful to crops,
buildings and soil.

Value Based Questions (3 marks)
Q. 1. Uneducated and careless people are not
aware of saving fossil fuels, such as, coal and
petroleum. Discuss some points how you can
make them aware regarding this ?
Ans. All fossil fuels are in limited quantity. Thus
we need a very judicious use of these fuels.
For this, we must find out some alternative

sources of energy as solar energy, water energy,
geothermal energy etc. We must ask them to
reduce unnecessary use of vehicles i.e., If four
people are going from one place to single

A great variety of plants and animals exist on the earth. They are essential for the well-being and
survival of mankind.
A major threat to survival of these organism is deforestation.
Trees in the forest are cut for some of the purposes mentioned below :
— Producing land for cultivation.
— Building houses and factories.
— Making furniture or using wood as fuel.
— Natural calamities, causing, forest fires and sever droughts.
The increase in temperature on the earth disturbs the water cycle and may reduce rainfall, causing
droughts.
Eroded soil has less humus and is less fertile. Gradually the fertile land gets converted into deserts.
It is called desertification.
Biosphere is that part of the earth in which living organism exist or which supports life.
Biological diversity refers to the variety of organims existing on the earth, their inter- relationships
with the environment.
To protect our flora and fauna and their habitats, protected areas are called sancturies, national park
and biosphere reserves are formed.
Sanctuaries : Areas where animals are protected from any disturbances to them and their habitats.
National Park : The areas reserved for wildlife where they can freely use the habitats and natural
resources.
Biosphere reserve : Large areas of protected land for conservation of wild life animals, plants and
traditional life of the tribals living in the area.
The plant and animals found in a particular area are termed as flora and fauna of that area.
Endemic species are those species of plants and animals which are found exclusively in a particular
area.
Species are a group of population that are capable of interbreeding.
Wildlife sanctuaries provide protection and suitable living conditions to wild animals, where killing
(Poaching) or capturing of animals is strictly prohibited.
National parks are large area to protect whole set of ecosystems. They protect flora, fauna, land space
and historical object of that area. Satpura National Park is the first reserve forest of India. The finest
teak is found in this forest.
Project tiger was launched by the government to protect tigers in the country.

Cell is the basic structural and functional unit of living organisms.
Robert Hooke in 1665 observed slices of cork under a simple magnifying device. He observed cells in
the cork.
The egg of a hen represents a single cell, and can be seen by naked eye.
Cell can be seen by Microscope.
Organisms made of more than one cell are called multicellular organisms.
A single celled organism is called unicellular. e.g., Amoeba, Protozoa.
A single celled organism performs all the functions such as digest food, respires, excretes, grow and
reproduction within the cell.
Group of cells performing same function is called tissue.
Shape and size of the cell depends on the function performed by it.
Generally, cells are round, spherical, or elongated. Some cells are long and pointed at both the ends.
They are spindle shaped. Some are long and branched like nerve cells.
Components of the cell are enclosed in a membrane. It provides shape to the cells of plants and animals.
Plant cells have additional covering called cell wall.

[ 51

The smallest cell is 0.1 to 0.5 micrometre in bacteria. The largest cell measuring 170 mm
× 130 mm is the egg of an ostrich.
A tissue is a group of similar cells performing a specific function.
Tissue makes organ and organs make organ system organ system performs different functions such
as digestion, assimilation and absorption.
Parts of the Cell
(a) Cell membrane : The cytoplasm and nucleus are enclosed within the membrane. It is also called
the plasma membrane. It is porous and allows the movement of substance or material both
inward and outward.
(b) Cytoplasm : The jelly like substance between the nucleus and the membrane is called cytoplasm.
(c) Cell wall : An outer thick layer in cells of plants is called cell wall.
(d) Organelles : Various other components of cells are present in the cytoplasm. These are
mitochondria, golgi bodies, ribosomes etc called cell organelles.
(e) Nucleus : The central dense round body in the centre is called the nucleus. Nucleus is separated
from the cytoplasm by a membrane called the nuclear membrane. It is also porous. It has a
smaller spherical body called nucleolus. Nucleus contains thread like structures called
chromosomes. These carry genes and helps in inheritance or transfer of characters from the
parents to the offsprings.
Cells are divided into :
(i) Prokaryotic cells : The cells having nuclear material without the nuclear membrane.
(ii) Eukaryotic cells : The cells having well organized nucleus with nuclear membrane.
(f) Vacuole : Plant cells have large vacuole whereas animal cells have small vacuoles.
(g) Plastids : Plastids are found in plant cells. They are of different colours. Some of them contain green
pigment called chlorophyll. Green coloured plastids are called chloroplasts.

REPRODUCTION

IN

ANIMALS

Quick Review


(a)

Reproduction is essential for the continuation of a species. It is a process by which animals can
reproduce by themselves and of their own kinds.
There are two modes of animal reproduction :
(a) Sexual reproduction
(b) Asexual reproduction.
Sexual Reproduction : This type of reproduction begins from the fusion of male and female gametes
is called sexual reproduction.
Male reproductive organs :
— The male reproductive organs include a pair of testes, two sperm ducts and a penis.
— Testes produce male gametes called sperms.
— Sperms are very small in size, has a head, a middle piece and a tail. It is a single cell.

Fig. : Male Reproductive Organ
Fig. : Human Sperm
Female reproductive organs :
— The female reproductive organs are a pair of ovaries, oviduct (fallopian tube) and uterus.
— The ovary produces female gametes called ova (eggs). It is a single cell.

Fig. : Human Sperm

REPRODUCTION IN ANIMALS

[ 57

— Uterus is the part where development of the baby takes place.
Fertilization
— Fusion of the egg and sperm is called fertilization. This results in the formation of fertilized egg
or Zygote.
— When fertilization takes place in the female body, it is called internal fertilization. e.g., cows,
dogs, Humans.



Fig. : Human ovum
— When fertilization takes place outside the body of the female, it is called external fertilization
e.g., Frog, Fishes.
Development of Embryo
— Fertilization results in zygote. Zygote begins to develop into embryo.

Fig. : Fertilization
— These cells begin to form groups that develop into different tissues and organs
— This developed structure is called embryo.
— Embryo continues to develop in the uterus.

Fig. : Zygote
— The stage of the embryo in which all the body parts can be identified is called a foetus.
— When development of foetus is complete, the mother gives birth to a baby.

Viviparous and Oviparous Animals
— The animals that give birth to young ones are called viviparous animals. e.g., cat, dog, etc.
— The animals which lay eggs are called oviparous animals. e.g., Hen, Duck, Birds etc.
Young ones to adults
Life cycle of silk worm
Egg  Larva or Caterpillar  Pupa  Adult.
The transformation of the larva into an adult occurs through drastic changes, called metamorphosis.
Asexual Reproduction : A type of reproduction in which 8 single parent is involved, is called asexual
reproduction. Some methods of asexual reproduction are :
— Budding (Hydra)
— Binary fission (Amoeba).
Story of Dolly, the Clone
— Cloning is the production of an exact copy of a cell, any other living part, or a complete organism.
— It was first successfully performed by Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute in
Edinburg, Scotland. They cloned a sheep named Dolly. Dolly was born on 5th July, 1996 and died
on 14th Feburary, 2003.

Short Answer Type Questions—I (2 marks)
Q. 2. Amoeba reproduces by which process ?
Explain in brief.
Ans. Amoeba reproduces by asexual reproduction,
binary fission. It begins the process of
reproduction by the division of its nucleus in
two nuclei. This is followed by division of its
body into two, where each part receives a
nucleus. Finally two amoebae are produced
from one parent amoeba.
2
Q. 3. What is Metamorphosis ?
(NCERT)
Ans. The transformation of the larva into an adult
through drastic changes is called
metamorphosis.
2
Q. 4. Write difference between viviparous and
oviparous animals.
Ans. Difference between viviparous and
oviparous :
Viviparous



The animals that give
birth to young ones
are called viviparous
animals. e.g., Human
beings, Cats, dogs.

Oviparous
The animals that lay
eggs are called
oviparous animals.
e.g., Frogs, fishes.

Q. 5. How is egg formed in the hen ?
Ans. After fertilization, the zygote divides
repeatedly and travels down the oviduct. As
it travels down, many protective layers are
formed around it. The hard shell is formed

60 ]

OSWAAL CBSE Question Bank Chapterwise Solutions, Science-VIII

around the developing embryo. The hen
finally lays the egg. 2
Q. 6. Write difference between internal
fertilization and external fertilization.
(NCERT)
Ans.

External
Fertilization

Internal
fertilization
Fertilization that
takes place inside
the female body is
called internal fertilization.
e.g., Human, cats,
Dogs.

Fertilization
in
which the fusion of a
male and a female
gamete takes place
outside the body of
the female is called
extenal fertilization.
e.g., fish, star fish etc.

2
Q. 7. What is IVF ?
Ans. IVF is In-vitro fertilization. In such cases the
doctor collects freshly released egg and sperm
and keep them together for a few hours for
fertilization. When fertilization occurs, the
zygote is formed and allowed to develop for
about a week and then, it is placed in the


mother’s uterus. Babies born through this
technique are called test-tube baby.
2
Q. 9.
Explain the structure of male reproductive
system in human beings.
Ans.
Male reproductive system : The male
reproductive organs include a pair of testes,
two sperm ducts and a penis. The testes
produce the male gametes called sperms.
Millions of sperms are produced by the testes.

Short Answer Type Questions—II (3 marks)

Q. 2. Why the new individual inherits some
characteristics from the mother and some
from the father ?
Ans. The process of fertilization is the meeting of
an egg cell from the mother and a sperm cell
from the father. So the new individual inherits
some characteristics from the mother and
some from the father.
3
Q. 3. How does external fertilization takes place ?
Explain with an example.

Ans. Fertilization in which the fusion of a male and
a female gamete takes place outside the body
of a female is called external fertilization. It is
very common in aquatic animals. During
spring or rainy season, frogs and toads move
to ponds and slow flowing streams. When the
male and female come together in water, the
female lays hundreds of eggs. A layer of jelly
holds the eggs together and provides
protection to the eggs. The male deposits
sperm over them. The sperms come in contact
with the eggs. This results in fertilization.
(2+1=3)
Q. 4. Why do fishes and frogs lay eggs in hundreds ?
Ans. This is because the eggs and sperms get
exposed to water movement, wind and rainfall.
There are other animals in the pond, which
may feed on eggs. Thus production of large
number of eggs and sperms is necessary to
ensure fertilization of atleast a few of them. 3
Q. 5. Define asexual reproduction. Describe two
methods of asexual reproduction. (NCERT)
Ans. Reproduction in which only a single parent is
involved is called asexual reproduction. Two
methods of asexual reproduction. (1+2=3)

REPRODUCTION IN ANIMALS

[ 61

(a) Budding
(b) Binary fission
(a) Budding : In hydra there may be one or
more bulges. These bulges are developing
new individuals and they are called
buds. When new individuals develop
from the buds, it is called budding.

(b) Binary fission : The process of
reproduction by the division of its
nucleus into two nuclei. This is followed
by division of its body into two where
each part receives a nucleus as it finally
two amoebae are produced.

Long Answer Type Questions (5 marks)
Q. 1. Explain the process of reproduction in
human beings with suitable diagrams.
Ans. Reproduction in human beings : In human,
internal reproduction takes place. There are
two sexes in human beings—male & female.
Male reproductive parts include a pair of
testes, two sperm ducts and a penis. The testes
produce the sperms. The female reproductive
organs are a pair of ovaries, oviduct and the
Uterus

Ovary
Zygote

Fig. Reproduction in Human Beings
uterus. The ovary produces female gametes
called ova. Fusion of the egg and the sperm is
called fertilization. This results in the
formation of a fertilized egg or zygote. Zygote

begins to develop into an embryo. The zygote
repeatedly gives rise to a ball of cells. The cells
then begin to form groups and organs of the
body which form embryo. The stage of the
embryo in which all the body parts can be
identified is called foetus. When the
development of the foetus is complete, the
mother gives birth to the baby.
Q. 2. What are clones ? What are the various steps of
this process ? Explain with examples.
Ans. Cloning is the production of an exact copy of
a cell; any other living part, or a complete
organism. Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at
the Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, Scotland
successfully cloned a sheep named Dolly.
Following steps were involved in cloning :
1. A cell was collected from the mammary
gland of a female Finn Dorset sheep.
2. An egg was obtained from a Scottish black
face ewe and its nucleus was removed.
3. The nucleus from the mammary gland cell
of Dorset sheep was introduced in the egg.
4. This egg was then implanted in the uterus.

Value Based Questions (5 marks)
Q. 1. We hear and read about female foeticide,
which is really a wrong practice. In some
families, be it rural or urban, females are
tortured for giving birth to a girl child. They
do not seem to understand the scientific
reason behind the birth of a boy or a girl. In
your opinion, the approach of the society
towards mother in this regard is correct or
not ?
Ans. In rural and uneducated families till today in
India female foeticide is a common practice.

The females are blamed forgiving birth to a
female or girl child. But as per truth and
scientific reason the sex of the child is
determined by the male as they have XY
chromosomes and female body have XX
chromosome. If male produces X chromosome
the born child will be female and if they
produce Y chromosome male child will be
born. Hence, we must educate the citizens
regarding this through lectures, campaigns
etc.

REACHING THE AGE
OF ADOLESCENCE
Quick Review






The period of life, when the body undergoes changes, leading to reproductive maturity is called
adolescence.
Adolescence begins around the age of 11 and lasts upto 18 or 19 years of age. Those who come under
this age group are called teenagers.
The human body undergoes several changes during adolescence. These changes mark the onset of
puberty.
Changes at Puberty :
— Calculation for full height (Formula)

Present height (cm)
 100.
% of full height at this age
(% of full height is calculated as given in the chart.)
Generally girls grow faster than boys but by about 18 years of age, both reach their maximum heights.

— Change in Body Shape : Changes occurring in adolescent boys and girls are different. In boys,
shoulders generally broaden, muscles of body grow. In girls, the region below waist becomes
wider.
— Change in voice : At puberty the voice box or larynx begins to grow. In boys Adam’s apple (Protruding
part of the throat) is seen and their voice box becomes larger. Girls have high pitched voice.
— Increased activity of Sweat and Sebaceous Glands : Increased activity of these glands causes
acne and pimples on the face at this time.

— Development of Sex Organs : At this age, male sex organs such as penis, testes are completely
developed. Testes begin to produce sperms.
In girls ovaries enlarge and start releasing mature eggs.
Reaching Mental, Intellectual and Emotional Maturity.
Intellectual development takes place and they spend considerable time in thinking.
Secondary Sexual Characters : In boys, testes produce sperms, boys begin to grow facial hair, on their
chest, hair grow under the arm and in the region above the thighs or the pubic region. These are called
secondary sexual characters. Male sex hormone testosterone is secreted at the onset of puberty.
In girls, ova are formed. Breasts begins to develop, hair grows under arms and in the region above the
thighs or the pubic region. The female sex hormone estrogen is released.
Release of sex horomones is controlled by the pituitary gland.
Endocrine glands release hormones into the blood stream to reach a particular body part called target
site. It responds to the hormones.
In female, the reproductive phase of life begins at puberty and generally lasts till the age of 45 to 50
years. Ovum matures and if fertilization does not occur, the released egg and the thickened lining of
the uterus along with blood is shed off and is called menstruation. It occurs once in 28 to 30 days. The
first flow is termed as menarche and stoppage phase is called menopause.
Sex Determination (Boy/Girl)
Sex chromosome present in the nucleus of sperm and ova determines the sex in human beings. Pair of
sex chromosomes in female is XX and in male is XY. When sperm carrying X chromosome fuses with
ova the child will be a female. Whereas when sperm carrying Y chromosoms fuses with ova the child
will be a male.
Other Hormones :
Thyroid gland — Thyroxine
Adrenal gland — Adrenaline
Pancreas — Insulin.
Reproductive Health.
The diet for an adolescent has to be carefully planned. He/she should take a balanced diet.
Personal Hygiene : For teenagers because the increased activity of sweat glands sometime makes
body smelly. All parts of the body should be washed and cleaned properly everyday.
Physical Exercise : Walking and playing in fresh air keeps the body fit and healthy.
Say ‘No’ to Drugs : If you take some drugs, just say ‘No’ Unless it is prescribed by the doctor. Drugs
are addictive. They ruin health and happiness both.

Q. 2. What is menstruation ? Explain.
(NCERT)
Ans. In a woman, during the reproductive age, one
ovum matures and is released by one of the
ovaries once in about 28 to 30 days. During

REACHING THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE


this period, the wall of uterus becomes thick
so as it receives the fertilized egg. If fertilization
does not occur, the egg and the thickened
lining of uterus along with its blood vessels
are sheded off. This causes bleeding in
women, and is called menstruation.

At puberty, the larynx begins to grow. Boys
develop larger voice boxes. The growing voice
box in boys can be seen as a protruding part
of the throat called Adam’s apple.
2
Q. 3.
What are secondary sexual characters ?
(NCERT)
Ans.
During puberty in girls, breasts begin to
develop and boys begin to grow facial hair
that is, moustaches and beard. Boys also
develop hair on their chest. In both boys and
girls, hair grows under the arms and in the
region above the thighs or the pubic region.
They are called secondary sexual characters.

Pregnancy ?
Ans. In our country, the legal age for marriage is 18

years for girls and 21 years for boys. This is
because teenage mothers are not prepared
mentally or physically for motherhood. Early
marriage and motherhood cause health
problems in the mother and the child.
2
Q. 3.
What happens due to increased activity of
sweat and sebaceous glands ?
Ans.
During puberty, the secretion of sweat glands
and sebaceous glands (Oil glands) increases.
Many young people get acne and pimples on
the face due to the increased activity of these
glands in the skin.
2
Q. 3.
What is target site ?
Ans.
Endocrine glands release hormones into the
blood stream to reach a particular body part
called target site.

Two myths occur during adolescence are.
(i) A girl gets pregnant if she looks at boys
during menstruation.
(ii) A girl should not be allowed to work in the
kitchen during menstruation.
2
Q. 3.
What an adolescent must do for personal
hygiene ?
Ans.
For personal hygiene an adolescent should have
a bath at least once every day, because increased
activity of sweat glands makes body smelly. If
clealiness is not maintained there can be bacterial
infection. Girl should take special care of
cleanliness during the time of menstrual flow. 2

Short Answer Type Questions—II (3 marks)
Q. 1. What are sex hormones ? Why are they named
so ? State their functions.
(NCERT)
Ans. Hormones that control the changes occurring
in the body during adolescence are called sex
hormones. The male sex hormone testosterone
is secreted by testes while female sex hormone
estrogen is secreted by ovary.
Testosterone causes development of secondary
sexual characters in boys such as broadening
of chest, growth of hair on face and other parts
of the body, enlargement of larynx etc.
Estrogen makes the breasts develop, milk
secreting glands develop inside the breast. 3
Q. 2. What is the function of pituitary gland ?
Ans. Pituitary gland exerts hormonal control over
testes and ovary which secrete their own
hormone testosterone and estrogen
respectively. These hormones help in the
development of secondary sexual characters
during adolescence. Pituitary gland also
secretes another hormone called growth
hormone that helps in growth of body.
3

Q. 3. Write a short note on nutritional needs of the
adolescents.
Ans. Adolescence is a stage of rapid growth and
development. Hence, the diet for an adolescent
has to be carefully planned. They should be
provided a balanced diet, which means that
meal should include proteins, carbohydrates,
fats and vitamins in requisite proportions, e.g.,
Milk is a balanced food itself. Fruits provide
nourishment. Iron builds blood and iron rich
food such as leafy vegetables, jaggery, meat,
citrus, indian gooseberry are good for
adolescents.
3
Q. 4. What is the role of hormones in completing
the life history of frogs ?
Ans. In the life cycle of frog the tadpole passes
through certain stages to become a frog. It is
controlled by thyroxine, the hormone
produced by thyroid. It requires the presence
of iodine water. If water in which tadpoles are
growing does not contain sufficient iodine,
the tadpoles cannot become adults.

Q. 5. Name the disease or side effects caused by
deficiency of following hormones :
(a) Thyroxine
(b) Insulin
(c) Adrenaline
(d) Growth hormone.
Ans. (i) Thyroxine produced by thyroid gland. A
person was suffering from ‘goitre’ disease.
(ii) Person suffers from diabetes if pancreas
do not produce the hormone insulin in
sufficient quantities.
(iii) Adrenal glands produce hor mone
adrenaline, which helps the body to
adjust to stress, when a person is very
angry, embarrassed or worried.
(iv) Pituitary gland secretes growth hormone
that is necessary for the normal growth of
a person.
3
Q. 6. How is the sex of the baby determined ?
Ans. The sex of the baby is determined by sex
chromosomes that are X and Y. In human
beings, the female have a pair of XX
chromosomes, where as a male body has one
‘X’ and ‘Y’ chromosome. When a sperm
containing ‘X’ chromosomes fertilizes the egg,
the zygote receives two X chromosomes and


develops into a female child. If the sperm
contributes a ‘Y’ chromosome to the egg at
fertilization the zygote develops into a male
child.

Q. 7.
How adolescence affects in reaching mental,
intellectual and emotional maturity ?
Ans.
Adolescence is also a period of change in a
person’s way of thinking. They are more
independent than before and are also self
conscious.
Intellectual development takes place and they
tend to spend considerable time in thinking.
It is time of one’s life when the brain has the
greatest capacity for learning. An adolescent
may feel insecure while trying to adjust to the
changes in the body and mind.

Q. 7.
Why is pituitary gland called ‘master
Gland’ ?
Ans.
It is called so as it is the most important
endocrine gland. Its size is just equal to a small
pea. The normones secreted by pituitary gland
stimulate testes and overies to secrete their
hormones. It also regulates the activity of other
endocrine glands.

Q. 1. List all the changes that occur during puberty.
Explain in brief.
(NCERT)
Ans. The human body undergoes several changes
during adolescence. These changes mark the
onset of puberty. It ends when an adolescent
reaches reproductive maturity. The changes
taking place in the body are :
(i) Increase in height.
(ii) Change in body shape. The boys
shoulders become wider and in the girls
the region below the waist becomes
wider.
(iii) Change in voice—in the boys, the voice box
enlarges and can be seen as the protruding
part of the throat called Adam’s apple. In
girls, it is hardly visible.
(iv) Increased activity of sweat and sebaceous gland which may cause acne and
pimples.
(v) Sex organs develop fully and reach
maturity.
(vi) They also reach upto mental, intel-lectual
and emotional maturity.
(vii) Secondary sexual characters also
develope. For example, in male hair on
face, under arms. In girls, under arms and

hair grow above the thighs. (any five)
(1×5=5)
Q. 2. Explain reproductive phase of life in
humans.
Ans. Reproductive phase of life in humans :
Adolescents become capable of reproduction
when their testes and ovaries begin to produce
gametes. The hormone testosterone in male is
secreted by testes. In female, the reproductive
phase begins at puberty–10 to 12 yrs to 45-50
yrs.
The ovum matures and is released by one of
the ovaries once in 28 to 30 days. During this
period, the wall of the uterus becomes thick. If
it is fertilized, it results in pregnancy. If
fertilization does not occur, the eggs and the
thickened lining of the uterus along with
blood vessels is sheded off. This cause
menstruation. Sex is also determined by the
sex hormones X and Y. Male have ‘XY’
chromosomes and female have ‘XX’
chromosome in their body. The baby child will
be male if the sper m contributes ‘Y’
chromosome and child will be female if the
sperm releases ‘X’ chromosomes. Hence,
males are responsible for sex determination
in humans.

A push or a pull on an object is called a force.
Exploring Forces : Forces applied on an object in the same direction add to one another.
— If the two forces act in the opposite directions on an object, the net force acting on it is the
difference between the two forces.
— The strength of a force is usually expressed by its magnitude.
A force :
— May make an object move from rest.
— May change the speed of an object if it is moving.
— May change the direction of motion of an object.
— May bring about a change in the shape of an object.
— May cause some or all of these effects.
Force can be of two types :
Contact Force
Non-Contact Force
Muscular force
Magnetic force
Frictional force
Gravitational force
Mechanical force
Electrostatic force.
The force responsible for changing the state of motion of objects is the force of friction. It always
acts on all the moving bodies and its direction is always opposite to the direction of motion.
The force acting on a unit area of a surface is called pressure.
Pressure = Force/Area.
Liquid and gases exert pressure on the walls of the container.
The pressure exerted by air around us is known as atmospheric pressure.

Short Answer Type Questions—I (2 marks)
Q. 1. What is the state of motion ? How does it
changes the state of an object ?
Ans. The state of motion of an object is described
by its speed and the direction of motion. An
object may be at rest or in motion, both are
its state of motion. It can be changed by
acting of force on that object.

Q. 6. Why cutting vegetables with a blunt knife
is not easier ?

Ans. Because of the larger area, smaller the
pressure means blunt knife have large area
instead of sharp knife. So less pressure will
be on vegetable which makes it tough to cut. 2
Q. 7. Why is it easy to fix the pointed nail into
wooden plank ?
Ans. Because the area of the pointed end of the
nail is much smaller than that of its head.
The same force, therefore, produces a
pressure sufficient to push the pointed end
of the nail into the wooden plank.

Q. 8. How can you can prove that pressure is
exerted by liquids ?
Ans. Take a transparent glass tube. The length of
tube should be about 15 cm. Take a thin sheet
of a good rubber. Stretch the rubber and fix
tightly over one end of the pipe. Hold the
tube in vertical position. Pour water in it. The
rubber sheet bulges out. This bulging is due
to the pressure exerted by water. Hence it is
proved.

Q. 3. What is atmospheric pressure ? How can
we get an idea about the magnitude of
atmospheric pressure ?
Ans. The envelop of air surrounding the earth is
known as the atmosphere. The pressure
exerted by this air is known as atmospheric
pressure. The magnitude of atmospheric
pressure can be felt by following experiment.
Take a good quality rubber sucker. Press it
hard on a smooth plane surface. When we
press the sucker, most of the air between its
cup and surface escapes out. The sucker
sticks to the surface because the pressure of
atmosphere acts on it. To pull the sucker off
the surface, the applied force should be large.
This activity might give you an idea about
the magnitude of atmospheric pressure. 3

Q. 1. Experimentally explain that pressure is
exerted by liquid and gases on the wall of
the containers.
Ans. Pressure exerted by liquid and gases on the
wall of container can be explained by the
following experiments.
Take a plastic bottle. Fix a cylindrical glass
tube (a few cms long) near its bottom. Make
sure that the water does not leak from the
joint. Cover the mouth of glass tube with a
thin rubber sheet. Fill the bottle upto half with
water. The bulging of the rubber sheet in the
case indicates that water exerts pressure on
the sides of container or we can say that
liquid exerts pressure on the walls of
container.
In the case of gas, when we inflate a balloon
the balloon will be filled with air and air
exerts pressure and its shape has changed.
So we find that gases, too, exert pressure on
the walls of their container.

Q. 2. What are contact and non-contact forces ?
Explain briefly with suitable examples.
Ans. Forces can be of two types :
1. Contact forces.
2. Non-contact forces.
(1) Contact forces : The forces that come
into play when two objects come in contact
with each other.

(a)

Muscular force : The force which is
exerted due to action of muscles is
known as the muscular force. e.g.,
running, bending, walking etc.
(b) Frictional Force : The force respoonsible
for changing the state of motion of an
object. Equal and opposite forces are
being exerted on an object when its
surface comes in contact with other
surface. e.g., a car or scooter comes to
rest.
(2) Non-contact forces : The forces that can
be exerted from a distance without
establishing a contact are called the noncontact forces.
(a) Magnetic force : Force exerted by a
magnet on another magnet or magnetic
substance like iron is called magnetic
force.
(b) Electrostatic force : Force exerted by a
charged body on another charged body
or uncharged body is called electrostatic
force. e.g., If we rub a comb with hair and
bring it near some small bits of paper it
attracts the bits of paper towards itself.
This is electrostatic force.
(c) Force of gravity : The earth pulls every
freely falling object towards its centre.
The force exerted by the Earth is called
the force of gravity.

FRICTION
Quick Review


Any object, moving over the surface of another object, slows down when no external force is
applied on it. This is due to the force of friction.



Friction depends on the nature of surfaces in contact.
— Force of friction is less on smooth surfaces.
— Force of friction is greater on rough surfaces.



The force required to over come friction at the instant when an object starts moving from the rest
is a measure of static friction.





The force required to keep the object moving at a given speed is a measure of sliding friction.



Rolling friction : When one body rolls over the surface of another body, the resistance to its motion
is called rolling friction.



Fluid friction : Fluids exert force of friction on objects in motion through them.
The frictional force exerted by fluids is also called drag.




Sliding friction is slightly less than static friction.



The frictional force on an object in a fluid depends on
(a) its speed with respect to the fluid.
(b) the shape of the object.
(c) the nature of the fluid.



To overcome drag, objects are provided with special shape called streamline. For e.g., shape of an
aeroplane, bird etc.



Action of lubricant : It avoids interlocking of irregularities on the two surfaces in contact with each
other. e.g., grease, oil etc.

Friction is a necessary evil that makes us walk, write, hold things etc.
Increasing and reducing friction :
— Friction can be increased by making the contact surface rough. e.g., the treaded tyres of cars,
trucks, provide better grip with the ground.
— When it is needed to reduce the friction, the contact surface is smoothened or the substances
which reduce friction called lubricants, are used.

Factors affecting friction :
(a) It depends on nature of surfaces in contact.
(b) More between rough surfaces and less between smooth surfaces.
(c) It depends on how hard the two surfaces press together.
(d) It is independent on the area of contact.

Q. 8. When does rolling friction come into play ?
Ans. When a body rolls on other body, rolling
friction comes into play.
2
Q. 9. Name two methods of reducing friction with
examples.
Ans. Two methods of reducing friction :
(1) Rolling : The rolling wheels attached to
luggage bags make it comfortable for
passengers to carry them because rolling reduces friction and is smaller than
sliding friction.
(2) Sliding : By polishing surfaces or by
applying a lubricant.
(1+1=2)
Q. 10. What does frictional force exerted on an
object in a fluid depend on ?
Ans. Frictional force on an object in a field
depends on the speed with respect to the fluid
and the nature of fluid. It also depends on
the shape of the object. e.g., all vehicles are
designed to have shapes that reduce fluid
friction. Shape of boats and ships is
streamlined.

Q. 2. You spill a bucket of soapy water on a
marble floor accidently. Would this make it
easier or more difficult for you to walk on
the floor ? Why ?
(NCERT)
Ans. A bucket of soapy water spills on a marble
floor accidently. It is difficult to walk on it.
The soap on floor reduces the friction and
the foot is unable to make a proper grip on
the floor and it starts glippind on the floor.
3
Q. 3. Explain why sportsmen use shoes with
spikes.
(NCERT)
Ans. Sports men use shoes with spike to increase
the friction so that the shoes do not slip while
they run or play.
3
Q. 4. Explain why objects moving in fluids must
have special shapes.
(NCERT)
Ans. When objects move through fluids, they have
to overcome friction acting on them. In this
process they lose energy. Objects are given
special shapes that would make them lose
less energy in over-coming friction. Stream
lined shape is the shape that overcomes the
friction of fluid easily.
3

Q. 5. Explain why sliding friction is less than
static friction.
(NCERT)
Ans. Sliding friction is always less than static
friction. As two sliding objects find less time
to get interlocked against each other, so they
get less friction.
3
Q. 6. Mention three examples that show that
friction produces heat.
Ans. Following examples show that friction
produces heat :
(a) Warming of our palms when we rub them.
(b) Jar of mixer becomes hot when it runs.
(c) Warming of the parts of a machine when
it is operated.
(1+1+1=3)
Q. 7. Friction is called a necessary evil. Why ?
Ans. Friction is called a necessary evil because we
cannot do anything without friction and it
also shows effects. No movement would come
to an end without friction. No body would
rest without friction. We cannot write with
pen or pencil if there is no friction. If an object

Long Answer Type Questions (5 marks)
Q. 1. Give examples to show that friction is both
a friend and a foe.
Ans. Friction is a friend because :
(i) we can not write with pen or pencil, if
there is no friction.
(ii) we are unable to write on the black
board with a chalk.
(iii) if an object starts moving, it would never
stop.
(iv) the vehicles cannot be started or
stopped.
(v) we cannot fix a nail on the wall or tie
a knot without friction
Friction as foe because :
(i) it wears out materials whether they are
screws, ball bearings.
(ii) the shoes wear out due to friction.
(iii) friction also produces heat. When a
machine is operated, heat is generated
that causes wastage of energy.
(iv) the tyres of cars, buses and trucks etc
also wear out due to friction.

(v) Friction reduces the speed due to which
more force is required.

Q. 2. Discuss the various ways to reduce the
friction.
Ans. Friction may be reduced in the following
ways :
(1) Polishing the surface : We polish the
rubbing surfaces to reduce their
unevenness and make them smooth.
(2) Lubricating the surface : To reduce
friction in order to increase efficiency
when oil, grease or graphite is applied
between the moving parts of a machine,
a thin layer is formed there and moving
surfaces do not directly rub against each
other. These substances are lubricants
which reduce the friction.
(3) Using wheels and ball bearings : By
using wheels and ball bearing we
convert sliding friction into rolling
friction. This reduces friction between the
two contact surfaces and helps us to save
energy, effort and time.

(4) Streamlining : Objects are to given
special shapes, such as streamlined body
to aeroplanes. Their bodies shapes them
and make them lose less energy in
overcoming friction. Hence, all vehicles
are designed to have shapes that reduce
fluid friction.

Q. 3. Name the factors that affect friction.

Ans. Factors affecting friction :
(a) It depends on the nature of surfaces in
contact.
(b) It is more between rough surfaces and
less between smooth surfaces.

Sound is a form of energy.
Sound is produced by a vibrating body.
To and fro or back and forth motion of an object is called vibration.
Sound is produced by humans through the voice box or the larynx. It is situated at the upper end
of the wind pipe. Two vocal cords, are stretched across the voice box and have a narrow slit between
them. When the lungs force air through the slit, the vocal cords vibrate and produce sound.
Sound needs a medium for propagation.
We hear sound through our ears.
Amplitude is the maximum distance from mean position. Loudness of sound depends upon its
amplitude.
Time period : The time taken by a vibrating body to complete one oscillation.
Frequency is the number of oscillations per second. The SI unit of frequency is Hertz.
The frequency determines the shrillness or pitch of a sound. Usually male has low pitched (bass)
sound and female has high pitched sound (shrill).
20 Hz to 20,000 Hz is audible sound for human beings. Sound less than 20 Hz frequency is called
infrasonic sound and sound more than 20 kHz is called ultrasonic sound.
Unpleasant sound called noise may cause health problems to humans beings.
Noise pollution : Televisions, transistors, radios at high volumes, desert coolers, air conditioners,
horn of vehicles etc. cause noise pollution.
Measures to limit noise pollution : Silence devices must be installed in aircraft engines, transport
vehicles etc. Trees must be planted along the roads and around buildings to cut down on the
sound.

We hear sound through our ears. The human ear has three main parts :
(a) Outer ear : It has a canal at the end of which is a stretched membrane called eardrum. The
sound waves pass through ear canal and eardrum to vibrate.
(b) Middle ear : It has a set of three bones that are linked together and attached to the eardrum.
These bones receive vibrations from eardrum and pass on to the inner ear.
(c) Inner ear : The inner ear receives vibrations from the middle ear and changes them into nerve
impulses that are interpreted by the brain and we hear the sound.
If v = velocity of sound wave, n = frequency of sound wave, = wavelength of sound wave.
then
v = n
Maximum speed of sound is in solids, followed by liquids and then in gases.

Q. 2. What is hearing impairment ? How do people
over come this problem ?
Ans. Hearing impairment means not able to hear
properly. Partial disability is generally the
result of a disease, injury or age. Children
with impaired hearing need special care by
learning sign language. Technological
devices for the hearing impaired have made
it possible for such person to improve their
quality of life.
3
Q. 3. What is frequency ? How does it affect the
quality of sounds ?
Ans. The number of oscillations per second is
called frequency. Its unit is Hertz. Frequency
determines the shrillness of sounds. It is also
called pitch of sound. The high frequency
makes the high pitch and if the pitch is low,
the frequency is less. High pitched sound
(females) is shrill whereas low pitched sound
(males) is hoarse. 3
Q. 4. (a) Define an oscillation ?
(b) Hertz

Ans. (a) Oscillation : The to and fro motion of an
object is called vibration. This motion is also
called oscillatory motion. (b) The number of
oscillations per second is called the
frequency in Hertz (Hz). A frequency of 1
Hz is one oscillation per second. (1½+1½=3)
Q. 5. What do you mean by vacuum ? What
happens to the loudness of sound in
vacuum ?
Ans. The decreasing amount of air decreases
loudness of sound. When air is removed
completely from a vessel, it is said that there
is a vacuum. If all air is sucked from the
vessel the sound would stop completely. The
sound cannot travel through a vacuum.

CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF
ELECTRIC CURRENT
Quick Review



Some liquids are good conductors of electricity and some are poor conductors.



LED (Light Emitting Diodes) can be used in place of electric bulb in the tester. LED glows even
if a weak electric current flows through it.



Distilled water is a poor conductor of electricity. Impure water or salt dissolved water can conduct
electricity.



The passage of an electric current through a conducting solution causes chemical reaction. As a
result bubbles of gas may be formed on the electrodes. Deposits can also be seen on electrodes.



Electroplating is the process of depositing a layer of any desired metal on another material by
means of electricity.




Electroplating is widely used in industries for coating one metal object with another metals.

The heating effect of current, the filament of bulb gets heated and starts glowing. If current is weak,
the filament does not get heated and it does not glow.

[ 89

Q. 2. The bulb does not glow in the setup shown.
List the possible reasons. Explain your
answer.
(NCERT)

Ans. The bulb does not glow due to the following
reasons :
(i) Bulb may be fused.
(ii) Liquid is non-conducting.
(iii) Cells may be used up.
(iv) Connections of the circuit may be loose.
2
Q. 3. Does pure water conduct electricity ? If not,
what can we do to make it conducting ?
(NCERT)
Ans. Pure water is bad conductor of electricity. To
make it conducting, some salt may be added
into water. The dissolved salt makes it a good
conductor of electricity.
2
Q. 4. Is it safe for the electrician to carry out
electrical repair outdoors during heavy
down pour ? Explain.
(NCERT)
Ans. No, it is highly dangerous to carry out
electric repair out door during heavy down
pour because rain water and our body both
are highly conducting and electricity can
easily pass through. Thus, we experience
high shock and it may cause electrocution.
2
Q. 5. Paheli had heard that rain water is as good
as distilled water. Hence, she collected some
rain water using a tester. To her surprise
she found that the compass needle showed
deflection. What could be the reasons ?
(NCERT)
Ans. Paheli had heard a truth that rain water is
as good as distilled water. But the dissolved
impurities present in atmosphere enter into
it and makes it a good conductor. So, it shows
deflection when she checks it with a tester. 2
Q. 6. Prepare a list of objects around you that are
electroplated.
(NCERT)
Ans. Objects that are generally electro-plated are
as follows :
— Ornaments.
— Wheel rims of vehicles.
— Tin cans.
— Handles of vehicles.
— Electric decorative appliances.

— Kitchen gas burner.
— Fan blades.
— Pots of metals
— Utensils etc.
— Door and window handles.
2
Q. 7.
The ordinary water can conduct electricity
while distilled water can not. Explain why ?
Ans.
The ordinary water that we get from the tap,
river, lakes and ponds is not as pure as
distilled water. It contains so many impurities
in the form of salts. These impurities make it
good conductor of electricity. As distilled water
is free from salt, it is unable to conduct
electricity.
2
Q. 7.
Write a short note on LED.
Ans.
LEDs are Light Emitting Diodes. They are
used to check electric current. Even when a
weak electric current flows through it, they
glows. These are available in many colours
such as red, green, yellow, blue and white. LEO
has two wires, one is longer and the other is
shorter. Larger wire is connected with + ve
terminal and – ve to the shorter terminals. 2
Q. 7.
When do you need magnetic compass to
test the conduction of electricity ?
Ans.
If current is small, the bulb does not glow on
passing electric current through the tester.
Hence to check the small current we need
magnetic compass to test the conduction. 2
Q. 7.
Can some fruits and vegetables conduct
electricity ? Explain with an example.
Ans.
Some fruits and vegetables also conduct
electricity. It is explained with the following
example.


Potato

Short Answer Type Questions—II (3 marks)
Q. 1. Experimentally prove that solutions of acids,
bases and salts conduct electricity.
Ans. The solutions of acids, bases and salts
conduct electricity. This can be experimentally proved by following method :
— Take three clean plastic or rubber caps
of bottles.
— Pour about two teaspoon full of distilled
water in each of them.
— Add few drops of lemon juice in one cap.
— Add a few drops of as base as caustic
soda in second cap.
— Add little salt to third cap to form salt
solution.
— Now conduct electricity through each.
An electric current flows through all the
conducting solutions thus indicaning that
acids, bases and salts conduct electricity. 3
Q. 2. What are the chemical effects of electric
current ? Explain with an example.
Ans. Chemical effects of electric current can be
explained by following experiment :
— Take two carbon rods with metal caps.
Clean their metal cap.
Metal cap
Carbon rod

Carbon rod
Water

Fig. : Passing current through water
— Wrap copper wires around the metal
caps of the carbon rods and join them
to a battery.
— Pour a cup full of water in a glass bowl
and add a tea, spoon of salt.
— Immerse the electrodes in solution but
metal caps should be out of the water.
— Wait for 5 min.
— Observe the electrodes.
— The passage of an electric current
through a conducting solution causes
chemical reaction. As a result, bubbles
of gas are formed in the electrode.
Deposits of metal may be seen on
electrodes. Change of colour of solution
may occur. These are some of the
chemical effects of the electric current. 3
Q. 3. Discuss two methods of testing a conductor
or an insulator.
Ans. The following methods are used to test the
conduction :
(i) The conductivity of substance can be
checked by using electric bulb.
When the liquid between the two ends
of the tester allows the electric current to
pass, the circuit of the tester becomes
complete. The current flows in the circuit
and the bulb glows. If the circuit of tester
is not complete the bulb does not glow.
This method does not work when current
is very small.

Lemon Juice

Fig. : Testing Conduction of Electricity
(ii) We can use another effect of an electric
current to test the conduction. A
magnetic tester is also used to test
conductivity. When current is allowed
to pass through it, it creates a magnetic
field and the compass shows deflection.
The deflection of compass shows that
the current is passing through circuit.

SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA
Quick Review






Cyclones, tsunami, earthquakes, droughts, lightning etc., are some destructive natural phenomena.
Lightning is an electric spark, on a huge scale.
In 1752, Benjamin Franklin, an American scientist, showed that lightning and the spark from
clothes are essentially same phenomena.
— Rub a plastic with soft cotton cloth, It can attract very small pieces of paper.
— When a plastic refill is rubbed with polythene it attracts paper pieces.
In all the above activities the rubbed acquires a small electric charge. These objects are called
charged objects.
— There are two types of charges—positive charge and negative charge. Like charges repel and
unlike charges attract each other.
— It is a convention to call the charge acquired by a glass rod when it is rubbed with silk as positive.
The other kind of charge is said to be negative.
— A device can be used to test whether an object is carrying charge or not. This device is known as
electroscope.
— The process of transferring of charge from a charged object to the Earth is called earthing.
— Earthing is provided in a building to protect us from electrical shocks due to any leakage of
electric current.
— Lightning strike can destroy life and property.
Lightning conductor is a device used to protect tall buildings from the effect of lightning.
— Earthquakes : An earthquake is sudden shaking or trembling of the earth, which lasts for a very
short time.
— Earthquakes can cause floods, tsunami, landslides etc.
— The tremors are caused by the disturbance deep down inside the earth crust. The outermost layer
of the earth is not in one piece. It is fragmented and each fragment are called plate. These plates
are in continuous motion. When they brush past one another, they cause disturbance resulting in
an earthquake on the earth surface. The weak zones of the Earth plates are also known as Seismic
or Fault Zones.
— The power of an earthquake is expressed in terms of a magnitude on a scale called the Richter
scale.

The waves are recorded by an instrument
called the seismograph. This instrument is
simply a vibrating rod or a pendulum, which

starts vibrating when tremors occur. A pen
is attached to the vibrating system that
records the seismic waves on a paper. By
studying these waves, scientists can
construct a complete map of the earthquake. 3
Q. 4. Describe with the help of a diagram an
instrument which can be used to detect a
charged body.
(NCERT)
Ans. Electroscope is a device used to detect the
presence of charge on an object.
— It acts on the principle that like charges
repel each other and unlike charges
attract each other.
— An electroscope has a metal rod with
thin metal strip or leaf attached to its
bottom. At the top, the rod enters into
the glass box.
— Charge a refill and touch its top part.
When metal strips receive the same
charge from the charged refill, they repel
each other.
Metallic cup

Metal rod

Metal strips

Fig. Electroscope
— When they attract each other, it means
that a refill charge is opposite charge.
Hence, this device can be used to detect
whether an object is carrying charge or
not. Either they are same or opposite
charges.

Long Answer Type Questions (5 marks)
Q. 1. Explain protection against earthquake.
Ans. Protection against earthquakes :
Earthquakes cannot be predicted. They can
be highly destructive. It is, therefore,

important that we take necessary precautions
to protect ourselves all the time. It is advisable
to make the structure simple so that it is
‘Quake Safe’.

SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA

[ 97

— Consult qualified architects and
structural engineers.
— In highly seismic area, the use of mud
and timber is better. They keep roofs light.
— Fix shelves and cupboards to the walls.
— Be careful where you hang wall clocks,
photo frames, water heaters etc.
— Building can catch fire during earthquake. So all buildings, must have fire
fighting equipments in working order.
In the event that an earthquake does strike,
take the following steps to protect yourself.
At home : Take shelter under a table, stay
away from tall and heavy objects and if you
are in bed, do not get up. Protect your head
with a pillow.
Outdoors : Find a clean spot, away from
buildings, trees, and over headed power lines,
Drop to ground. If you are in car or bus do
not come out.
5

Q. 2. Explain the mechanism of thunder storms.
Ans. Mechanism of thunderstrom or the story of
lightning : During the development of a
thunderstorm, the air current moves up-

wards while the water droplets move
downwards. These vigorous movement cause
separation of charges. By a process, the
positive charges collect near the upper edges
of the clouds and the negative charges
accumulate near the lower edges. There is
accumulation of the charges near the ground
also. When the magnitude of accumulated
charges becomes very large, negative and
positive charges meet. It produces streaks of
light and sound. This process is called electric
discharge.

When light from an object enters our eyes then only we can see the objects. The light may have
been emitted by the object, or may have been reflected by it.
A polished or a shiny surface acts as a mirror. A mirror can change the direction of light that falls
on it.
After striking the mirror, the ray of light is reflected in another direction. The light ray, that strikes
on any surface, is called incident ray. The ray that comes back from the surface after reflection
is known as the reflected ray.
Normal : The perpendicular to the surface, at the point of incidence is called normal.
Angle of Incidence : The angle between the normal and the incident ray is called the angle of
incidence.
Angle of Reflection : The angle between the normal and the reflected ray is called the angle of
reflection.
The laws of reflection are :
— The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
— The incident ray, the normal and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.

Fig. : Angle of incidence and angle of reflection
Lateral inversion : In an image formed by a mirror, the left side of the object appears on the right
and the right appears on the left. This is known as lateral inversion.
When all the parallel rays reflected from a plane surface are not parallel, the reflection is known
as diffused or irregular reflection.
Reflection from a smooth surface like that of a mirror is called regular reflection.



Multiple Images : Number of images are formed by
mirrors placed at an angle to one another. e.g.,
Kalaeidoscope.



Splitting of light into its colours is known as
dispersion of light. Rainbow is a natural phenomena
showing dispersion.



Human eye : It is roughly spherical in shape.
Cornea : Transparent front part of eye.
Pupil : A small opening in the cornea.
Iris : Coloured part of eyes, it controls the size of pupil.
Lens : Focuses light on retina.
Fig. Human Eye
Retina : Site of image formation.
Cones and Rods : There are two kinds of cells present in Retina.
(i) Cones, that are sensitive to bright light
(ii) Rodes, which are sensitive to dim light.
Blind Spot : At the junction of the optic nerve and the retina there are no sensory cells so no vision
is possible at this spot. This is called the blind spot.
Yellow Spot : It is located in the centre of the retina. It has maximum concentration of light sensitive
cells.



The most comfortable distance at which one can read with a normal eye is about 25 cm. It is also
called least distance of distinct vision.



Some persons can see objects close to them clearly but cannot see distant object. On the other hand
some can see the distant objects clearly but unable to see nearby objects. These are eyesight defects
and can be corrected by using correct power lens.



Care of Eyes : Use suitable spectacles. Too little or too much light is bad. Do not look at the sun
directly, wash your eyes frequently.



Visually challenged persons can read and write using Braille system. It has 63 dot patterns or
characters. Each character represents a letter, a combination of letters, a common word or a
grammatical sign.



Kaleidoscope : It is based on the principle of multiple
reflections. It consists of three plane mirrors (whereas a
periscope, a similar device consists of two plane mirrors).
These three mirrors are inclined at an angle of 60° to
each other in a tube. (hard card board tube). One end of
the tube is closed with the two circular glass discs.
The inner being transparent glass and the outer ground
glass.
— Glass pieces or bangle pieces of various colours are
kept between the two discs.
— Due to relfection, hexagonal patterns of coloured bangles can be seen.
— An interesting features of kaleidoscope is that you will never see the same pattern again.



Persistence of Vision : The impression of an image persists for about 1/16 of a second on the
retina even after we have stopped seeing the object. If still images of a moving object are flashed
on the eye at a rate faster than 1/16 second, then the eye perceives this object as moving.



Owl can see very well in the night. It has a large cornea and a large pupil to allow more light
in its eyes. Its retina has a large number of rods but only a few cones. These features allow the
owl to see at night.

The stars, the planets, the moon and many other objects in the sky are called celestial objects.
Moon does not produce its own light, whereas the Sun and other stars do.
The day on which the whole disc of moon is visible is known as the full-moon day.
On the fifteenth day, when the moon is not visible, the day is known as new-moon day.
The various shapes of the bright part of the moon as seen during a month are called phases of the
moon.
The distance of stars is expressed in light year. One light year is the distance travelled by light in one
year.
The moon’s surface is dusty and barren. There are many craters of different sizes. It also has steep
and high mountains. It has no atmosphere and no water.
The stars forming a group that has a recognisable shape is called a constellation.
E.g.,— Ursa major (Big Dipper, the great bear or the Saptarishi).
— Orion (Hunter), seen during winter in the late evenings).
— Sirius (Brightest star in the sky).
— Cassiopeia (Visible during winter in the early part of the night.
Solar system : The Sun and the celestial bodies that revolve around it form the solar system. It
consists of planets, comets, asteroids and meteors.
The eight planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
A planet has a definite path (in which it revolves around the Sun,) called an orbit.
Some planets are known to have moon/satellites revolving round them.
There are many man-made satellites revolving round the earth. These are called artificial satellites.
Asteroids : There is a large gap in between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. This gap is occupied by a
large number of small objects that revolve around the Sun. These are called asteroids.
Comets : They revolve around the Sun in highly elliptical orbits.
Meteors and Meteorites : Shooting stars are called meteors. A meteor is usually a small object that
occasionalls enters the Earth’s atmosphere. Some meteors are large and so they can reach the earth
before they evaporate completely. The body that reaches the Earth is called a meteorite.
Ursa Major is also called ‘Big Dipper ’. Dipper was a utensil that was used in olden days for drinking
water.
Light year : It is the distance covered by light at its speed in a year. The speed of light is 3 × 108 m/sec.
1 light year = 3 × 108 × 3600 × 24 × 30 × 12 = 9·46 × 1012 kms (Approx.)

Astronomial unit : Distance between the Earth and the Sun is 150,000,000 (15 crore) kms. Light takes
about 8·3 minutes to reach the Earth from the Sun. This distance between Earth and the Sun is also
called 1 Astronomical Unit.
Phases of the moon : When the bright portion of the moon visible from Earth is increasing, these
phases are called waxing phase. When the bright portion is decreasing, this is called vaning phase.
When more than half of the moon is dark, it is called Crescent Moon. When more than half is bright,
it is called Gibbous Moon.

Q. 1. How are phases of moon formed ?
Ans. The day on which the whole disc of the moon
is visible is known as full moon day. Thereafter,
every night the size of the bright part of the
moon becomes thinner and thinner. On the
fifteenth day the moon is not visible, which is
known as new moon day. The next day, only
a small portion of the moon appears in the
sky, known as crescent and then again the
moon grows larger every day. On 15th day
again we get full view of the moon. These
various shapes are called phases. We see
different phases of moon as a result of
difference in sunlight reflected by moon.

Difference in sunlight incident on moons
surface arises due to revolution of moon
around the earth.

We all are aware that our environment is not what it used to be. We ourselves feel the impact of
the degradding quality of air and water in our lives.
Air pollution : When air is contaminated by unwanted substances that have a harmful effect on
both the living and the non-living, it is known as air pollution.
The substances that contaminate the air are called air pollutants. Such as smoke, dust, forest fires
or volcanic eruptions. The other sources are factories, power plants, automobile exhausts and
burning of fire wood and dung cakes.
Smog : A thick fog-like layer in the atmosphere especially during winters, which is made up of
smoke and fog.
Major sources of gaseous orair pollutant are carbon monoxide, sulphurdioxide and nitrogen dioxide.
Other pollutants are ChloroFluoro Carbons (CFCs) that are used in refrigerator, air conditioners
and aerosol sprays.
Greenhouse effect : The trapping of radiations by the Earth’s atmosphere is called the greenhouse
effect. Without this process, life would not have been possible on the Earth. But now it threatens
life. CO2 is one of the gases responsible for this effect.
Due to green house effect, the average temperature is gradually increasing, called global warming.
Gases like methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), CO2 and vapour are called as Green-house gases.
Acid rain : The gases such as sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) reacts with water
vapour in the atmosphere to form sulphuric acid and nitric acid and consitutes the acid rain.
Marble cancer : (i) Acid rain has resulted in corrosion of the marble of the Taj. The phenomenon
is called Marble Cancer.
(ii) Suspended Particulate matter (SPM) emitted from mathura oil refinery, has been responsible
for yellowing of the marble of Taj.
CNG and LPG : (i) The Supreme Court has ordered industries to switch to cleaner and safer fuels
such as CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) and LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gas).
Water Pollution : Whenever harmful substances such as sewage, toxic chemicals, silt etc. get mixed
with water, the water becomes polluted.
Ganga is one of the ten most endangered rivers in the world. An ambitious plan to save the river
Ganga called Ganga Action Plan was launched in 1985.
Water that is suitable for drinking is called potable water. 25% of the world’s population is living
without safe drinking water.

Short Answer Type Questions—I (2 marks)
Q. 1. Describe green house effect in your own
words.
(NCERT)
Ans. Green house effect means warming the
environment. A part of the radiation that falls
on the Earth is absorbed by it and a part is
reflected back into space. A part of the
reflected radiation is trapped by the
atmosphere. This trapping of radiation
increases the temperature and warms up the
atmosphere, called atmosphere effect.
2
Q. 2. Prepare a brief speech on global warming.
(NCERT)
Ans. The average temperature of the Earth’s
atmosphere is gradually increasing and is
called global warming. Excess of CO2 in
atmosphere causes pollution. Whereas CO2
is continuously being released because of
human activities. Deforestation leads to
increase in CO2. This increased CO2 traps
the heat and does not allow it to escape into
space. As a result the average temperature of
the earth’s atmosphere is gradually



increasing, and it is called global warming. 2
Q. 3.
Describe the threat to the beauty of the Taj
Mahal.
(NCERT)
Ans.
The Taj Mahal is located in Agra. It is made
up of white marble. The industries located in
and around Agra like rubber processing,
automobile, chemicals and especially the
Mathura oil Refinery, have been responsible
for producing pollutants like SO2 and NO2.
These gases react with water vapour and
rain, forming acid rain, Acid corrodes the
marble of this monument and this is called
marble cancer.
2
Q. 3.
Why does the increased level of nutrients
in the water effect the survival of aquatic
organisms ?
(NCERT)
Ans.
Excessive quantities of chemical that get
washed from the fields by any means such
as fertilizers act as nutrient for algae to
flourish. Once the algae die, they serve as
food for decomposers like bacteria. A lot of
oxygen in the water body gets used up. This

116 ]

OSWAAL CBSE Question Bank Chapterwise Solutions, Science-VIII
results in decrease in the oxygen level, which
may kill aquatic organisms. This increase in
algal content of water body is called algal
bloom and reduced level of O2 is left the
water body. This process is called
Eutrophication.
2
Q. 5.
What has been done to reduce pollution in
Delhi ?
Ans.
Delhi is one of the most polluted cities in the
world. It was choked by fumes released from
automobiles running on diesel and petrol. A
decision was taken to switch to fuel like CNG
and unleaded petrol. These measures have
resulted in cleaner air for the city.
2
Q. 5.
What is the recent climate change report ?
Ans.
The recent climate change report gives us
only a limited time to keep greenhouse gases
at the present level. Otherwise, the temperature may rise by more than 2°C by the end
of the century, a level considered dangerous.
2
Q. 5.
How can hot water can also be a pollutant ?
Ans.
Hot water can also be a pollutant. This is
usually the water from power plants and
industries. It is released into the rivers. It
raises the temperature of water body,
adversely affecting the animals and plants
living in it.
2
Q. 5.
How untreated sewage is the major cause
of water pollution ?

Ans. Sometimes untreated sewage is thrown
directly into the rivers. It contains food waste,
detergents, microorganisms etc. Thus, water
gets contaminated with bacteria, fungi,
viruses, parasites which can cause diseases
such as cholera, typhoid and jaundice. 2
Q. 9. Write full form of CNG and LPG.
Ans. CNG : Compressed Natural Gas.
LPG : Liquified Petroleum Gas.

that the Ganga is an endangered river. The
town and cities through which it passes
throw large quantities of garbage, untreated
sewage, dead bodies, etc. makes river dead.
A plan launched in 1985 to save this river
is Ganga Action Plan.

Value Based Questions (5 marks)
Q. 1. My sister is in the habit of keeping the tap
open while brushing her teeth. She loves to
bath under shower. My neighbour uses
hosepipe attached to drinking water supply
pipe for washing his scooter and car.
According to me their way of handling the
most precious source water is absolutely
wrong. Do you agree with me or not ? What
changes in the above situation can be done
to conserve water ?

Ans. If your sister and neighbour are wasting the
precious water; I agree with you because we
have very less amount of potable water on
the Earth. As population increases there will
be scarcity of this. To control this situation
we must talk with them regarding
importance of water and tell them alternative
methods for their task, such as use bucket to
take bath and clean their vehicles.
