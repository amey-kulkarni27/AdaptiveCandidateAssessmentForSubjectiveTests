" Derive the equation of motion, S = ut + at Distance  by graphical method.  Which of the two bodies A and B in the following graph is moving with higher speed and why ? x time   y Velocity  velocity "," Similarity : Both the graphs show uniform acceleration. Dissimilarity : In first graph the body starts from rest  while in second graph the initial velocity is non-zero .  Acceleration of a body is defined as the rate of change of its velocity with time. Change in velocity Acceleration = Time taken for change The acceleration is taken to be positive if it is in the direction of velocity. Example : a bus moving with increasing speed. The acceleration is taken to be negative when it is opposite to the direction of light. Example : when the brake is applied, the speed of car decreases. The SI unit is ms–2"
" Using velocity time graph derive : v2 – u2 = 2as.  A ball is gently dropped from a height of 20 m. If its velocity increases uniformly at the rate of 10m/s, with what velocity will it strike the ground ? 		 "," The speed-time  graph for a body under uniform acceleration is given in the fig. as : x time  y u velocity  x time  v speed/velocit y Speed of the body is directly proportional to q, Larger the value of q, the greater is the speed of the body. Thus, B moves with higher speed. 5"
 When will you say a body is in :  Uniform acceleration.  Non-uniform acceleration ?  A train starts from rest and accelerates uniformly for 30 s to acquire a velocity of 108 km/h. It travels with this velocity for 20 min. The driver now applies brakes and the train retards uniformly to stop after 20 s. Find the total distance covered by the train. ,"  A body is in uniform acceleration if it travels in a straight path when its velocity increases or decreases by equal time intervals. 		 A body is in non-uniform acceleration if it travels in a straight path when its velocity increases or decreases by unequal amount in equal time intervals.  When train starts from rest, u = 0, t = 30 s, v = 108 km/h = 30 m/s. a = v–u t Distance S1 = ut + = 1 m/s . at2 = 450 m. At uniform velocity of 30 m/s for 20 min = 1200 s, 		 Distance S2 = 30 × 1200 = 36000 m. On applying brakes, t = 20 s, u = 30 m/s, v = 0 a= v–u Distance S3 = t v –u = – 1.5 m/s2 = 300 m 2a Total distance = S1 + S2 + S3 = 36750 m."
" Write three advantages of velocity-time graph.  A bus starting from rest moves with a uniform acceleration of 0·1 m/s2 for 2 minutes. Find the speed acquired, and the distance travelled. "," Advantages :  It helps to determine the total time.  It helps to determine distance travelled, instantaneous velocity 		 It helps to determine acceleration of the object.   u = 0, a = 0·1 m/s2, t = 2 min = 120 s. speed acquired v = ? distance travelled s = ? From v = u + at v = 0 + 0·1 × 120 = 12 m/s From s = ut + at2 = 720 m "
" Draw velocity-time graph for a body starting its motion with a velocity “u” and under uniform acceleration “a” it acquires a velocity “v” in time “t”.  Using above graph, derive II equation of motion for position-time relation.  Explain how is it possible for an object to move with a constant speed but with uniform acceleration. "," The speed time  graph for a body under uniform acceleration is given in the fig. as : v Speed/velocit y or, s = u t Time  Derivation of second equation of motion : Equation for position-time relation – Distance travelled, s = area of the trapezium OABC or, s =  		 + area of the rectangle OADC or, s= +  s =  +  From the figure, AD = OC = t BD =  =  =  = at OA = u Putting these above values in equation , we get s =  +  s = ut + at velocity  velocity  This is the second equation of motion.  Motion in circular path with constant speed since direction of velocity changes at every point, acceleration is uniform"
 Identify the following graphs and answer the questions : Time   Time   velocity  Time    Which of the graphs indicate negative acceleration ? Why ?  What do you infer from the graph where velocity time graph is parallel to the time axis ? 		 Which of the graphs represent a body moving with initial velocity not equal to zero but with constant acceleration ? Justify your answer.  A bus starting from rest moves with a uniform acceleration 0·1m/s2 for 2 minutes. Find :  the speed acquired  the distance travelled. ,"  Graph I; since velocity decreases with time. 		 Since velocity is constant the acceleration of the body is zero. 		 Graph III ; since the velocity-time graph does not pass through the origin.  As v = u + at, v = 0 + 0·1 × 120 = 12 m/s. As s = ut + at2, 0 + = 720 m "
