Ravi’s mother was preparing sweets at home. She put some raisins in the water. Ravi saw the raisins and asked his mother that why the raisins had swelled up in water. His mother replied him scientifically and told that this is due to endosmosis.  What is Endosmosis ?  Why is plasma membrane called selectively permeable membrane ?  What values were shown by Ravi ?," Osmosis is the movement of water from the region of its higher concentration  to the region of its lower concentration, when the two are separated by a semipermeable membrane. When external water enters the cell it is known as Endosmosis.  Cell membrane is semi permeable membrane for water, ions, sugar, amino acids etc. These substances pass through the plasma membrane by an active process so it is called selectively permeable.  Ravi showed curiosity and skillfulness towards knowledge."
Sheela was washing clothes for a long time. She saw her hands and she found that the skin of her fingers was shrunk. She was amazed to see her hands and was worried.  Why does the skin of Sheela’s fingers shrink when she washes clothes for a long time ?  What makes Sheela worried ?," Clothes are washed with soap or detergent solution. This solution is hypertonic as compared to osmotic concentration of our skin cells. The washing solution, therefore, causes exosmosis in the skin cells that come in contact with if for sometime. Because of it, the skin over the fingers shrinks while washing clothes for a longtime.  Sheela was worried because her fingers had shrunk. But she didn’t know that after sometime her fingers will come back to their original shape."
Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from solution with lower solute concentration  to the solution with higher solute concentration  through a selectively permeable membrane. The movement takes place due to the osmotic gradient created by difference in concentration of the solutions on both sides of the membrane and the end result is a state where osmotic equilibrium is reached wherein movement of the fluid ceases.  What is the importance of osmosis in daily life ? Give four examples.  Is it useful for plants or not ?,"  When your hands are immersed in dishwater for a long time, your skin looks bloated. This is an effect of osmosis. 		 When you pour salt onto a slug, water diffuses and slug shrinks as a result of osmosis. 		 When you cook food and put sauce in the liquid part of your dish, some part of the solute moves inside the solid part of the food you are cooking. The solid part could be an egg, piece of meat but the sauce is made of solute and not water, so it will move into the food. 		 Osmosis also plays an important part in the body. It helps in the transfer of water and various nutrients between blood and fluid of cells. 		 Reverse osmosis is a type of osmosis which is used to convert sewage water into clean drinking water.   Yes, it is useful for plants."
