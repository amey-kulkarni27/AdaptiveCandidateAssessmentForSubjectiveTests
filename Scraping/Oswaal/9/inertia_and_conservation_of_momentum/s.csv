State why Newton’s first law of motion is called law of inertia. ,"Inertia is a tendency of the object to resist change in its state. Newton’s first law of motion also states similar i.e., the object will remain in its present state unless an external force is applied. That’s why Newton’s first law is called Law of inertia."
Which is having higher value of momentum ? A bullet of mass 10 g moving with a velocity of 400 m/s or a cricket ball of mass 400 g thrown with the speed of 90 km/hr. ,Momentum  = mass  × velocity . Mass of bullet = 10 g = 10 × 10–3 kg 			 = 10–2 kg Velocity of bullet = 400 m/s 2 Marks each 		Momentum of bullet = 10–2 kg × 400 m/s = 4 kg m/s 		 Mass of cricket ball = 400 g = 400 × 10–3 kg 			 = 0·400 kg Velocity of ball = 90 km/hr 90 × 1000 m 3600 m = 25 m/s 		 Momentum of ball = 0·400 × 25 = 10 kg m/s \ The cricket ball has higher momentum.
Why does the pillion rider fall forward when brakes are applied ? ,"During the ride, pillion rider and driver are in a state of motion. But when the driver applies brakes, the body of pillion rider continues moving forward on account of inertia of motion. Therefore, the pillion rider falls forward."
 A ball is allowed to roll down from an inclined plane. It reaches the foot of the plane and continues to roll on the ground. It stops after travelling some distance. Is this the violation of law of inertia? Give reasons for your answer.   A player lowers his hand while catching a ball. Explain reason behind his action. ,"Refer 9.6 page 123 NCERT book  3 Detailed Answer : Activity :  Take a test tube of good quality glass material and put a small amount of water in it. Place a stop cork at the mouth of it.  Now suspend the test tube horizontally by two strings or wires as shown in fig.  Heat the test tube with a burner until water vaporises and the cord blows out.  Observe that the test tube recoils in the direction opposite to the direction of the cork.  Also, observe the difference in the velocity the cork appears to have and that of the recoiling test tube. Hence, the total momentum of the two objects is unchanged or conserved by the collision."
"Which accident will be more damaging, collision between two trucks moving with a speed of 50km/ hr. or collision between two cars moving with a speed of 50 km/hr. ? Explain. ","Colision between trucks, because more is the mass, more is the inertia and therefore more is the momentum. Mass of the trucks is more than that of cars so collision of trucks will cause more damage. 3"
A body of mass 4 kg is dropped from a height of 20 m. Calculate the initial momentum and the momentum just before it strikes the ground  ," No. It is not the violation of law of inertia. Law of inertia is obeyed only when no external force acts on a body. But in this case the friction due to the ground acts on the ball, so it comes to rest.  Player lowers his hand because by doing so he increases the time in which velocity of ball comes to zero. This decreases the rate of change of momentum and so the impact of force is reduced. "
 Which one has more inertia : a five rupee coin or a one rupee coin ? Why ?  Two objects P and Q of masses ‘m’ and ‘4m’ move with velocities ‘v’ and ‘4v’ respectively. Calculate the ratio of their linear momenta. ," Five rupee coin, because it has more mass.  P1 = mv P2 = 4m × 4v = 16mv P1/P2 = 1 : 16 "
" State the name of the object which has more inertia : 		 a rubber ball and a stone of the same size. 		 an empty box and another similar box filled with clothes.  Give reasons for the following : 		 Luggage placed on the roof of a car or bus is tied with rope. 		 When a branch of a tree is shaken vigorously, some of the leaves drop down. ","  Stone.  Box filled with clothes.   This is done to prevent luggage from falling when the vehicle is suddenly stopped or started because due to inertia the luggage will experience a jerk in a direction opposite to the direction of vehicle.  On shaking, branch comes to state of motion and leaves which are in state of rest experience a jerk due to which these get detached and fall down. "
Define inertia. Write an activity to show that inertia of a body depends on its mass. ,Inertia : Inability of the body to change by itself its state of rest or state of uniform motion. Activity :  Apply some force on a football.  It flies away as it has small inertia.  Apply same force on same size of stone.  Stone hardly moves as it has more inertia.  1 + 2
State the law of Inertia. Why do we fall in forward direction if a moving bus stops suddenly and fall in the backward direction if it suddenly accelerates from rest ? ,"Law of Inertia : An object remains in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line until an external unbalanced force acts on it. When a moving bus stops suddenly, the bus slows down but our body tends to remain in state of motion due to inertia of motion. Sudden start of bus brings motion to the bus as well as our feet but rest of the body still has inertia of rest due to which we fall backwards. "
When a fast moving horse stops suddenly a careless rider falls in the forward direction. Give reason for it. ,"It is because of inertia of motion. When the horse was in motion, the whole body of the rider was in motion. But when the horse stops suddenly the lower portion of the rider which is in contact with the horse comes to rest but the upper portion of him wants to remain in motion. "
 Why are the wheels of vehicle provided with mud guards ?  A cricket player lowers his hand while catching a ball. Why ?  Why does a glass pane of a window gets shattered when a flying pebble hits it ? ," Due to inertia of direction, wheels rotate at high speed and mud sticking to the wheel flies off tangentially.  This increases the time of catching, decreases the acceleration of the ball, hence force exerted on the hands decreases.  High velocity of pebbles, decreases to zero in a very short interval of time for which it remains in contact with glass pane and shatters the glass pane. "
State and prove law of conservation of momentum.,"Momentum possessed by a body is defined as the product of mass and velocity of the body. If a body of mass  moves with a velocity , then momentum p is given by, p = mv Law of conservation of Momentum : When no external force acts on a body, its momentum will remain constant. We know, that F = F1 + F2 + ....................... + FN Total change in momentum Force = Time taken Sum of momentum change in each mass Time When F = 0, then p = constant or p1 + p2 ............... PN = constant i.e., sum of the momentum = constant"
