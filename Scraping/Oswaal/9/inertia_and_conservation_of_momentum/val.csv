"Akhtar, Kiran and Rahul were riding in a motorcar that was moving with a high velocity on an expressway when an insect hit the windshield and got stuck on the windscreen. Akhtar and Kiran started pondering over the situation.  Kiran suggested that the insect suffered a greater change in momentum as compared to the change in momentum of the motorcar .  Akhtar said that since the motorcar was moving with a larger velocity, it exerted a larger force on the insect. And as a result the insect died.  Rahul while putting an entirely new explanation said that both the motorcar and the insect experienced the same force and a change in their momentum. Comment on these suggestions.","Since both car and insect are moving with uniform speed, and there is no external force applied. Hence, total momentum is conserved, i.e. 		 +  =  v =  × v  37500 – 0.05 = 1500·01 × v 37499·95 = 1500·01 × v v = 377499.95 = 24·9998 m/s So velocity of insect changes from – 5 m/s to 24·9998 m/s  		Velocity of car changes from 25 m/s to 24·9998 m/s 		  Change in momentum of the car =  –  = mc = – 0·3 N-s Change in momentum of the insect =  –  = mi = 0·01 ×  = 0·3 N-s ⇒ The momentum gained by the insect is equal to the momentum lost by the car.  Kiran is incorrect in terms of change in momentum. However she is correct, the change in velocity of insect is higher than that of the car.  Akhtar observation is correct that speed of car is higher than that of insect. However he is incorrect that the insect experiences larger force. According to Newton’s third law of motion both experienced same amount of force.  Rahul is correct that both experienced same force. If he says the amount of change in momentum in both objects is same, then he is correct. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/force www.physicsclassroom.com teachertech.rice.edu csep10.phys.utk.edu en.wikipedia.org/wiki/newtion’s_law_of_motion. www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects vss/does/propulsion/2-what-is-incrtia qqq"
