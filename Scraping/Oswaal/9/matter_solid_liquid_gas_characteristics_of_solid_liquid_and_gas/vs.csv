0,Q. 1. Why do liquids have mostly lower density than soilds ? ,Ans. Liquids have less force of attraction between molecules i.e. less mass and more volume as compared to solids.  
1,"Q. 2. Arrange the following substances in the increasing order of force of attraction between their particles : Oxygen, salt, milk. ",Ans. Oxygen < milk < salt. 
2,Q. 3. What happens when you open a bottle of perfume ? ,Ans. Particles of perfume diffuses into the air and can be smelled even at a distance.
3,"Q. 4. Sponge is a solid, yet we are able to compress it. Why ? ","Ans. A sponge has minute holes, in which air is trapped. When we press it, air is expelled out and we are able to compress it. "
4,"Q. 5. When 2 ml of dettol is dissolved in 100 ml of water, the smell can be detected even on repeated dilution. Identify the physical nature of matter. ",Ans. Particles of matter are very small which can be dissolved in water diffusing its smell readily in air.  1
5,Q. 6. Name the state of matter in which particles just move around randomly because of very weak force of attraction. ,Ans. Gaseous state.  1
6,"Q. 7. Identify the name of the material which has no fixed shape but a fixed volume : Wood, a piece of iron, oxygen and water. ",Ans. Water.  1
7,"Q. 8. If the food is being cooked in the kitchen, name the process which brings smell. ","Ans. Due to high speed of particles and large space between them, gases show the property of diffusing very fast."
8,Q. 9. Give two examples of practical applications which is based on high compressibility of gases. ,"Ans. CNG, LPG. "
9,"Q. 10. Select the substances from the following which do not have the property of sublimation : Camphor, Potassium permanganate, Copper sulphate, Naphthalene. ","Ans. Potassium permanganate, Copper sulphate ½ + ½ "
10,"Q. 11. When a drop of blue ink is put in water, the blue colour spreads and the whole solution becomes blue. Name the phenomenon due to which this happens. ",Ans. Diffusion.  1
11,Q. 12. A diver is able to cut through water in a swimming pool. Which property of matter does this observation show ? ,Ans. Particles of water are held together by weak forces of attraction. It is these forces of attraction which the diver cuts through water in the swimming pool. 
12,Q. 13. A gas jar ‘X’ containing air is inverted over another jar ‘Y’ containing a brown gas which is heavier than air. After some time brown colour is also observed in the gas jar ‘X’. Identify the phenomenon associated with this observation ,Ans. Diffusion.  1
13,Q. 14. A crystal of Copper sulphate is dropped in a glass of water and is allowed to settle at the bottom. After some time it is observed that the blue colour appears just above the solid crystal and with the passage of time whole water in glass turns blue. Identify the characteristic of particles of matter associated with this observation. ,Ans. Particles of matter are continuously moving. 
14,Q. 15. A substance has no mass; can we consider it as matter ? ,Ans. No. 
15,Q. 16. Mention two factors that need to be varied to liquify atmospheric gases. ,Ans. Temperature and pressure. 
16,Q. 17. Name the property of gases that helps aquatic plants and animals to survive in water ? ,Ans. Solubility in water. 
17,Q. 18. A substance has a finite volume but not a definite shape. Write the physical state of substance. ,Ans. Liquid.  1
18,Q. 19. Name the property of gases due to which it is possible to fill CNG in cylinders for using as fuel in cars. ,Ans. Compressibility.
