" A diver is able to cut through water in a swimming pool. Which property of matter does this observation suggest ? How ?  Liquids generally have lower density as compared to solids, but ice floats on water. Find out why ? "," The particles of water are held together by weak forces of attraction. It is these forces of attraction which the diver cuts through water in the swimming pool.  In ice, the mass per unit volume  =D  i.e. V density of ice is lesser than the density of water, hence ice floats on water."
What is the effect of change of pressure on physical state of matter ? Explain with an example of a gas. ,The physical state of matter can be changed by changing the pressure. By lowering temperature and increasing the pressure gases can be changed into liquids and some solids can be changed into gases on decreasing the pressure. This happens with gases as there is lots of space between the particles of a gas and upon applying high pressure particles come close to each other which upon cooling gets liquified.
 After winters people pack off their woollens by keeping Naphthalene balls in them. With passage of time these balls become smaller in size. Why does this happen ? What type of change is involved during this process ?  How can you convert a saturated solution into an unsaturated solution ? ," Sublimation, Naphthalene balls sublimate and becomes smaller in size.

Give reasons for the following :  Solids are incompressible  Solids have negligible kinetic energy. ," Solids are incompressible because the particles are closely packed and there is no space for their movement.  The particles of solids do not have any intermolecular space and hence no movement. Therefore, they have negligible kinetic energy."
Give reasons :  Why gases exert pressure on the walls of container.  Gases undergo diffusion very fast. ," The particles of a gas are free to move randomly in all directions. During the motion they collide with each other and also with the walls of container.  Particles of a gas are loosely packed, move randomly due to space between them, so they intermix with other particles present there.  1½ + 1½"
Give reasons :  Naphthalene balls disappear with time without leaving any solid.   A gas fills a vessel completely. ," Naphthalene being volatile converts from solid to gas directly by the process called sublimation. Therefore, no solid residue is left after sometime as it takes the heat from surroundings and sublimes.  Particles of gas have negligible force of attraction between them and possess high kinetic energy. Therefore, they move very fast to fill the vessel completely in which they are kept."
Explain the inter conversion of three states of matter in terms of force of attraction and kinetic energy of the molecules. ,"During the inter conversion of a solid into a liquid, and liquid into gas, on increasing the temperature the kinetic energy of the molecules increases and force of attraction among molecules decreases and vice versa.  3"
