0,Q. 1.  Explain the term diffusion. Illustrate with an activity that rate of diffusion increases with temperature.  Name two compressed gases which are used in :  Our homes for cooking. 		 Are supplied to hospital in cylinders. ,"Ans.  When particles to one substance occupy the vacant space present in the particles of the other substance, this is called diffusion. Activity : 		1. Take 5 g of copper sulphate each in three beakers. 		2. Pour 100 ml of distilled water slowly in one of the beakers. 		3. Cover this beaker with a watch glass. 		4. Pour 100 ml of cold water in a second beaker slowly. 		5. Place a third beaker containing 100 ml of water on a tripod stand for heating. 		6. Observe the diffusion process which begins in all the beakers. 		7. Record the time taken for the dissolution of copper sulphate in all the three cases. Conclusion : The rate of diffusion of copper sulphate in water is in the order : Beaker 3 > Beaker 2 > Beaker 1.   Liquified Petroleum Gas  		 Oxygen."
1,Q. 2.  Define melting point. Describe an activity with labelled diagram to find melting point of ice.  Explain why temperature remains same during melting of ice. ,"Ans.  Melting point of a solid is defined as the temperature at which a solid melts to become a liquid at the atmospheric pressure. Activity : l Take about 150 g of ice in a beaker and suspend a laboratory thermometer so that its bulb is in contact with the ice. l Start heating the beaker on a low flame. l Note the temperature when the ice starts melting. 5 Marks each Note the temperature when all the ice has converted into water. l Record your observations for this conversion of solid to liquid state. l Now, put a glass rod in the beaker and heat while stirring till the water starts boiling. l Keep a careful eye on the thermometer reading till most of the water had vaporised. l Record observations.  The temperature remains constant during the melting of ice even though heat is supplied regularly as the temperature is supplied for changing the state of matter. The heat of temperature is consumed by the particles of ice and they vibrate faster and breaks the force of attraction and becomes liquid.

2,Q. 6.  Mention the physical state of water at :  Out of boiling and evaporation which is a surface phenomenon ? Explain. In the absence of a refrigerator butter is kept wrapped in a wet cloth during summer. Why ?  Why do ice-cream appears colder than water at the same temperature ?,"Ans.  Evaporation is a surface phenomenon. Particles from the surface gain enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction present in the liquid and change into vapour state. 		 Due to wet cloth the temperature is comparatively lower than room temperature so butter does not melt when remain wrapped in wet cloths.  Ice cream at 273 K, it will take latent heat from the medium to convert itself into liquid at 273 K and then into liquid at higher temperature but in water such condition is not possible.  5"
3,"Q. 4.  Define evaporation. Out of nylon and cotton clothes, which will be more comfortable during summer and why ?  100°C  0°C.  Convert the following temperature into Celsius scale :  298 K  300 K  280 K ","Ans.  The process of conversion of liquid state into vapour state at any temperature below the boiling point of the liquid is called evaporation. Cotton is a better absorber of water than Nylon. So, during summer, cotton clothes absorb sweat, which on evaporation causes a cooling sensation in the body.  Not exactly same. Boiling of liquid takes place at its Boiling point, whereas evaporation can occurs at any temperature or room temperature.  1 + 2 + 2  280 – 273 = 7°C"
4,"Q. 5. Explain with the examples from your daily life where cooling is caused by evaporation.  When sugar crystals dissolve in water, the level of water does not rise appreciably.  Doctors advise to put strips of wet cloth on the forehead of a person having high fever. ","Ans.  Particles of sugar crystals occupy the space between the particles of water.  The excess heat from the body is taken by high latent heat of vaporization of water. As a result, temperature of body decreases.  Sublimation, naphthalene gets converted into vapours.  Because a wooden table has a fixed shape as well as fixed volume and it is uncompressible also.  Evaporation of saliva causes cooling. "
5,"Q. 9. The temperature - time graph given below shows the heating curve for pure wax. After studying the graph answer the following questions :  1100C D1 D2 Temperature 150C A1 B1 Time  What is the physical state of the substance at the point A, B, C and D ?  What is the melting point of the substance ?  What is its boiling point ?  Which portions of the graph indicate that change of state is taking place ?  Name the terms used for heat absorbed during change of states involved in the above process.",Ans.  A – solid C – liquid B – fusion D – vaporization  15°C  110°C  A1B1 and D1D2  Latent heat of fusion and latent heat of vaporization. 
6,"Q. 10. 5 ml of water was taken in a test-tube and China dish separately. These samples were then kept under different conditions as below : Time  Temp.  Based on the above observations, answer the following questions :  State the change observed between 2 min. to 3 min., and name the process involved.  Between 30 min. to 35 min., the temperature remains constant. State the reason for this. Name the heat involved in the process and define it. ","Ans.  Ice converts to water. Process : Fusion.  Heat is used for conversion of state. Reason : Because of latent heat of vaporization. The latent heat of vaporization is the amount of heat required to convert a unit mass of liquid into its vapour state, without a change in its temperature at its boiling point.   Both the samples are kept under a fan."
7,"Q. 12. Give reasons for the following :  Both the samples are kept inside a cupboard. State in which case evaporation will be faster ? Give reasons to support your answer. How will the rate of evaporation change if above activity is carried out on a rainy day ? Justify your answer.   Why do we see droplets of water on the outer surface of a glass containing ice cold water ?  After a hot sunny day, people sprinkle water on the roof or open ground.","Ans.   Water vapour of air condenses because it loses energy when it comes in contact with cool surface. 		 Evaporation leads to decrease in temperature because water takes heat for evaporation from floor.  Take about 150 g of ice in a beaker and suspend a laboratory thermometer so that its bulb is in contact with the ice. l Start heating the beaker on a low flame. l Note the temperature when the ice starts melting. l Note the temperature when all the ice has converted into water. l Record your observations for this conversion of solid to liquid state. l Now, put a glass rod in the beaker and heat while stirring till the water starts boiling. l Keep a careful eye on the thermometer reading till most of the water has vaporised. Observation : As the ice reaches its melting point, it starts converting into water. Thermometer Glass stirrer"
8,"Q. 13. Rahul observes the changes in temperature at different intervals as follows :  For the first time interval from ‘t1’. to ‘t2’ seconds, the temperature first gradually dropped from 30°C to 0°C.  For the next time interval from ‘t2’ to ‘t3’ seconds, the temperature remained constant until all the ice melted.  In the next time interval from ‘t3’ to ‘t4’ seconds, the temperature then increased gradually from 0°C to 100°C.  Draw the graph to show the above mentioned changes. 		Now answer the following :  Name the property by virtue of which the temperature remained constant in observation .  What should be subsequent reading of temperature on further heating after ‘t4’ seconds of Rahul’s observation ? Beaker Ice Stand  Burner",Ans.
