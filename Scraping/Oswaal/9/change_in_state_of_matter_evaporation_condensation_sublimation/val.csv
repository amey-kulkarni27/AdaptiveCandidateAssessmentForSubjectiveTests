"One day, when Suhani was playing with mother’s cosmetics, she felt cold, when a liquid bottle broke and some liquid fell on her hand, she got worried. She washed her hand and immediately asked her mother why she felt cold. Her mother answered her.  Can you guess what was that liquid ?  Why Suhani felt cool when liquid fell on her hand ?  What values are shown by Suhani’s mother ?"," The liquid is nail paint remover which contains an ether or acetone.  Ether evaporates by taking heat energy from the hand . That’s why she felt cold.  She exhibits knowledge, carefulness and educating nature towards her daughter."
"Sakhi went to her grandmother’s village, where she found most of the ladies preparing dal in a sauce pan. She advised them to use pressure cooker instead of sauce pan to cook food faster.  How pressure cooker is helpful in cooking food faster ?  What values are displayed by Sakhi ?  How the use of pressure cooker is useful ?"," The pressure in the enclosed volume above the liquid reaches much greater values than atmospheric pressure, thus the temperature of boiling water within the cooker is greater than the normal boiling temperature. Hence, food cooks much faster.  She is trying to do social work by educating village women about the usefulness of pressure cooker as faster means of cooking food."
Q. 3.,Ans.
Q. 4.," Pressure cooker helps in cooking food at faster rate, thus saves energy and time. Rahul is fond of mountaineering. In his summer holidays, he planned to climb a high mountain with his friends. During climbing one of his friends got hurt and required hot water for the treatment. He quickly took out his burner to boil the water. He found that on the mountain water took much less time to boil than on the ground.  Why does water boil at a lower temperature at higher altitudes ?  What values are displayed by Rahul ?  Give one more example related to this phenomenon.  Boiling occurs at a point where vapour pressure is equal to the external atmospheric pressure. At higher altitudes atmospheric pressure is much less. Less thermal energy is required to get vapour pressure equal to the atmospheric pressure.  This shows that Rahul is sympathetic and friendly.  Cooking of potatoes take much longer at the top of a mountain because boiling temperature of water is lower. One day Ravi fell ill and was suffering from high fever. Doctor advised his mother to put wet strips of cloth on his forehead. His mother took the doctor’s advice properly and put wet strips of cloth on Ravi’s forehead. The process was very helpful in bringing down his fever.  Why wet strips of cloth are put on the forehead of the person suffering from high fever ?  What values are displayed by mother ?  Name the phenomenon involved in this process.  Water in the wet strips of the cloth takes heat from the body of the person while evaporating. This brings down the body temperature of the person.  This shows that Ravi’s mother is caring and intelligent.  Evaporation."
" Archit dropped a crystal of potassium permanganate into two beakers A and B containing hot water and cold water respectively. After keeping the beakers undisturbed for some time what did he observe and why ?  State two characteristic properties each of :  solid,  liquid and  gas.  What values are shown by Archit ?", Potassium permanganate crystals diffuse faster in hot water because as the temperature increases diffusion increases.  Properties of solid : They have a fixed shape and volume. They are rigid. Properties of liquid : They have fixed volume but not fixed shape. They are not rigid. Properties of gas : They neither have fixed shape nor fixed volume. They are highly compressible.  Archit showed his experimental and observatory skills.
" You want to wear your favourite shirt in a party, but the problem is that it is still wet after a wash. Mention three steps with reason that you would take to dry it faster ?  It is a hot summer day; Priyanshi and Ali are wearing cotton and nylon clothes respectively.  Who do you think would be more comfortable and why ?  During rainy season we feel sticky and uncomfortable even under the fan why ?"," To dry it faster, rate of evaporation has to be increased, for this :  We can spread it to increase surface area.  We can iron it to increase temperature.  We can spread it under fan to increase wind speed.   Priyanshi will be more comfortable as in cotton clothes sweat will evaporate faster by taking latent heat of vapourization from the body and thus making it comfortable by taking away body’s heat faster.  During rainy season humidity is high so rate of evaporation is slower. 1 × 3 + 1 + 1"
