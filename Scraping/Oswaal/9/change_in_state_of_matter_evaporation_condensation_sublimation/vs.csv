0,Q. 1. What is meant by latent heat of fusion ? ,Ans. The amount of heat energy that is required to change 1 kg of a solid into liquid at atmospheric pressure at its melting point is known as the latent heat of fusion. 
1,Q. 2. The molecules of water have more energy as compared to molecules of ice at same temperature. Justify this statement. ,Ans. Water has more energy than ice at same temperature because particles in water have absorbed more energy during the change of state.  1
2,Q. 3. State one difference between gas and vapour.  1 Mark each,"Ans. Gas : It is a stable state as compared to vapour. e.g. O2 , H 2 . Vapour : It is an unstable state. On normal cooling vapour changes into liquid state. "
3,Q. 4. The boiling point and freezing point of water are 100°C and 0°C respectively. Convert these temperatures in K. ,Ans. 100°C + 273 = 373 K 0°C + 273 = 273 K 
4,Q. 5. Why does palm of your hand feel cold when you pour some acetone on your palm ? ,Ans. It will evaporate taking latent heat of vaporization from the palm. The hand looses heat and gets cooled leaving temperature on hand low. 
5,Q. 6. The boiling point of alcohol is 78°C. What is the corresponding temperature on the Kelvin scale ? ,Ans. 78 + 273 = 351 K  1
6,Q. 7. Name the phenomenon of changing of a liquid into vapours at a temperature even below its boiling point. ,Ans. Evaporation. 
7,"Q. 8. Kinetic energy of particles of water in three vessels A, B, C are EA, EB, and EC respectively and EA > EB > EC. Arrange the temperatures TA, TB and TC of water in the three vessels in increasing order. ",Ans. TC < TB < TA
8,Q. 9. A rubber band can change its shape on stretching. Will you classify it as solid or not ? Justify your answer.  ,"Ans. Rubber band changes shape under force and regains the shape when the force is removed, so it is classified as a solid."
9,Q. 10. What happens to the boiling point of a liquid when atmospheric pressure decreases ? ,Ans. Boiling point decreases because boiling point is the temperature at which vapour pressure of a liquid becomes equal to atmospheric pressure.
10,Q. 11. What happens to the melting point of ice when pressure is increased ? ,"Ans. When pressure is applied on the surface of ice, the change into liquid state is assisted. Thus, melting point decreases."
