Epidermal cells of the roots generally have hair like parts. ",Ans.  Cells of bark are dead and compactly arranged without intercellular spaces. They have a chemical called suberin in their walls that make them impervious to gases and water.  The thick waxy coating on epidermis is of cutin on its outer surface which is a chemical substance with water-proof quality. This helps in protection against loss of water and parasitic fungi.  Function of epidermal cells in roots is water absorption. Hair like parts greatly increase the total absorptive surface area.
