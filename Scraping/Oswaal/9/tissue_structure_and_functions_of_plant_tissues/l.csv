0,Q. 1.  Analyse the reason behind the following statements :  Epidermis is thicker in desert plants though it is usually single layered. 		 Presence of waxy layer (secreted by epidermis) on the outer surface of plants.  Discuss the cell arrangement which supports the fact that epidermis is a protective tissue. ,"Ans.   In such habitat, protection against water loss is essential. 		 Protecting against water loss, mechanical injury.  Cells are elongated, flattened, closely packed. No intercellular spaces and form a continuous layer.  5 5 Marks each"
1,Q. 2. The growth of plant occurs only in specific regions:  Name the tissue which is responsible for this growth.  State the different types of this tissue.  Write one function of each of the above mentioned tissue. ,"Ans.  Meristematic tissue.  Apical meristem, lateral meristem, intercalary meristem.  Apical meristem increases the height of the plant. Intercalary meristem increases the length of organs. Lateral meristem increases the girth of stem.  1 + 1 + 3"
2,Q. 3.  “Epidermal cells are protective in nature”. Justify and support your answer with two examples.  Name the structure that receives impulse in neuron.,"Ans.  Epidermis plays a protective role. It protects all the external parts of a plant against loss of water.  In some desert plants, the epidermis has a thick waxy coating of cutin that prevents water loss from the plants.  Epidermal cells on the aerial parts of the plant secrete a waxy, water resistant layer, on the outer surface that helps in protection against loss of water and mechanical injury.  Dendrite receives impulses in neuron."
