What is the difference between uniform velocity and non-uniform velocity ?,"Uniform Velocity : An object with uniform velocity covers equal distances in equal intervals of time in a specified direction e.g., an object moving with speed of 40 km h–1 towards west has uniform velocity. Non-uniform Velocity : When an object covers unequal distances in equal intervals of time in a specified direction, or if the direction of motion changes, it is said to be moving with a non-uniform or variable velocity. e.g., revolving fan at a constant speed has variable velocity."
What do you understand by instantaneous velocity? ,"Instantaneous velocity is the velocity of a body at any particular instance during its motion. For example, the instantaneous velocity of a motorcycle at a particular instance is 40 kmh–1 if it is moving at 40 km h–1 at that particular instance. It is measured by the speedometers on the vehicles. 2"
What is non-uniform or variable acceleration ? ,"If the velocity of an object changes by unequal amounts in equal intervals of time, the object is said to be in non-uniform or variable acceleration e.g., if the speed of a bus travelling along a straight road increases by unequal amounts, then the bus is moving with non-uniform acceleration."
What is negative acceleration ? ,"If the velocity of a body decreases with time, then its final velocity is less than the initial velocity and thus its acceleration is negative. Negative acceleration is called retardation or de-acceleration. For example, when brakes are applied to a moving truck, its velocity gradually decreases. In other words, it is under retardation."
