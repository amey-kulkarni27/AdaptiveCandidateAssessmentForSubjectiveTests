Why is it said that ‘‘a cell without nucleus is without any future’’? ,Nucleus is called the control centre of the cell as it controls all the metabolic activities going in the cell directly or indirectly and also in formation of various cell organelles by controlling the synthesis of proteins.

 Why is the cell called the structural and functional unit of life ?  Why is the plasma membrane called a selectively permeable membrane ?  Name the factor which decides the movement of water across the plasma membrane. , Because shape and size of cells are related to specific functions they perform. Cells constitute various components of plants and animals.  Because it permits exit and entry of some selected materials in and out of the cells.
