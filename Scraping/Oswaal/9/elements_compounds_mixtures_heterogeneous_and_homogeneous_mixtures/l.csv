 Can a homogeneous mixture have a variable composition ? Justify giving an example.  What happens when :  Dilute sulphuric acid is added to a mixture of iron filings and sulphur powder.  Dilute sulphuric acid is added to a mixture of iron filings and sulphur powder heated to red hot followed by cooling. , Homogenous mixtures are the mixtures with uniform composition throughout like sugar solution or another.   Fe + H2SO4 → FeSO4 + H2 		  FeS + H2SO4 → FeSO4 + H2  1 + 1 Detailed Answer :  No. Homogenous mixtures are the mixtures with uniform composition throughout like sugar solution or another.   Results in the formation of ferrous sulphate and evolution of hydrogen. Fe + H2SO4 → FeSO4 + H2 		  Results in the formation of iron sulphide which reacts with sulphure acid to form ferrous sulphate and release of hydrogen disulphide gas. Fe + S → FeS FeS + H2SO4 → FeSO4 + H2
" State two ways by which you can change a saturated solution to unsaturated solution.  Distinguish between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixture by giving one example of each. , ","  By increasing the temperature/by heating the solution.  By increasing the amount of solvent  S. No. Homogeneous Mixture Heterogeneous Mixture  Uniform composition. Non-uniform composition.  No distinct boundaries Distinct boundaries of of separation. separation. e.g., sugar + water. e.g., sand + water."
" List any three characteristics of colloid.   Name the two components of a colloid.  Identify colloid from the following mixtures : Muddy water, Sugar in water, Ink, Blood, Soda water, Foam. 		 , ","  It is heterogeneous mixture. 5 Marks each  Particles of colloids scatter a beam of light.  		 It is stable.  Dispersing medium and dispersed phase.  Ink, Blood, Foam."
" Give two reasons to support the statement that CO2 is a compound and not a mixture.  Classify the following as pure substance or a mixture. If mixture, indicate whether homogeneous or heterogeneous. 		 24 carat gold 		 Air 		 Concrete. ",  Carbon and oxygen are present in a fixed ratio of 3 : 8 by mass in carbon dioxide. 		 The constituents of carbon dioxide cannot be separated by simple physical methods.   24 carat gold is a pure substance. 		 Air is a homogeneous mixture in which the constituents are uniformly distributed through out without any clear boundary of separation. 		 Concrete is a heterogeneous mixture that does not have uniform constituents. 2 + 3
 A solution contains 60 g of common salt in 240 g of water. Calculate the concentration in terms of mass by mass percentage of solution.  Give the principle of the following technique used in separation of mixture : 		 Centrifugation 		 Chromatography 		 Distillation. ," Concentration of solution Mass of solute Mass 			 of solution Mass of common salt is 60 g. Mass of water is 240 g. Mass of solution = 60 + 240 = 300 g. Concentration of solution =   Centrifugation : Two components having difference in densities can be separated by centrifugation. When the mixture is rotated fast, the lighter particles come to the top and the heavier remain at the bottom. 		 Chromatography : This method is used to separate a mixture of different dyes. It is based on the difference in solubilities of different solutes in the same solvent. 		 Distillation : Two miscible liquids can be separated by simple distillation. It is based on the difference in boiling points of the liquid components of the mixture."
"Based on the following characteristics distinguish in tabular form the behaviour of true solution, suspension and colloidal solution. ","S. No. True Solution Colloidal Solution Suspension A true solution is a homogeneous A colloidal solution appears to be It is a heterogeneous mixture. mixture of solute and solvent. homogeneous but actually it is a heterogeneous mixture of solute and solvent.
