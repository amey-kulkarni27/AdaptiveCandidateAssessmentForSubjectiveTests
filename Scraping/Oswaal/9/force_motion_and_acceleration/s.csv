0,"Q. 1. In an experiment, to study the third law of motion using two spring balances, what does third law of motion state ?","Ans. The third law of motion states that when one object exerts a force on another object, the second object also exerts a force back on the first."
1,Q. 2. Can you give any example which shows third law of motion.,"Ans. When a person steps out of a boat, he pushes the boat backwards. But the reaction force of the boat pushes the man forward."
2,Q. 3. Give two properties of action and reaction forces.,Ans.  Both the forces are equal in magnitude  Both are applied in the opposite direction. 2
3,Q. 4. A body of mass 5 kg is moving along a straight line with a uniform velocity of 5m/s. What will be the external force acting on the body ?,Ans. An object moves with a uniform velocity when the force acting on the object is balanced and there is no net external force on it.
4,"Q. 5. In the experiment, using spring balances to study the third law of motion, mention any two precautions.",Ans.  Before making use of the two spring balances it should be ensured that their pointers are at zero mark.  The readings of the two spring balances should be noted only when their pointers come to rest.
