6,"Q. 10. Describe the structure of blood.  Blood corpuscles : Blood corpuscles or cells are of three types—RBCs, WBCs and Blood platelets.","Ans. Blood is a fluid connective tissue and consists of plasma and blood corpuscles.  Red Blood Cells  are also called erythrocytes and are bi-concave disc-like Plasma is a fluid matrix. It contains 85-90% water, structures devoid of nuclei in mammals. A about 7% proteins, 0.9% salts, 0.1% glucose and very network of protein and fat like compounds is small amounts of hormones. The blood corpuscles present throughout the cells. are suspended in the plasma. The most important functions of the RBC are transport of oxygen, aiding and transport of CO2 and the prevention of excessive acidity in the blood.  White Blood Corpuscles : They are also called leucocytes. They are comparatively smaller in size, semi-transparent, colourless and irregular in appearance. They are devoid of haemoglobin. WBCs are of two types—granulocytes and agranulocytes.  Blood platelets : They are about 2-4 µm in diameter and without any nucleus. Their main function is to liberate thromboplastin which causes blood clotting at the site of injury. 2 + 3"
