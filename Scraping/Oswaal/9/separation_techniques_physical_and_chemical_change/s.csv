The particles can be seen distinctly in a dispersion medium by the naked eye. What conclusion would you draw about the type of solution and its stability? Justify your conclusion. ,Particles of a suspension are visible to the naked eye. Suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solute particles do not dissolve but remain suspended throughout the bulk of medium. It is unstable as the solute particles settle down when it is left undisturbed.
"You are given three white powders one is of sodium chloride, second is of starch and third is of chalk. You are also provided with three beakers and distilled water. Using these materials identify the three powders. ","When the sodium chloride is dissolved in a beaker with distilled water, a true transparent solution is obtained. When starch is dissolved in dissolved water, a translucent colloid is formed. Lastly, when chalk powder is dissolved, an opaque suspension is formed."
"How are solution, suspension and colloid different from each other in terms of transparency and scattering of beam of light. Explain in tabular form. ",Solution Suspension Colloid Transpar- Transpar- Opaque ency ent Translucent Scatter of X beam of light Tyndall effect Tyndall effect  2
Identify two clear and transparent solutions from the following mixtures :  milk and water  sugar and water  chalk powder and water  starch powder and water  glucose and water ,Test-tube A has residue on filter paper and filtrate is clear solution. It is suspension. Test-tube B has no residue on filter paper and filtrate is clear solution. It is true solution. Test-tube C has no residue on filter paper and filtrate is translucent. It is colloidal solution. Test tube D has no residue on filter paper and filtrate is clear solution. It is true solution.  2
"Four students were asked to add water to glucose powder, milk, sand and soil separately in four beakers. Classify the mixtures as true solution, colloid and suspension. ","True solution : glucose powder with water Colloidal solution : milk with water Suspension : sand with water, soil with water.  2"
"Four students A, B, C and D are asked to prepare colloidal solutions. The following diagrams show the preparation done by them. Name the student, who will be able to prepare colloidal solutions. Write two properties of colloidal solution.  Starch Powder Sugar   Salt Egg  ",Student D will be able to prepare the colloidal solution as egg is not completely miscible in water. Two properties of colloidal solution are : 1. Particles of colloidal solutions cannot be separated. A colloidal solution appears to be homogeneous but actually it is a heterogeneous mixture of solute and solvent.  2
"In an experiment to separate the components of a mixture of sand, common salt and ammonium chloride, which component will be removed by filtration ?",Sand as it is insoluble in water.
"A mixture of ammonium chloride and sodium chloride heated in the apparatus of sublimation. After the experiment, at which place ammonium chloride will be obtained ?",It is obtained on the walls of the inverted funnel. 2
"While heating the mixture of sand, common salt and ammonium chloride in the experiment mention the residue left behind in the china dish ?","On heating the mixture, ammonium chloride will be obtained on the walls of the inverted funnel. The left behind in the china dish contains sand and common salt."
How does sand and common salt get separated in the experiment ?,"Common salt gets dissolved in water but the sand does not dissolve and settles down in water. Sand is filtered from the mixture by using filter paper. Sand is separated as residue and on heating the mixture, water evaporates and common salt is obtained. 2"
