You are given a mixture of alcohol and water. Explain the process to separate it into its constituents. Draw a labelled diagram of the technique used. ,"The process of separating alcohol and water is as follows : l Take the mixture in a distillation flask. l Fit it with a thermometers. l Arrangement of the apparatus is done as shown in the below given figure. l Heat the mixture slowly keeping a close watch at the thermometer. l The alcohol vapourises, condenses in the condenser and can be collected from the condenser outlet. l Water is left behind in the distillation flask. 5 Marks each mixtures containing a sublimable volatile component from a non-sublimable impurity i.e., sodium chloride, the sublimation process is used. Place the china dish over a wire gauze placed over a tripod stand. Cover the china dish with an inverted glass funnel and plug in a little cotton at the opening stem. On heating the mixture, white fumes evolve. Stop heating when the fumes stop rising and allow the funnel to cool. On cooling, remove the funnel and transfer the solid ammonium chloride sticking on the walls of funnel to a watch glass. Cotton plug Thermometer Inverted funnel Water outlet Clamp Water condenser Clamp Distillation flask Vapours of ammonium chloride Solidified ammonium chloride Cold water in Mixture of acetone and water Mixture of ammonium chloride and salt China dish Acetone"
 How can we separate a mixture of sodium chloride and ammonium chloride ? Draw a labelled diagram to show the set up for the process.  Name two more substances which can be separated from their mixture by the above method. ," Ammonium chloride changes directly from solid to gaseous state on heating. So, to separate  Camphor and naphthalene."
Write your observation when the following processes take place  an aqueous solution of sugar is heated to dryness.  a saturated solution of potassium chloride prepared at 60°C is allowed to cool at room temperature. IS MATTER AROUND US PURE ?  a mixture of iron filings and sulphur powder is heated strongly.  A beam of light is passed through a colloidal solution. S. Physical change No.  These are reversible changes and their chemical composition do not change.  dil–HCl is added to the mixture of iron and sulphur. , Sugar remains as residue in the form of a solid mass.  Potassium chloride crystallises out.  A black coloured compound is formed.  The path of the light becomes visible.  A colourless gas is evolved.  1+ 1+ 1+ 1 + 1 Chemical change These are irreversible changes and the chemical composition also changes.  No new substance is New substance is formed. e.g. Tearing of formed. e.g. Burning a paper. match-stick.
Which separation techniques you will apply for the separtion of the following mixtures :  Oil from water  Camphor from sand  Sodium chloride from its solution in water  Metal pieces from engine oil of a car  Cream from milk , Separating funnel  Sublimation  Evaporation  Filtration / using magnet  Centrifugation  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
 Mention any two differences between physical and chemical changes. Give one example of each.  List any two properties for each of the following case of metals which make them suitable to be used as : 		 Utensils for cooking food  Explain the above technique.  Which principle is used in it ?  Complete the diagram with proper labelling.   Give its two applications.  ," Physical change : reversible change, chemical composition do not change, no new substance is formed. Chemical change : irreversibe change, chemical composition changes, new substance is formed.  Example–Tearing a paper–physical change Burning a match stick–chemical change   Metals are malleable and good conductors of heat. 		 Metals are ductile and good conductors of electricity.  3 + 2 Detailed Answer :  Difference between physical and chemical changes : liquid of less density  liquid of more density    It is used to separate oil from water and carbon disulphide from water. "
Define distillation. What type of mixture can be separated by distillation ? Draw a labelled diagram of the apparatus used for fractional distillation.  How can we separate a mixture of two miscible liquids. Describe the process. , Chromatography. Thermometer Cork Water condenser Stand  Give a reason for the rise of coloured spot on the paper strip.  Different colours will appear at different heights.  Different colours have different rates of absorption.  Applications : To separate colours in a dye; To separate drugs from blood. Receiver  
 Name the separation techniques which you will apply for the separation of the following mixtures :  Small pieces of metal in the engine oil of a car.  Fine mud particles suspended in water.  Oil from water.  Sodium chloride from its solution in water.  Camphor from salt.  Wheat grains from husk.  Classify the following as a chemical or physical change :  Water boils to form steam.  Burning of paper.  An almirah gets rusted.  Making a fruit salad with raw fruits. ,  Filtration. 		 Sedimentation and Decantation. 		 Separating funnel. 		 Evaporation. 		 Sublimation. 		 Winnowing.   Water boils to form steam : Physical change. 		 Burning of paper : Chemical change. 		 An almirah gets rusted : Chemical change. 		 Making a fruit salad with raw fruits : Physical change.
With a neat labelled diagram explain the process used for separating acetone and water from their mixture. List two criteria that must be fulfilled for using this process. ,"Thermometer Cork Water outlet Clamp Water condenser Stand Distillation flask Cold water in Mixture of acetone and water Acetone Activity : Take the mixture in a distillation flask. Fit it with a thermometer. Arrange the apparatus as shown in figure. Heat the mixture slowly keeping a close watch at the thermometer. The acetone vapourizes, condenses in the condenser and can be collected from the condenser outlet. Water is left behind in the distillation flask. Criterion : Two miscible liquids that boil without decomposition and have sufficient difference in their boiling points can be separated by this method."
 What is saturated solution ? How solubility in a solution can be increased ? IS MATTER AROUND US PURE ?  Draw a flow chart to explain water purification system in water works. , Saturated solution is the one which contains maximum amount of solute dissolved in a given quantity of the solvent at a given temperature. By increasing the temperature.  Reservoir sedimentation tank to allow solids to settle Loading tank to sediment the suspended impurities Filtration tank Chlorination to kill bacteria Supply 
" Define sublimation and sedimentation.  You are provided with a mixture of ammonium chloride, common salt, sand and iron filings. Which of these substances can be separated by sublimation and which by sedimentation ?  Can salt be separated by sedimentation ? Justify your answer. "," Sublimation is a process in which a solid is directly converted into vapour state on heating and vice versa. Sedimentation is a process of settling down of solid particles at the bottom in a mixture of solid and liquid.  Ammonium chloride by sublimation. Sand and iron filings by sedimentation.  No, because the common salt dissolves in water.  2 + 2 + 1"
Mention in sequential order the steps involved in separating the components of air by fractional distillation. Name two main components of air and also give their percentage in air. Which gas is liquified first as the air is cooled and why ? ,  Compress and cool by increasing pressure and decreasing temperature.  Allow to warm up slowly in fractional distillation column.  Gases get separated at different heights. Two main components : Oxygen 21% and Nitrogen 78%. Oxygen gets liquified first because its boiling point is higher than that of the other components. 		  2 + 2 + 1
Show diagrammatically how water is purified in the waterworks system and list the processes involved.,"Sedimentation Tank Reservoir To sediment the To allow solids suspended impurities to settle Sedimentation tank Loading tank Fine sand Water Gravel Coarse gravel Filtration tank To home Chlorination to kill bacteria Water purification system in water works Processes involved : Sedimentation, Loading, Filtration and Chlorination."
