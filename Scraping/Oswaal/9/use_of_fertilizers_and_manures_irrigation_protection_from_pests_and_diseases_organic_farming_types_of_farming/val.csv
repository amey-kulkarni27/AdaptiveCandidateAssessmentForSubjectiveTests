Mention the advantages of such a farming system.  What is the main problem in such a form of fish farming ? How do farmers overcome such problems ?"," Composite fish culture.  In such a system, a combination of five or six fish species is bred in a single fish pond. These species are selected so that they do not compete for food among them. As a result, food available in all parts of the pond is used. This increases the fish yield from the pond.  Most of the fish breed in monsoon only and even if fish seed is collected from wild it can be mixed with other species as well. So major problem is lack of availability of good food. This problem can be overcomed by breeding these fishes using hormonal stimulation."
Shruti attended an agriculture workshop organised by her school. Her father also has an agricultural farm. She saw in the workshop the harmful effects of spraying pesticides on the crops. She came back to home and tried to convince her father to stop using pesticides.  Mention the harmful effects of using pesticides as conveyed by Shruti to her father.

So, when the crops sprayed by pesticides are consumed by humans, they get stored in their system and create problems for them. 		 Pesticides are also poisonous for some plants. This affects the plant growth and plant yield. 		 Pesticides should be used in appropriate quantities. Large amounts can be very problematic. 		 Pesticides cause environmental pollution.  Alternative Method : Organic Farming Shruti encouraged her father to do organic farming, which is a farming system involving minimal use of chemicals as fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides etc. and with maximum input of organic manures."
Farmer ‘X’ planted Soyabean + Maize + Cowpeas in the same field simultaneously in a set row pattern. Farmer ‘Y’ planted cereal crop in one season and leguminous plants in next season on the same piece of land in preplanned succession.  Name the cropping pattern used by farmers ‘X’ and ‘Y’.  State two advantages of different cropping patterns followed by farmers ‘X’ and ‘Y’ respectively., X – Inter-cropping pattern. Y – Crop rotation.  Inter-cropping ensures maximum utilization of the nutrients supplied and prevents pests and diseases from spreading to all plants belonging to one crop. Crop rotation replenishes soil with different nutrients. Two or three crops can be grown in a year with good harvests.
