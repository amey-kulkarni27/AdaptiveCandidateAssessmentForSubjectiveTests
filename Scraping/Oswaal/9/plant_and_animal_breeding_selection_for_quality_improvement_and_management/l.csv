State the meaning of sustainable agriculture. Name the scientific practices that you can undertake to obtain higher yield from agriculture. ,Definition of sustainable agriculture.  Mixed farming  Intercropping  Crop rotation 
"Describe briefly about the traits and their utilities important for a cereal crop in improvement of varieties. , "," Higher Yield : To increase the productivity of crop per acre.  Improved Quality : Quality considerations such as baking quality, protein quality, oil quality and preserving quality of crop products vary from crop to crop.  Biotic and Abiotic Resistance : Crop production can go down due to biotic and abiotic stresses under different situations. Varieties resistant to these stresses can improve crop production.  Change in Maturity Duration : The shorter the duration of the crop from sowing to harvesting, the more economical is the variety. 		 Culture fishery is a way of fish farming and capture fishery is obtaining the fish from natural resources.  Problem associated with composite fish culture is lack of availability of good seed. 		  1 + 1 + 1 5 Marks each  Wider Adaptability : Developing varieties for wider adaptability will help in stabilising the crop production under different environmental conditions.  Desirable Agronomic Characteristics : Developing varieties of desired agronomic characters helps to give higher productivity. 5"
Mention the type of loss caused by inappropriate conditions of moisture and temperature prevailing during storage of grains. , Degradation of quality  Loss in weight  Poor germinability  Discolouration of produce.  Poor marketability. 
" What are genetically modified crops ?  Name four factors for which variety improvement is done.  Write any two ways to control weeds. , "," Genetically modified crop : In this method, a gene that would provide the desired characteristics is introduced into the crop.  Some of the factors for which crop variety improvement is done are :  Higher Yield : Variety improvement has been done to increase the productivity of the crop per acre. This is very important in order to meet food demand for rapidly growing population.  Improved Quality : The definition of quality is different for different crops e.g., baking quality is important in wheat, protein quality in pulses, oil quality in oil seeds and preserving qualities in fruits and vegetable. 		 Wider Adaptability : Varieties that can grow under any condition and can adapt themselves to various environmental conditions, help in stabilizing the crop production.  Biotic and Abiotic Resistance : Biotic factors like  and abiotic factors  affect crop production a lot. Varieties resistant to such factors are always preferred and improve crop production.  Two ways to control weeds : 		 Preventive methods : Proper seed bed preparation, timely sowing of crops, intercropping and crop rotation. 		 Chemical methods : Spraying of herbicides or weedicides. E.g., Atrazine. 2, 4 - D."
 Write any two advantages of composite fish farming.   Name the two components of cattle feed and their function.  Name any two milch breeds of cow. ," Two advantages of composite fish farming are : 		 A combination of five or six fish species is used in single fish pond. 		 Fish species have different food habits. Different food habits are advantageous, as all the food in the pond is consumed by the fish.  Two components of cattle feed are : 		 Roughage : This is largely fibrous, containing low nutrients. e.g., green fodder, silage hay and legumes. 		 Concentrates : These are low in fibre and contain relatively high levels of proteins and other nutrients. e.g., cereals like gram and bajra.  Two milch breeds of cow are Jersey and Brown swiss."
" Why do cattle need a balanced diet ?  How many nutrients are essential for plants ?  List the nutrients supplied by air, water and soil. "," Balanced diet promotes the health and milk output of dairy animals.  16 nutrients.  Nutrients supplied by : Air – Carbon, oxygen, Water – Hydrogen, oxygen, Soil – Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium together with other macro & micronutrients. 		  1 + 1 + 3"
" How do the following factors improve the crop yield ?  shorten maturity duration,  biotic and abiotic resistance,  wider adaptability.  Define two methods of improving crop variety. ",  Multiple rounds of crops a year. 		 Crops can withstand stress due to biotic and abiotic factors and thus result in good production. 		 Crops can be grown under different climatic conditions.  Hybridization : Crossing between genetically dissimilar plants. Gene manipulation : Inserting gene of desired character in a progeny. 
" What are the common names of Apis dorsata, Apis florae and Apis cerena indica ?  Name one Italian bee variety. Also justify the use of Italian bee for honey production giving two reasons.  State one factor which affects the quality of honey produced. "," A. dorsata : Rock bee, A. florae : Little bee, A. cerena indica : Indian bee.  Apis mellifera Reasons for using Italian bees for honey production :  High honey collecting capacity 		 Sting less 		 Stays in bee hive for long periods 		 Breeds very well   Kind of flower available. ½ × 3+ ½ + 2 + 1 "
" Classify the following as food or fodder crop : Wheat, barseem, oats, black gram.  List the two ways of incorporating desirable characters into crop varieties.  State two desirable agronomic characteristics for crop improvement. "," Wheat, Black gram – food crop. Barseem, Oats – fodder crop.  By hybridization and by introduction of gene.  Tallness and profuse branching are desirable characteristics in fodder crops and dwarfness is desirable in cereals so that fewer nutrients are consumed by these crops. "
" Classify the following as Rabi or Kharif crops : Paddy, Soyabean, Wheat, and Mustard.  Why are certain crops grown in a particular season? Give two reasons.  Explain how is green manure formed. "," Paddy, Soyabean – Kharif crop. Wheat, Mustard – Rabi crop.  As different crops require different photoperiod, climatic conditions and temperature.   Prior to the sowing of crop seeds, some plants like sun hemp or guar are grown and then mulched by ploughing them into soil. These plants turn into green manure. "
