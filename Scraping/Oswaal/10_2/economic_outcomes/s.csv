0,Q. 1. Are democracies based on political and economic equalities ? Explain.,"Ans. Democracy are based on political equality.  All citizens have equal role in electing representatives.  Parallel to the process of bringing individuals into the political arena, we find growing economic inequalities.  Democracy does not appear to be very successful in reducing economic inequalities.  The ultra-rich enjoy a highly disproportionate share of wealth and income.  At the bottom of the society, the people have very little to depend on.  It is difficult to meet their basic needs of life, such as food, clothing, house, education and health."
1,Q. 2. How democracies have been able to reduce poverty ? Elaborate. ,"Ans.  Democracies do not appear to be very successful in reducing economic inequalities. Although majority of voters constitute the poverty ridden group, yet democratically elected government do not appear to be as keen to address the question of poverty as you would expect them to.  Situation is much worse in some of the countries where people depend upon rich countries for food supplies.  But even then democracy is favoured because it provides the opportunity to change the rulers. "
