"Uneducated and careless people are not aware of saving fossil fuels, such as, coal and petroleum. Discuss some points how you can make them aware regarding this ?","All fossil fuels are in limited quantity. Thus we need a very judicious use of these fuels. For this, we must find out some alternative sources of energy as solar energy, water energy, geothermal energy etc. We must ask them to reduce unnecessary use of vehicles i.e., If four people are going from one place to single destination, they should use only one vehicle rather than more than one."
