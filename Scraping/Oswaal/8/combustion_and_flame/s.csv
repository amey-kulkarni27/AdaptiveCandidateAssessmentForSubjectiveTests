0,Q. 1. What are the characteristics of an ideal fuel ? Characteristics of an ideal fuel :,Ans.  It is readily available.  It is cheap.
1,Q. 2. Which zone of a flame does a goldsmith use for melting gold and silver and why ? ,"Ans. Goldsmiths blow the outer most zone of a flame with a metallic blow-pipe for melting gold and silver, because it is the hottest part of the flame."
2,Q. 3. Make a labelled diagram of a candle flame.,Ans. Hottest part Moderately hot Least hot Outer zone of complete combustion  Middle zone of partial combustion  Innermost zone of unburnt wax vapours  Fig. Candle Flame
3,Q. 4. Compare LPG and woods as fuels. ,"Ans. Distinguish between LPG and wood.     Wood It is a gaseous fuel. It does not produce smoke . No residue after burning. Can be transported through pipe-lines, and cylinder. It is a solid fuel. It produces smoke. Leaves a lot of ash on burning. Cannot be transported easily like LPG."
4,Q. 5. When the clothes of a person catch fire the person is covered with a blanket to extinguish fire. Why ?,"Ans. When the clothes of a person catch fire the person is covered with a blanket to extinguish fire because blanket cuts off the supply of air, that is the supporter of fire."
5,Q. 6. Why is it very difficult to control forest fire ?,"Ans. During extreme heat in the hot summer days, at some places dry grass catches fire. It is because the heat is sufficient to attain ignition temperature of grass. From grass, it spreads to trees and very soon the whole forest is on fire. It is called forest fire. It is very difficult to control forest fire. As fire spreads at a very high spead and in a very large area, it is very difficult to control it."
6,"Q. 7. When kerosene oil is heated a little, it will catches fire. But when wood is heated a little, it does not catch fire. Why ?","Ans. If kerosene oil is heated a little, it catches fire. But if wood is heated a little, it does not catch fire because ignition temperature of kerosene oil is lower than that of wood."
7,"Q. 8. Two paper cups, one with water in it and one empty, are heated carefully on candle flame.  What will happen to both the cups ?  Why ?","Ans.  The cup containing water will not burn whereas the empty paper cup will burn rapidly.  Because the heat supplied to the paper cup is transferred to water by conduction. So, in the presence of water, the ignition temperature of paper is not reached. Hence, it does not burn. On the other hand the empty paper ’s ignition temperature is low and it burns rapidly."
8,Q. 9. Why is water used by fire brigade to extinguish fire ?,Ans. Water is used by fire brigade to extinguish fire as water cools the combustible material so that its temperature is brought below its ignition temperature. This prevents the fire from spreading.
9,Q. 10. Name two substances that burn with flame and without flame ?,"Ans. Substances that burn with flame are candle, oil lamp. Substances that burn without flame are coal, charcoal."
10,Q. 2. Explain how CO2 is able to control fire ? ,"Ans. For fires, involving electrical equipments and inflammable materials like petrol, carbon dioxide is the best extinguishers. CO2 being heavier than oxygen, covers the fire like a blanket. Since, the contact between the fuel and oxygen is cutoff, the fire is controlled."
11,Q. 2. It is difficult to burn a heap of green leaves but dry leaves catch fire easily. Explain. ,"Ans. It is difficult to burn heap of green leaves because they have moisture in them, which increases their ignition temperature. On the other hand, dry leaves have low ignition temperature and thus burn easily."
12,"Q. 2. In an experiment 4.5 kg of a fuel was completely burnt. The heat, produced, was measured to be 180,000 kJ. Calculate the calorific value of the fuel. ","Ans. Heat produced by burning 4.5 kg fuel = 180, 000 kJ. Heat produced by burning 1 kg fuel kJ kJ = 40,000 kJ.  Calorific value of fuel = 40,000 kJ/kg. 2"
13,Q. 5. Can the process of rusting be called Combustion ? Discuss. ,"Ans. Process of rusting cannot be called combustion because during the process of rusting no heat and light is evolved, and moreover iron in not an inflammable substance."
14,Q. 2. What is acid rain ? Describe.,"Ans. Burning of coal and diesel releases sulphur dioxide gas. It is an extremely suffocating and corrosive gas. Moreover, petrol engine gives off gaseous oxides of nitrogen. Oxides of sulphur and nitrogen dissolve in rain water and form acids. Such rain is called acid rain."
15,"Q. 2. In many rural parts of India, people still use wood as a fuel. Why ? What are its disadvantages ?","Ans. In many rural parts of our country, people still use wood as a fuel because of its easy availability and low cost. Its disadvantages are :  It gives a lot of smoke, that is harmful for living beings.  It causes respiratory problems.  Trees provide us with useful substances, which are lost when wood is used as fuel."
16,Q. 2. Explain briefly different types of combustion.,"Ans. Types of combustion—It is of three types : Rapid combustion—When gases burn rapidly to produce heat and light, it is called rapid combustion. Spontaneous combustion—When material suddenly bursts into flames, without the application of any apparent cause, it is called spontaneous combustion. Explosion—When combustion takes place with sudden release of heat, sound, light and gas with a bang it is called explosion. 1×3=3"
17,Q. 2. How a match stick burns. Explain its process.,"Ans. These days the head of the match sticks contains only antimony trisulphide and potassium chlorate. The rubbing surface has powdered glass and a little red phosphorus. When the matchstics is struck against the rubbing surface i.e., some red phosphorus, this immediately reacts with potassium chlorate on the match stick head to produce enough heat to ignite antimony trisulphide and start combustion."
