Explain the harmful effects of burning fuels.,"The harmful effects of burning fuels :  Fuels like wood, coal, petroleum etc. which are carbon fuels, produce unburnt carbon particles, which cause respiratory diseases  and skin diseases.  Generally CO 2 is released during burning of fuels. It causes the rise in the temperature of the atmosphere of Earth, which is called global warm-ing.  Incomplete combustion of fuel releases many poisonous gases such as carbon monoxide. It can kill people sleeping in a room containing carbon monoxide.  Combustion of coal and diesel generates sulphur dioxide. It is a corrosive gas and it causes suffocation.  Burning of fuels releases oxides of nitrogen and sulphur. They dissolve in rain water and form acid. Such rain is called acid rain. It is harmful to crops, buildings and soil."
