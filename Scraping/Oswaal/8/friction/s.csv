questions,answers
How many types of friction are there ?,There are three types of friction :  Static  Sliding  Rolling
Why is it difficult to move on a wet marble floor ?,It is difficult to move on a wet marble floor because wet floor reduces the friction and it becomes slippery.
Why are the tyres of cars and trucks treaded ?,The treaded tyres of cars and trucks provide better grip on the road.
Why do kabaddi players rub their hands with soil ?,Because their hands become rough with soil and they get better grip on their opponents.
Give two examples where friction is undesirable., We sprinkle fine powder on carrom board to reduce friction.  Drops of oil are poured on the hinges of a door so that the door moves smoothly.
What do you mean by lubricants ?,"The substances which reduce friction are called lubricants. e.g., oil, creams and grease. 2"
What is a drag ?,The frictional force exerted by fluids is called drag.
When does rolling friction come into play ?,"When a body rolls on other body, rolling friction comes into play."
Name two methods of reducing friction with examples.,Two methods of reducing friction :  Rolling : The rolling wheels attached to luggage bags make it comfortable for passengers to carry them because rolling reduces friction and is smaller than sliding friction.  Sliding : By polishing surfaces or by applying a lubricant.
What does frictional force exerted on an object in a fluid depend on ?,"Frictional force on an object in a field depends on the speed with respect to the fluid and the nature of fluid. It also depends on the shape of the object. e.g., all vehicles are designed to have shapes that reduce fluid friction. Shape of boats and ships is streamlined."
What is the cause of friction ?,Friction is caused by the irregularities on the two surfaces in contact. Even those surfaces that appear smooth have a large number of irregularities in them. The irregularity on the two surfaces lock each surface into one another.
You spill a bucket of soapy water on a marble floor accidently. Would this make it easier or more difficult for you to walk on the floor ? Why ? ,A bucket of soapy water spills on a marble floor accidently. It is difficult to walk on it. The soap on floor reduces the friction and the foot is unable to make a proper grip on the floor and it starts glippind on the floor.
Explain why sportsmen use shoes with spikes. ,Sports men use shoes with spike to increase the friction so that the shoes do not slip while they run or play.
Explain why objects moving in fluids must have special shapes. ,"When objects move through fluids, they have to overcome friction acting on them. In this process they lose energy. Objects are given special shapes that would make them lose less energy in over-coming friction. Stream lined shape is the shape that overcomes the friction of fluid easily."
Explain why sliding friction is less than static friction. ,"Sliding friction is always less than static friction. As two sliding objects find less time to get interlocked against each other, so they get less friction."
Mention three examples that show that friction produces heat.,Following examples show that friction produces heat :  Warming of our palms when we rub them.  Jar of mixer becomes hot when it runs.  Warming of the parts of a machine when it is operated.
Friction is called a necessary evil. Why ?,"Friction is called a necessary evil because we cannot do anything without friction and it also shows effects. No movement would come to an end without friction. No body would rest without friction. We cannot write with pen or pencil if there is no friction. If an object starts moving, it would never stop if there was no friction. It is also necessary for grip and bringing movements to rest."
