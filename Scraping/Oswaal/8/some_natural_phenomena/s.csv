questions,answers
What is earthing ? What is its importance ?,The process of transferring of charge from a charged object to the earth is called earthing. It is provided in buildings to protect us from electrical shocks due to any leakage of electric current.
What is an earthquake ? What is its cause ?,"An earthquake is a sudden shaking or trembling of the earth, which lasts for a very short time."
What are seism or fault zones ?,Since earthquakes are caused by the movement of plates the boundaries of the plates are the weak zones where earthquake occurs. These weak zones are also known as seismic or fault zones.
"Sometime, a crackling sound is heard while taking off a sweater during winters. ","A crackling sound occurs when we are taking off sweater during winters because there is a electric discharge between sweater and body due to rubbing. Some energy is always released with electric discharge, in the form of crack-ling sound."
Explain why a charged body loses its charges if we touch it with our hand. ,"When we touch a charged body, it loses its charge due to earthing. Our body is also a good conductor of electricity. It transfers the charge to the earth through our body."
Name the scale on which the destructive energy of an earthquake is measured. An earthquake measures 3 on the scale. Would it be recorded by a seismograph ? Is it likely to cause much damage ? ,Destructive energy of an earthquake is measured by Richter scale. An earthquake measures 3 on the scale can be recorded on this scale. Earthquake with magnitude 3 will not be so destructive.
Explain why a charged balloon is repelled by another charged balloon whereas an uncharged balloon is attracted by another charged balloon.,Charged balloon is repelled by another charged balloon because both carry same charge. Where as uncharged balloon is attracted by charged balloon due to unlike charges.
List three states in India where earth quakes are more likely to strike.,"Kashmir, Rajasthan, Gujarat."
What are the causes of sparking ?,Tue causes of sparking are :  On electric pole wire when get loose.  Breaking of electric wire during thunder strorm.  Loose connection between plug and socket.
What are lightning safety measures ?,"During lightning and thunderstorm no open place is safe. — Hearing thunder is an alert to rush to a safer place. — After hearing the last thunder, wait for sometime before coming out of the safe place."
Write Do’s and Don’ts during a thunderstorm.,"Outside the house : — Open vehicles, such as motor bikes, tractors, construction machinery, open cars are not safe. — Open fields, tall trees, shelters in park, elevated place do not protect us from lightning strokes. — Carrying an umbrella is also not safe. — Stay away from poles or other metal objects. Inside the house : — During a thunderstorm contact with telephone cords, electrical wires and metal pipes should be avoided. — It is safe to use mobile phone. — Bathing should be avoided. — Electrical appliances like computers, TVs etc should be unplugged. Electrical lights can remain on."
What are lightning conductors ? How it is used ?,"Lightning conductors are the devices used to protect buildings from the effect of lightning. It is a metallic rod, taller than the building, installed in the walls of the buildings during its construction. One end of the rod is kept out in the air and the other is buried deep in the ground. The rod provides easy route for the transfer of electric charge to the ground."
What are seismic waves ? How it can be measured ?,"The tremor produces waves on the surface of the earth.These waves are called seismic waves. The waves are recorded by an instrument called the seismograph. This instrument is simply a vibrating rod or a pendulum, which starts vibrating when tremors occur. A pen is attached to the vibrating system that records the seismic waves on a paper. By studying these waves, scientists can construct a complete map of the earthquake. 3"
Describe with the help of a diagram an instrument which can be used to detect a charged body. ,"Electroscope is a device used to detect the presence of charge on an object. — It acts on the principle that like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. — An electroscope has a metal rod with thin metal strip or leaf attached to its bottom. At the top, the rod enters into the glass box. — Charge a refill and touch its top part. When metal strips receive the same charge from the charged refill, they repel each other. Metallic cup Metal rod Metal strips Fig. Electroscope — When they attract each other, it means that a refill charge is opposite charge. Hence, this device can be used to detect whether an object is carrying charge or not. Either they are same or opposite charges."
