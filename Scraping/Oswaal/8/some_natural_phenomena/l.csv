Explain the mechanism of thunder storms.,"Mechanism of thunderstrom or the story of lightning : During the development of a thunderstorm, the air current moves up- wards while the water droplets move downwards. These vigorous movement cause separation of charges. By a process, the positive charges collect near the upper edges of the clouds and the negative charges accumulate near the lower edges. There is accumulation of the charges near the ground also. When the magnitude of accumulated charges becomes very large, negative and positive charges meet. It produces streaks of light and sound. This process is called electric discharge."
