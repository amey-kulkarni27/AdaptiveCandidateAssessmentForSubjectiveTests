0,Q. 1. A pendulum oscillates 40 times in 4 sec. Find its time period and frequency. ,Ans. Time period = t No of oscillations 40 Frequency = No of oscillations 40 Time = 10 Hertz. 2
1,Q. 2. The sound from a mosquito is produced when it vibrates its wings at an average rate of 500 vibrations per second. What is the time period of the vibration ? ,Ans. Time period =  0.002 sec.
2,Q. 3. Sketch larynx and explain its function. ,"Ans. In humans, the sound is produced by the voice box or the larynx. Fig. : Voice box in humans Functioning : It is the upper end of the wind pipe. Two vocal cords are stretched across the voice box. It leaves a narrow slit between them for the passage of air. When the lungs force air through the slit, the vocal cords vibrate, producing sound."
3,"Q. 4. Why are the voices of men, women and children are different ?","Ans. The vocal cords in men are about 20 mm long. In women these are about 5 mm shorter. Children have very short vocal cords. This is the reason that why the voices of men, women and children are different."
4,Q. 5. Compare the sound of drum and whistle.,"Ans. The frequency determines the shrillness or pitch of a sound. A drum vibrates with low frequency. Therefore, it produces low pitched sound. Whistle has a high frequency and therefore, produces a sound of higher pitch. 2"
5,Q. 6. Sound needs a medium for propagation. Explain it with an experiment.,Ans. Sound needs a medium for propagation. Take a metal or glass tumbler. Place a cellphone in it. Ask your friend to give a ring on this cellphone. Listen to the ring carefully. Now surround the rim of the tumbler with your hands. Suck all the air in the tumbler. Once again make a ring in cellphone. Sound will completely stop because air has been removed completely from the vessel and form vacuum. Hence sound needs a medium for propagation.
6,Q. 7. What is the difference between noise and musical sound ?,Ans. Unpleasant sounds are called noise and the sounds that seem pleasing to the ear is called musical sound.
7,Q. 8. What is ultrasound ? What are its uses ?,"Ans. Sound frequencies higher than 20,000 Hz are called ultrasound. It is used as diagnostic"
8,Q. 9. What are the harms of noise pollution ? ,Ans. Harms of noise pollution : Presence of excessive noise in the surrounding area may cause. — Lack of sleep. Hypertension . Anxiety and other health disorders. Temporary or even permanent impairment of hearing.
9,Q. 10. What is noise pollution ?,"Ans. Presence of unwanted and excessive sounds in the environment is called noise pollution. It causes discomfort to us. Excessive sounds are produced by horns, loudspeakers, crackers and machines."
10,Q. 1. Which part of the following objects vibrate when sound is produced.  Ringing of a sound bell.  Buzzing of insects.  Bursting of balloon.  Brushing of table.  Playing a sitar.  Dholak.  Sitar.  Flute.,Ans.  Vibration of metal surface.  Flapping of wings.  Air vibrates to produce sound.  Vibrations of membrane.  Vibration of string.  Stretched membrane.  Strings.  Air column.
11,Q. 2. What is hearing impairment ? How do people over come this problem ?,"Ans. Hearing impairment means not able to hear properly. Partial disability is generally the result of a disease, injury or age. Children with impaired hearing need special care by learning sign language. Technological devices for the hearing impaired have made it possible for such person to improve their quality of life."
12,Q. 3. What is frequency ? How does it affect the quality of sounds ?,"Ans. The number of oscillations per second is called frequency. Its unit is Hertz. Frequency determines the shrillness of sounds. It is also called pitch of sound. The high frequency makes the high pitch and if the pitch is low, the frequency is less. High pitched sound  is shrill whereas low pitched sound  is hoarse. 3"
13,Q. 4.  Define an oscillation ?  Hertz,Ans.  Oscillation : The to and fro motion of an object is called vibration. This motion is also called oscillatory motion.  The number of oscillations per second is called the frequency in Hertz . A frequency of 1 Hz is one oscillation per second. 
14,Q. 5. What do you mean by vacuum ? What happens to the loudness of sound in vacuum ?,"Ans. The decreasing amount of air decreases loudness of sound. When air is removed completely from a vessel, it is said that there is a vacuum. If all air is sucked from the vessel the sound would stop completely. The sound cannot travel through a vacuum. Pinna Hammer Anvil Stirrup Oval window Auditory nerve Cochlea Tympanic membrane or eardrum Auditory canal Eustachian tube Outer ear Middle Inner ear ear Fig. : Human Ear"
15,Q. 6. Explain the structure of human ear and its functions.,"Ans. Structure and function of human ear : The hearing organs in humans are ears. It is divided into three parts—outer, inner and middle ear. Middle ear has a stretched structure called ear drum. When ears receive sound, it enters down the ear canal and reaches eardrum. Sound vibrations, vibrates the eardrum and it sends vibrations to inner ear from which vibrations are sent to the brain for interpretation of sound."
16,Q. 7. Name three bones present in the middle ear.,Ans. Malleus Incus Stapes .
17,Q. 8. Write two functions of human ears.,Ans.  They help us in listening any sound.  They act as balancing organs.
