0,Q. 2. Amoeba reproduces by which process ? Explain in brief.,"Ans. Amoeba reproduces by asexual reproduction, binary fission. It begins the process of reproduction by the division of its nucleus in two nuclei. This is followed by division of its body into two, where each part receives a nucleus. Finally two amoebae are produced from one parent amoeba."
1,Q. 3. What is Metamorphosis ? ,Ans. The transformation of the larva into an adult through drastic changes is called metamorphosis.
2,Q. 4. Write difference between viviparous and oviparous animals.,"Ans. Difference between viviparous and oviparous : Viviparous The animals that give birth to young ones are called viviparous animals. e.g., Human beings, Cats, dogs. Oviparous The animals that lay eggs are called oviparous animals. e.g., Frogs, fishes."
3,Q. 5. How is egg formed in the hen ?,"Ans. After fertilization, the zygote divides repeatedly and travels down the oviduct. As it travels down, many protective layers are formed around it. The hard shell is formed"
4,Q. 6. Write difference between internal fertilization and external fertilization. ,"Ans. External Fertilization Internal fertilization Fertilization that takes place inside the female body is called internal fertilization. e.g., Human, cats, Dogs. Fertilization in which the fusion of a male and a female gamete takes place outside the body of the female is called extenal fertilization. e.g., fish, star fish etc."
5,Q. 7. What is IVF ?,"Ans. IVF is In-vitro fertilization. In such cases the doctor collects freshly released egg and sperm and keep them together for a few hours for fertilization. When fertilization occurs, the zygote is formed and allowed to develop for about a week and then, it is placed in the motherâ€™s uterus. Babies born through this technique are called test-tube baby."
6,Q. 9. Explain the structure of male reproductive system in human beings.,"Ans. Male reproductive system : The male reproductive organs include a pair of testes, two sperm ducts and a penis. The testes produce the male gametes called sperms. Millions of sperms are produced by the testes."
7,Q. 2. Why the new individual inherits some characteristics from the mother and some from the father ?,Ans. The process of fertilization is the meeting of an egg cell from the mother and a sperm cell from the father. So the new individual inherits some characteristics from the mother and some from the father.
8,Q. 3. How does external fertilization takes place ? Explain with an example.,"Ans. Fertilization in which the fusion of a male and a female gamete takes place outside the body of a female is called external fertilization. It is very common in aquatic animals. During spring or rainy season, frogs and toads move to ponds and slow flowing streams. When the male and female come together in water, the female lays hundreds of eggs. A layer of jelly holds the eggs together and provides protection to the eggs. The male deposits sperm over them. The sperms come in contact with the eggs. This results in fertilization."
9,Q. 4. Why do fishes and frogs lay eggs in hundreds ?,"Ans. This is because the eggs and sperms get exposed to water movement, wind and rainfall. There are other animals in the pond, which may feed on eggs. Thus production of large number of eggs and sperms is necessary to ensure fertilization of atleast a few of them. 3"
10,Q. 5. Define asexual reproduction. Describe two methods of asexual reproduction. ,"Ans. Reproduction in which only a single parent is involved is called asexual reproduction. Two methods of asexual reproduction.   Budding  Binary fission  Budding : In hydra there may be one or more bulges. These bulges are developing new individuals and they are called buds. When new individuals develop from the buds, it is called budding.  Binary fission : The process of reproduction by the division of its nucleus into two nuclei. This is followed by division of its body into two where each part receives a nucleus as it finally two amoebae are produced."
