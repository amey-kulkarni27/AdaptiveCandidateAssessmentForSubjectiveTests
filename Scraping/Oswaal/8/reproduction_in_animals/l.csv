Explain the process of reproduction in human beings with suitable diagrams.,"Reproduction in human beings : In human, internal reproduction takes place. There are two sexes in human beingsâ€”male & female. Male reproductive parts include a pair of testes, two sperm ducts and a penis. The testes produce the sperms. The female reproductive organs are a pair of ovaries, oviduct and the Uterus Ovary Zygote Embedding embryo Fig. Reproduction in Human Beings uterus. The ovary produces female gametes called ova. Fusion of the egg and the sperm is called fertilization. This results in the formation of a fertilized egg or zygote. Zygote begins to develop into an embryo. The zygote repeatedly gives rise to a ball of cells. The cells then begin to form groups and organs of the body which form embryo. The stage of the embryo in which all the body parts can be identified is called foetus. When the development of the foetus is complete, the mother gives birth to the baby."
What are clones ? What are the various steps of this process ? Explain with examples.,"Cloning is the production of an exact copy of a cell; any other living part, or a complete organism. Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, Scotland successfully cloned a sheep named Dolly. Following steps were involved in cloning : 1. A cell was collected from the mammary gland of a female Finn Dorset sheep. 2. An egg was obtained from a Scottish black face ewe and its nucleus was removed. 3. The nucleus from the mammary gland cell of Dorset sheep was introduced in the egg. 4. This egg was then implanted in the uterus."
