0,Q. 1. Discuss all the chemical properties of  metal and  non-metals.,"Ans..  Chemical Properties of Metals :  Metals react with oxygen to produce oxides which are alkaline in nature. e.g.,  Magnesium +  Oxygen   Magnesium oxide.  Metallic oxides produce bases by reacting with water differently. Na2O + H2O  2NaOH  (Sodium oxide) hydroxide) Metals react with acid to produce hydrogen gas. 2HCl + 2Na  2NaCl + H2  (Sodium (Hydrogen chloride) gas) chloride)   More reactive metals displace the less reactive metals from their compounds in an aqueous solution. Zn CuSO4    ZnSO4 Cu    Chemical Properties of Non-metals  Non-metals react with oxygen to produce oxides which are acidic in nature. S + O2  SO2 SO2 + H2O  H2SO3  Non-metals do not react with water.  Non-metals do not show displacement reactions."
