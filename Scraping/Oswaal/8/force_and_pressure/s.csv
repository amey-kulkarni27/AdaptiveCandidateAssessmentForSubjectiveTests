What is the state of motion ? How does it changes the state of an object ?,"The state of motion of an object is described by its speed and the direction of motion. An object may be at rest or in motion, both are its state of motion. It can be changed by acting of force on that object."
Enlist the types of contact forces.,Contact forces can be of two types :  Muscular forces.  Force of friction.
A ball rolling along the ground gradually slows down and finally comes to rest ? Why does this happen ? What is the effect of this force ?,The force responsible for changing the state of motion of ball is the force of friction. The ball will come to rest position. This force causes wear and tear of the objects in motion.
Enlist the types of non-contact forces.,Non-contact forces :  Gravitational force  Magnetic force  Electrostatic force
Define frictional force.,The force responsible for wearing out tyres of motor vehicle is force of friction.
Why cutting vegetables with a blunt knife is not easier ?,"Because of the larger area, smaller the pressure means blunt knife have large area instead of sharp knife. So less pressure will be on vegetable which makes it tough to cut. 2"
Why is it easy to fix the pointed nail into wooden plank ?,"Because the area of the pointed end of the nail is much smaller than that of its head. The same force, therefore, produces a pressure sufficient to push the pointed end of the nail into the wooden plank."
How can you can prove that pressure is exerted by liquids ?,Take a transparent glass tube. The length of tube should be about 15 cm. Take a thin sheet of a good rubber. Stretch the rubber and fix tightly over one end of the pipe. Hold the tube in vertical position. Pour water in it. The rubber sheet bulges out. This bulging is due to the pressure exerted by water. Hence it is proved.
Give two examples of situations in which applied force causes a change in the shape of an object. , We press a balloon to change its shape.  We make chapati from a ball of dough.
Give two examples of each situation in which you push or pull to change the state of motion of an object. , We push the door to open it.  We pull the drawer to open it. 
Name the forces acting on a plastic bucket containing water held above the ground level in your hand. Discuss why the forces acting on the bucket do not bring a change in its state of motion. ,Muscular force and gravitation forces are acting on the plastic bucket. The force does not bring the change in its state of motion because they are acting in opposite direction with equal magnitudes. The effect of the gravitational force will pull it down if the muscular force grows weak. The body will feel the stretch of gravitational force and will have to bend to cancel the magnitude of gravitational force.
Describe each effect of the force given below with one example.  Make an object move from rest.  May change the speed of an object.  May bring about a change in the shape of an object.,Effect of the force on following situations :  A child is standing on his bicycle. He exerts force on pedal which moves the cycle on the road. It indicates that an object can move from rest with effect of force.  A car is moving on the road in a slow speed. Applying force on the accelerator will increase the speed of the car.  Take lump of dough in a plate. Make chapatis from that dough by rolling rollar and putting pressure on it. It changes the shape by force.
What is atmospheric pressure ? How can we get an idea about the magnitude of atmospheric pressure ?,"The envelop of air surrounding the earth is known as the atmosphere. The pressure exerted by this air is known as atmospheric pressure. The magnitude of atmospheric pressure can be felt by following experiment. Take a good quality rubber sucker. Press it hard on a smooth plane surface. When we press the sucker, most of the air between its cup and surface escapes out. The sucker sticks to the surface because the pressure of atmosphere acts on it. To pull the sucker off the surface, the applied force should be large. This activity might give you an idea about the magnitude of atmospheric pressure. 3"
