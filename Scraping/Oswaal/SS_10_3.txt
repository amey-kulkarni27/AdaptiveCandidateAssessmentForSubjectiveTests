PREFACE
CBSE always believes in Global Trends of Educational Transformation and Continual Improvement
Process which means that the Board continually examines its processes and curriculum to evolve and find
resonance amongst the educational fraternity. In this context, CBSE has yet proposed a remodeled
assessment structure on 31st January 2017 notifying the restoration of Class X Board examination,
thereby eliminating the semester system of evaluation (popularly called CCE) applicable from the
academic year 2017-18 onwards.
We at Oswaal Books are always proactive to follow the changes proposed by the Board and implement
the same as soon as possible to put the students, parents and teachers at ease. The Oswaal Question
Banks have been modified and rewritten as per the latest Board guidelines in order to supplement the
need of the students during
duri ng the entire academic year.
As the CBSE remodeled assessment structure is divided in two major parts namely Internal
Assessment and Board Examinations,
Examinations , Oswaal Question Banks have been designed to assist students to
prepare for their periodic tests, internal assignments as well as the Board examinations with equal ease.
Oswaal Question Banks will not only help students with regular studies but will also equip the teachers
with the most updated study material for the class.
The Question Banks have been designed with a lot of care and attention to details. All chapters are
arranged 'TOPICWISE' where each topic is explained in detail and covers all typologies of Questions
specified by CBSE, with well labelled diagrams and high quality figures/diagrams for fast learning.
Answers from CBSE Marking scheme are highlighted in order to specify the correct method of answering
questions for attaining maximum marks. We hope to make Oswaal Question Banks a student's best
companion to sail through the entire academic year smo othly.
Last but not the least, we would like to offer heartfelt gratitude to our authors , editors, reviewers and
specially students who regularly send us suggestions which helps in continuous improvement of this
book and makes it stand
stand out as “One of the Best” in its category.
We, at Oswaal Books, wish you all a very Happy Learning and a successful 2017-18!!

Why Topic Wise Question Banks Are A Better Choice than Previous Year’s Papers ?

Question Banks

Previous Years’ Papers

1. Chapter-wise and Topic–wise presentation
in Question Banks facilitates systematic
study.

1. Year Wise
Wise presentation restricts methodical
flow of learning.

2. Question Banks can be referred to by the
students throughout the year as well as at
the completion of each chapter in school.

2. These can be referred to only after the
completion of the full syllabus in school.

3. Question Banks, take into account any
changes in syllabus or layout and hence
are fully updated and aligned as per the
latest specifications by the Board .

3. Previous Years' questions cannot be
changed and hence fail to be adept with the
latest Board specificatio
specifications

system of Vietnam to consolidate its control.

to provide natural resources and other goods.
The Vietnamese economy was based on rice
cultivation and rubber plantation to meet the
French needs. Labours were hired on contracts,
gradually landlordism became well entrenched
and standard of living declined. To suit the
French requirements, for easy transportation
of goods, massive infrastructure projects, rail
networks were established.
(ii) Religion : The French, in order to consolidate
its control and authority, wanted to exercise
cultural and social domination and influence.
One such way was to introduce Christianity in
Vietnam, establish Christian Missionaries and
encourage conversions.
(iii) Education : The French, in order to civilize
the natives, introduced modern education
and dismantled the traditional education
system in Vietnam. They followed the policy
of discrimination against the Vietnamese
students, of deliberately failing students. The
education system glorified French
French rule.

modern Vietnam with modern architecture
and engineering skills to build a modern city in
Hanoi but the native quarter was not provided

colony and to halt British desire to expand
southwards from China. France prevented
Vietnamese from qualifying for white collar

also keep buyers and sellers informed about
their present and prospective markets.
(iv) Goods and services cannot move on their own
from supply houses to demand locales. This
necessitates the need for transportation. Thus,
a country's economy depends not only on the
production and sale of goods and services, but
on their transport as well.

Money is called a medium of exchange because it
serves as a common mode through which people
can buy what they want and sell what they have.
The use of money removes the barter system and
thus ended the concept of double coincidence of
wants. Money makes it easier to carry out trading
activities. It acts as an intermediate in the exchange
process and facilitates the buying and selling of
things. A person having money can buy anything
that he/she wants, unlike in the barter system.

exchange for money and can buy other things with
that money. In simpler terms, money has made the

At world level the origin of consumer movement
was in the form of consumer cooperatives. The first
cooperative came in 1904 in Madras but there was
not much development till 1962. The objectives of

(ii) Adulteration and black marketing.
(iii) Range of product is less due to lack of
technology advancement.

The Hoa Hao movement was found by a man called
Huynh Phu So in 1939. It gained great popularity in
the fertile Mekong Delta area. It drew on religious
ideas popular in anti - French uprisings of the
nineteenth century. Huynh Phu So's criticism
against useless expenditure has a wide appeal. He
also opposed the sale of child brides, gambling
and the use of alcohol. French put him in mental
asylum. Interestingly, the doctor who had to prove
him insane became his follower in 1941. Even the
French doctors declared that he was insane. The
French authorities exiled

Under the Inland Emigration Act of 1859, plantation
workers were not permitted to leave the tea
gardens without permission, and in fact they were
rarely given such permission. When they heard
of the Non-Cooperation Movement, thousands of
workers defied the authorities, left the plantations
and headed home. They believed that Gandhi Raj
was coming and everyone would be given land in
their own villages. They, however, never reached
their destination. Stranded on the way by a railway
and steamer strike, they were caught by the police
and brutally beaten up.

such as :
(i) Railways carry out businesses and various
multifarious activities such as pilgrimage
tourism, travel, commuting etc.
(ii) They help in the transportation of raw materials
from the source to the industries, and the
manufactured goods to the market. Thus, they
efficiently help in the linking of the industries
with the market and develop them.
(iii) Furthermore, they also help in the
transportation of crops, dairy and its products,
vegetables, fruits, flowers, and various allied
agricultural products to the markets and thus
help the farmers to earn a good profit.
Hence, the given statement is clearly justified, as
railways are the principle means of transport in

Giuseppe Garibaldi played an important role in the unification of Italy. He joined the war along with his armed
volunteers called the ‘Red Shirts’. In 1860, Garibaldi and his troops marched into Southern Italy and the Kingdom
of Two Sicilies. In 1861, Victor Emmanuel II was announced King of United Italy. In 1867, Garibaldi and his
volunteers attacked the French troops stationed in the Papal states.
Britain has a different history of how it consolidated as a nation—state without uprisings and revolutions. The
British Isles was inhabited by ethnic English, Welsh, Scot or Irish. The English nation grew more in power and
wealth, and it began to exert influence over the other nations of the islands.
The concept of nation states, with England as the centre, came in 1688 after the
the Parliament snatched power from
the monarchy. In 1707, the Act of Union between England and Scotland resulted in the formation of the ‘United
Kingdom of Great Britain’.
To ensure the growth of British identity
id entity,, Scotland’s cultural and political institutions were suppressed. The British
imposed control over Ireland as well. Ireland was deeply divided into two groups, Catholics and Protestants. The
English favoured the protestants, and helped them establish their dominance over a largely Catholic Ireland.
In 1801, Ireland was forcibly incorporated into the United Kingdom after a failed Irish revolt. The symbols of new
Britain were the English language, the British Flag (Union Jack), and the British national anthem (God save our
Novel King).

Visualising the Nation :
A symbol is a visual image that represents something other than itself. It may be a representation using an

object, picture, written word, sound or a particular mark.
During the 18th and the 19th centuries, several symbols were used by artists and revolutionaries to depict

abstract concepts. These symbols were usually popular images from everyday life that uneducated masses
could easily identify with.
During revolutions, artists represented a nation as a person. This personification gave life to an abstract
concept like nation.
The way of expressing an abstract idea like freedom or liberty through a symbol that may be person or thing

is known as Allegory. An allegory has a literal and a symbolic meaning. In the nineteenth century, French
artists used the female allegory to represent France. She was Christened Marianne. She symbolises reason,
liberty and the ideals of the republic.
In Germany, the allegory for the nation was again a female figure called Germania. A broken chain represented

Marianne’s fasces or a bundle of rods with an axe in the middle was used to symbolise strength in unity. The

red Phrygian cap signified freedom of a slave. It was also known as the liberty cap. French people wore these
caps a few days before the storming of the Bastille.

Nationalism and Imperialism :
Through the 18th and the mid19th century, Europe was marked by a lot of chaos and turmoil. After 1871, there

was a significant change in the concept of nationalism in Europe.
Nationalist groups in Europe had become increasingly incompatible with each other and were constantly in

conflict. The major European powers, namely Russia, Germany,
Germany, England and Austro-Hungary began taking
advantage of nationalism in Europe, to materialise their aims for imperialism.
The European powers sighted the much-disturbed Balkan region to fulfil their imperialist goals. The Balkan

Civilising Mission in Vietnam – Education (Phase 1)

The French
French Colonialists believed in carrying out a ‘civilising mission’ under the guise of modernising the
colony and they used education as tool to do so. This led to an erosion of cultural beliefs, religion and
tradition of Vietnam.

The French citizens living in Vietnam
Vietnam called Colons felt that educated Vietnamese
Vietnamese could replace them as
teachers, shopkeepers and policemen. The elite Vietnamese were very influenced by the Chinese culture.
The traditional education system of Vietnam was dismantled and a new French education system was
introduced.

The school textbooks glorified and justified the French
French colonial rule and portrayed
portrayed Vietnamese
Vietnamese people as
primitive, and incapable of intellectual work. The Tonkin
Tonkin Free School, started in 1907 was to provide western
education and ideas. The do mination of French culture faced opposition and resistance in Vietnam.

As the number of Vietnamese
Vietnamese teachers in lower classes
classes increased, they began to question the text books. In
1926, a major protest took place in the Saigon Native Girls school.

Students came in conflict with the French as
as well as the elite. By the 1920’s students formed various political
parties such as the Party of Young Annan and published nationalist journals like the Annanese Student
opposing the French domination.
Health and Hygiene - Colony Versus Empire (Phase 2)

The rat hunt and
and bubonic plague of 1903
1903 was a clear indication of the failure in the French
French civilising mission.
It also presented a unique way for the Vietnamese to counter colonialism in day–to–day life. Bubonic plague
is a contagious disease, which often proves fatal and can also cause an epidemic.

In 1903, the bubonic plague broke out in Hanoi and people manipulated the situation in a different way to
exploit French colonisers.
Modernising Hanoi, one of the main cities of Vietnam came first on their agenda. The French part of Hanoi
was beautified with wide avenues and a well laid out sewer system. The native quarter was completely
ignored with no modern hygienic facilities.

Vietnam with modern native quarter that was not

collective bargaining.

beliefs were a mixture of Buddhism,
Buddhi sm, Confucianism
and syncretic tradition. French introduced
Christianity against their interest which resulted

the ‘West’ as the symbol of development and
civilisation. This led to debates in Vietnam between
Phan Cheu Frinh and Phan Boi Chau who earlier
opposed the idea of resisting the French and was
hostile to French, whereas the later one resisted
French and wanted to regain sovereignty and ties

Effects of
o f First World War
War : The War led to a huge increase in defence
expenditure. This was financed by war loans and by increasing taxes.
Custom duties were raised and income tax was introduced to raise
extra revenue. Prices of items increased during the war years. The
prices doubled between 1913 and 1918. The common people were
the worst sufferers because of price rise. Forced recruitment of rural
people in the army was another cause of widespread anger among
people.
Crop failure in many parts of India resulted in acute shortage of foods.
Influenza epidemic further aggravated the problem. According to

The Rowlatt Act(1919):
The Rowlatt Act was passed by the Imperial
Imperial Legislative Council in 1919. The Indian members did not support
the Act, but it was passed; nevertheless. The Act gave enormous powers to the government to repress political
activities. It allowed detention of political prisoners without trial for two years.
On 6th April, 1919; Gandhiji launched a nationwide Satyagraha against the proposed Rowlatt Act. The call of strike
on 6th April got huge response. People came out in support in various cities, shops were shut down and workers
in railway workshops went on strike. The British administration decided to clamp down on the nationalists.
Several local leaders were arrested. Mahatma Gandhi was barred from entering Delhi.
Jallianwalla Bagh :
On 10th April 1919; in Amritsar; the police fired upon a peaceful procession. This provoked widespread attacks
on government establishments. Martial law was imposed in Amritsar and the command of the area was given to
General Dyer.
The infamous Jallianwalla Bagh
Bagh Massacre took place on 13th April; the day on which Baisakhi is celebrated in
Punjab. A crowd of villagers came to participate in a fair in Jallianwalla Bagh. This was enclosed from all sides
with narrow entry points. General Dyer blocked the exit points and opened fire on the crowd. Hundreds of
people were killed in the incident. Public reaction to the incident took a violent turn in many north Indian towns.
The government was quite brutal in its response. Things took highly violent turn. Mahatma Gandhi called off the
movement as he did not want violence to continue.
Khilafat Movement :
The Khilafat issue gave Mahatma
Mahatma Gandhi an opportunity to bring the Hindus and Muslims on a common
platform. The Ottoman Turkey was badly defeated in the First World War. There were rumours about a harsh
peace treaty likely to be imposed on the Ottoman emperor; who was the spiritual head of the Islamic world (the
Khalifa). A Khilafat committee was formed in Bombay in March 1919 to defend the Khalifa. This committee had
leaders like the brothers Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali. They also wanted Mahatma Gandhi to take up the
cause to build a united mass action. At the Calcutta session of the Congress in September 1920, the resolution was
passed to launch a Non-Cooperation movement in support of Khilafat and also for swaraj.
Non-Cooperation Movement :
In his famous book Hind Swaraj (1909),
(1909), Mahatma Gandhi declared
declared that British rule was established
established in India with
the cooperation of Indians, and had survived only because of this cooperation. If Indians refused to cooperate,
British rule in India would collapse within a year,
year, and swaraj would come.
com e. Gandhiji believed that if Indians begin
to refuse to cooperate, the British rulers will have no other way than to leave India.
Some of the proposals of Non- Cooperation Movement :
(i) Surrender the titles which were awarded
awarded by the British government.
(ii) Boycott of civil services, army,
army, police, courts, legislative councils and schools.
(iii) Boycott of foreign goods.
(iv) Launch full civil disobedience campaign, if the government persisted with repressive measures.
Differing Strands within the Movement : The Non-Cooperation-Khilafat Movement began in January 1921.
Various social groups participated in this movement, each with its own specific aspiration. All of them responded
to the call of Swaraj, but the term meant different things to different people.
Awadh
The peasants’ movement in Awadh
Awadh was led by Baba Ramchandra. He was a sanyasi who had earlier
earlier worked
in Fiji as an indentured labourer. The peasants were against the high rents and may other cess which were
demanded by talukdars and landlords. The peasants demanded reduction of revenue, abolition of begar, and
social boycott of oppressive landlords.
Tribal Peasants :
Tribal peasants gave their own interpretation of Mahatma Gandhi and the idea o f swaraj. The tribals were
prevented from entering the forests to graze cattle, or to collect fruits and firewoOutside Delhi. The new forest
laws were a threat to their livelihoOutside Delhi. The government forced them to do begar on road construction.
Many rebels from the tribal areas became non-violent and often carried guerilla
guerilla warfare against the British
officials.
Swaraj in the Plantations
The plantation workers were not permitted to leave the tea gardens without permission; as per the Indian
Emigration Act of 1859. When the news of Non-Cooperation Movement spread to the plantations, many workers
began to defy the authorities. They left plantations and headed towards their homes. But they got stranded on
the way because of a railway and steamer strike. They were caught by the police and brutally beaten up.

landlord to be remitted. They often joined the radical movements which were led by Socialists and Communists.
Congress did not want to alienate the rich landlords and hence, the relationship between the poor peasants and
Congress was uncertain.
Businessmen
The Indian merchants and industrialists could grow their business during the First World War
ar.. They were against
those colonial policies which restricted their business activities. They wanted protection against imports and a
rupee-sterling foreign exchange ratio which would discourage imports. The Indian Industrial and Commercial
Congress was formed in 1920 and the Federation of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FICCI) was
formed in 1927. These were the results of attempts to bring the co mmon business interests on a common platform.
For the businessmen, Swaraj meant an end to oppressive colonial policies. They wanted an environment which
could allow the business to flourish. They were apprehensive of militant activities and of growing influence of
socialism among the younger members of the Congress.
Industrial Workers
The industrial workers showed lukewarm response to the Civil Disobedience Movement. Since industrialists were
closer to the Congress, workers kept a distance from the movement. But some workers selectively participated
in the Movement. Congress did not want to alienate the industrialists and hence preferred to keep the workers’
demands at bay

World War.

Ans. The two lessons learnt by the economists and
politicians during the Second World War were :
First : An industrial society based on mass
production needs mass consumption. For mass
consumption, steady income was necessary and
for stable income, full employment was necessary.
For this, the government has to take step to
minimise the fluctuation of price, production and
employment. Hence, economic stability could
be ensured by the government intervention.
Second : The goal of full employment could be
achieved only if the government controls the flow

Ans. On earning the power, the British East India
Company asserted a monopoly right to trade.
It developed a system that would eliminate
competition, control cost and ensure regular
supply of cotton and silk goods. These measures
ultimately led to the ruining of Indian weavers.
The measures adopted were as follows :

(i) The company tried to eliminate the existing
traders and brokers connected with cloth trade
and establish a direct control over the weavers.
It appointed a paid servant called Gomastha
to supervise the weavers, collect supplies and
examine the quality of cloth.

(ii) The company weavers were prevented from
selling to other buyers. The weavers were tied
to the company by a system of advances. Loans
were given to the weavers for production and
they had to handover the finished products to the
Gomasthas.
(iii) The price that the weavers received was low,
but they were left with no choice
choic e but to sell their
goods to the British because the loans tied them to
the British.
This was a situation of helplessness and
desperation that made them to revolt against the
British. They quit their profession and migrated
to other places. (CBSE Marking Scheme, 2012) 5

their overseas market.
(iii) Eventually, the Manchester goods started

difficult for the Indian weavers to compete with
the low cost Manchester cloth.
(iv) The British Government

industrialization as proto-industrialization.
This proto-industrial system

In order to eliminate the existing traders and brokers connected with the cloth trade, to develop a system
of management and control that would eliminate competition, control costs, and ensure regular supplies of
cotton and silk goods, the East India Company took two steps–
(i) They Appointed a paid servant called the gomastha to supervise weavers, collect supplies, and examine
the quality of cloth.
(ii) It prevented Company weavers from dealing with other buyers by making it compulsory for those who
took loans that they had to handover the cloth they produced to the g omastha.
Due to the development of cotton industries in England, the industrial groups worried about the imports from
the other countries and thus pressurised the go vernment to impose import duties on cotton textiles.
The industrialists also persuaded the East India Company to sell British manufactures in Indian markets

THE AGE OF INDUSTRIALIZATION

Q. 9. “Getting a job in factories was always difficult
in the 19th century.” Justify the statement
comparing the case of England and India.
[Board Term-I, (34), 2012]


Ans. (i) England : The actual possibility of getting a job
depended on existing network of friendship and
kin relationship. A person was more likely to get
a job if he had a friend or a relative working in the
factory. Many who did not have connections had
to wait for weeks spending nights under bridges
or in the night shelters.
(ii) India : In India, the number of job seekers was
always more than the jobs available. Industrialists
usually employed jobbers, who usually were old
and trusted workers to get new recruits.
The jobber got people from his village, ensured
them job and helped them settle in the city.
Jobbers eventually began demanding money for
the favours they showed and controlled the lives

[NCERT]
Explain.
OR


Why could mechanical technology not replace
human labour in Victorian Britain ? Explain.
[Board Term-I, DDE-Set M, 2015]

[ 89
Ans.(i)
(i) In Victorian Britain, there was no shortage of
human labour, so industrialists had no problem of
labour shortage or high wage costs. They did not
want to introduce machines that got rid of human
labour and required large capital investment.
(ii) In many industries the demand for labour was
seasonal. Gas works and breweries were especially
busy through the cold months. So they needed
more workers to meet their peak demand. Book
binders and printers, catering to X-mas demand,
too needed extra hands before December.
(iii) A range of products could be produced only with
hand labour. Machines were oriented to produce
uniform standardised goods for a mass market. But
the demand in the market was often for goods with
intricate designs and specific shapes.
(iv) The aristocrats and bourgeoisie preferred things
produced by hand in Victorian Britain. Hand-made
products came to symbolise refinement and class.
(v) Hand-made products were better finished,
individually produced and carefully designed.

Resources are compulsory for human survival as well as for maintaining the quality of life.
Human beings use resources indiscriminately and this has led to global ecological crises such as global
warming, ozone layer depletion, environmental pollution and land degradation.
Development of Resources : Resources are vital for human survival. It was believed that resources are free
gifts of nature. As a result, man used them indiscriminately which led to the following problems :
(i) Depletion of resources.
(ii) Accumulation of resources in a few hands.
(iii) Indiscriminate exploitation of resources.
 For a sustained quality of life and global peace, it is essential that resources should be distributed
equally.
 Sustainable economic development means development should take place without damaging the
environment and development in the present should not compromise with the needs of the future
generation.
Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, 1992
In June 1992, for achieving sustainable development in the 21st century, more than 100 states participated
in the First International Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. The main focus of this summit was to
protect environment and socio economic development at the global level. The leaders of the states signed the
Declaration on Global Climate Change and Biolo gical Diversity.
Diversity.
Agenda 21 : It has been signed by world leaders at the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development (UNCED). The aim of this agenda is to achieve global sustainable development by combating
environmental damage, poverty and disease through global co- operation on common interests, mutual needs
and shared responsibilities. The major objective of this agenda is that every local government has the power
to draw its own local Agenda 21.

Resource-Planning in India
Resource planning involves the following steps :
(i) Identification and inventory of resources, which involves surveying, mapping and quantitative as well as
qualitative estimation and measurement of resources.
(ii) For implementing resource development plans, evolve a planning structure with appropriate technology
technology,,
skill and institutional set up.
(iii) Match resource development plan with overall national development plans.
India has 43% plain land, 30% mountain region, 27% pleateau region.
Land resources are used for the following purpose :
(i) Forests

Resources : All the useful elements of environment that satisfy our basic needs are called resources.
Biotic resources : These are obtained from biosphere and have life such as human beings, flora and fauna,
fisheries, livestock, etc.
Abiotic resources : Resources that comprise of non-living things, such as rocks, minerals, etc.
Renewable resources : The resources which can be used again and again and can be reproduced by physical,
chemical or mechanical processes are known as renewable or replenishable resources. For example : solar and
wind energy.
Non-renewable resources : These are the resources that once used, can’t be reproduced or replenished. For
example : fossil fuels, minerals like copper and iron ore.
Natural resources : Natural endowments in the form of land, water, vegetation and minerals are called natural
resources. These are free gifts of nature.
Man-made resources : These are the resources that are created by human beings with the help of machines.

beings do not have the appropriate technology to access these materials.
Reserves : They are the subsets of the stock which can be put into use with the help of existing technology but
their use has not been started yet.
Sustainable development : It means development should take place without damaging the environment and
development in the present should not compromise with needs of the future generations.
Resource planning : It is the widely accepted strategy for judicious use of resources.
Resource conservation : Conservation of resources means the judicial and planned use of resources. Thus, we
get benefitted from them for long time.
Gross cropped area : Area sown more than once in an agricultural year plus net sown area is known as gross
cropped area.
Fallow land : A land which is left without cultivation for one or less than one agricultural year for increasing
its fertility is known as the fallow land.

Soil erosion : The removal of top fertile soil cover due to various reasons such as wind, glacier and water is
called soil erosion.
Gullies : The running water cuts through the clayey soil and makes deep channels known as gullies.
Sheet erosion : When the top soil is washed away due to heavy flow of water down the slopes, it is known as
sheet erosion.
Wind erosion : When the top fertile soil blows off due to wind, it is known as wind erosion.
Strip cropping : Large fields can be divided into strips. Strips of grass are left to grow between the crops. This
breaks up the force of the wind. This method is known as strip cropping.
Contour ploughing : Ploughing along the contour lines can slow down the flow of water down the slopes.
This is called contour ploughing.
Shelter belts : Planting lines of trees to create shelter breaks up the force of the wind. Rows of such trees are
called shelter belts.

(ii) Over-exploitation, excessive use and unequal
access to water among different social groups.

(iii)

Water scarcity may be an outcome of large and
growing population and consequent greater
demands for water. A large population means
more water to produce more food. Hence, to
facilitate higher food-grain production, water
resources are being over exploited to expand
irrigated areas for dry-season agriculture.
(iv) Most farmers have their own wells and
tubewells in their farms for irrigation to increase
their production. But it may lead to falling
groundwater levels, adversely affecting water
availability and food security of the people. Thus,
inspite of abundant water there is water scarcity.

regions, some agricultural fields were converted
into rain fed storage structures. These structures
are found in Rajasthan.
(v) Tankas : The tankas were built inside the main
house or the courtyard. They were connected to
the sloping roofs of the houses through a pipe.
Rain falling on the rooftops would travel down
the pipe and was stored in these underground

of land with the help of primitive tools like hoe, dao and
digging sticks. It depends upon monsoon, natural fertility of
the soil and suitability of other environmental conditions to the
crops grown.
(ii) Intensive subsistence farming : This type of farming is practised in areas of high population pressure on land.
It is done where high doses of biochemical inputs and irrigation are used for obtaining higher production.
(iii) Commercial farming : The main characteristic of this type of farming is the use of higher doses of modern
inputs e.g., high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, chemical fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides in order to
obtain higher productivity
pr oductivity..
India has three Cropping Seasons Rabi, Kharif and Zaid.
Rabi crops are sown in winter from October to December and harvested in summer from April to June.
Kharif crops are grown with the onset of monsoon in different parts of the country and these are harvested in
September to October
October..
Between the Rabi and the Kharif seasons, there is a short season during
d uring the summer, known as the Zaid season.
Major crops grown in India are rice, wheat, millets, pulses, tea, coffee, sugarcane, oilseeds, cotton, and jute.
Jowar,, bajra
Jowar

have very high nutritional value. For example, ragi is very rich in iron, calcium, other micro nutrients and roughage.
India is the largest producer as well as the consumer of pulses in the world. These are the major source of protein
in a vegetarian diet.
Major pulses that are grown in India are tur (arhar), urad, moong, masur, peas and gram.
India is the largest producer of oilseeds in the world. Main oil-seeds produced in India are groundnut, mustard,
coconut, sesamum (til), soyabean, castor seeds, cotton seeds, linseed and sunflower. Most of these are edible and
used as cooking mediums.
Horticulture crops : India is the largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the world. India is a producer of
tropical as well as temperate fruits.
India produces about 13 percent of the world’s vegetables. It is an important producer of pea, cauliflower, onion,
cabbage, tomato, brinjal and potato.
The non-food crops grown in India are rubber, fibre crops, cotton, jute, etc.

India’s food security policy has a primary objective to ensure availability of food grains to the common people at
an affordable price. It has enabled the poo r to have access to the food.
The Green Revolution promised improvement in the condition of marginal and small farm ers.
In the 1980s and 1990s, a comprehensive land development programme was initiated, which included both
institutional and technical reforms.
Provision for crop insurance against drought, flood,cyclone, fire and disease, establishment of Grameen banks,
cooperative societies and banks for providing loan facilities to the farmers at lower rates of interest were some
important steps in this direction.
Kissan Credit Card (KCC), Personal Accident Insurance Scheme (PAIS) are some other schemes introduced by the
Government of India for the benefit of the farmers.
The Government of India made concerted efforts to modernise agriculture by establishing the Indian Council
of Agricultural Research (ICAR), agricultural universities, veterinary services and animal breeding centres,
horticulture development, research and development in the field of m eteorology and weather forecast, etc.
Today
oday,, Indian farmers are facing a big challenge from international competition.
The growth rate in agriculture is decelerating which is an alarming situation.
Subsidy on fertilisers is decreased leading to inc rease in the cost of production.
Reduction in import duties on agricultural products has proved detrimental to agriculture in the country
country..
Farmers are withdrawing their investment from agriculture causing a downfall in the employment in agriculture.
In order to ensure availability of food to all sections of society our government carefully designed a national food
security system. It consists of two compo nents—(a)buffer stock and (b) public distribution system (PDS).
The FCI procures food grains from the farmers at the government announced minim um support price (MSP).
The high MSP,
MSP, subsidies in input and committed FCI purchases have distorted the cropping pattern. Wheat and
paddy crops are being grown more for the MSP they get. Punjab and Haryana are foremost examples. This has also
created a serious imbalance in inter-crop parities.
There has been a gradual shift from cultivation of food crops to cultivation of fruits, vegetables, oil-seeds and
industrial crops.
Globalisations has exposed the Indian farmers to new challenges.
Genetic engineering is recognized as a powerful supplement in inventing new hybrid varieties of seeds.
Today organic farming is much in vogue because it is practiced without factory made chemicals such as fertilisers
and pesticides.
Indian farmers should diversify their cropping pattern from cereals to high-value crops. This will increase incomes
and reduce environmental degradation simultaneously.

Mineral : A naturally occurring substance that has a definite chemical composition is a mineral.
Metallic Minerals : The metallic minerals contain metal in raw form. Metals are hard substances that conduct
heat and electricity and have a characteristic lustre or shine. Iron ore, bauxite, manganese ore are some examples.
Non- Metallic
Metallic Minerals : The non-metallic minerals do not contain metals. Limestone, mica and gypsum are
examples of such minerals. The mineral fuels like coal and petroleum are also non-metallic minerals.
Rock : A rock is an aggregate
ag gregate of one or more minerals but without definite c omposition of constituent of mineral.
Ores : Rocks from which minerals are mined are known as ores. Although more than 2,800 types of minerals have
been identified, only about 100 are considered ore minerals.
Mining : The process of taking out minerals from rocks buried under the earth’s surface is called mining.
Open Cast Mining : Minerals that lie at shallow depths are taken out by removing the surface layer; this is known
as open cast mining.
Shaft mining : Deep bores, called shafts, have to be made to reach mineral deposits that lie at great depths. This
is called shaft mining.
Drilling : Petroleum and natural gas occur far below the earth’s surface. Deep wells are bored to take them out,
this is called drilling.
Quarrying : Minerals that lie near the surface are simply dug out, by the process known as quarrying.

TOPIC-2
Conservation of Minerals in India
Quick Review
All types of minerals are exhaustible resources. Other serious problems associated with minerals are production
and accumulation of wastes at various stages of mining, processing as well as use.
(i) Efficiency in Mining : Present technologies are inadequate in terms of their efficiency. The world has yet to
evolve a really efficient technology suited to present day environment called the technology of beneficiation.
e.g. A lot of feed stock went waste during petroleum refining; today these wastes are utilized to make many
by-products.
(ii) Substitutes : Scarce minerals can be substituted by developing biodegradable alternatives. e.g. Copper was
earlier used extensively in electrical industries. But now besides aluminium, many other materials are used
to conserve precious copper.

[ 169

MINERALS AND ENERGY RESOURCES

(iii) Recycling : Mini steel plants are using scrap iron all over the world, which is the best examples of recycling.
It helps reduce wastes, but efficient recycling technologies have yet to be developed. Recycling is very
expensive. Problems also arise on account of mixing together of various types of minerals, otherwise products
made from iron, copper, lead, zinc and almost all types of minerals can be recycled for more.
(iv) Minimised Exports : Exports should be minimised and value added manufactured products should be
exported.
Most dynamic elements in mineral are conservation is however

Assessing the future demand for resources, proper planning is also a conservative technique. It also includes

natural gas, nuclear materials, falling water, sun, wind, etc. Wind, sunrays and falling water are converted into
electricity while others like coal, petroleum and natural g as- are applied directly in motor vehicles and machines.
Fossil fuels require combustion, they produce many gases and wastes causing damage to the environment. 2/5th
of the global energy consumption comes from burning oil and the rest from burning coal and natural gas.



Electricity : Electricity is obtained in three ways which are termed as hydro-electricity, thermal electricity and
nuclear electricity
electricity..



Coal : Coal is the prime source of energy, often called the “Mother of Industries” or “Black Gold”. It was the basis
of industrial revolution. It is used as a raw material in the iron and steel and chemical industries. It is the main fuel
for producing thermal power. India ranks 7th in the world for coal
c oal reserves.



Four types of coal :
(i) Anthracite : Contains 80% carbon, hard, black and compact, found only in Jammu and Kashmir. It is the
highest quality hard coal.
(ii) Bituminous : 60-80% carbon, widely used.
(iii) Lignite : 60% of carbon, low grade. It is called “brown coal”.
(iv) Peat : <50% carbon and burns like wood.



Petroleum :
Liquid fossil fuel, wells are dug or drilled on land
land or offshore to bring oil to the surface. This crude oil is transported
to refineries where it is changed into g asoline and petrochemicals. Petroleum refineries serve as ‘nodal industries’
for chemical, fertilizer and synthetic textile industries as various products are obtained during refining petroleum.
It provides fuel for heating, lighting, running machineries, vehicles, lubricants and raw materials for some
manufacturing plastics, chemicals, etc.



Natural Gas : A clean energy resource associated with petroleum. Can be extracted easily by drilling wells. Does
not require processing, does not emit CO2 and burns hotter and clearer, is cheaper and can be used to generate
electricity, but it is limited. Used as a source of energy as well as an industrial raw material in the petrochemical
industry.

The key factor influencing all decisions about setting
setting up a manufacturing
industry, including its location, is the low cost. The main costs in a
manufacturing industry are for procuring raw material, producing goods and distributing finished goods in the
market.



The ideal location for a factory will be a place that has easy and low-cost availability of raw material, capital, land,
labour, power, transport, and market.



A manufacturing industry promotes the urbanisation of its neighbourhood. Already urbanised areas also
attract industries, since they provide ready facilities for transport, banking, labour, consultancy, etc. If an urban
centre offers sufficient facilities and advantages, several industries come up there together to form an industrial
agglomeration. These industries together form an agglomeration economy.



Before independence, most industries in India were located in port cities to enable easy overseas trade.
Manufacturing industries are classified based on their source of raw material, role, capital investment, ownership
pattern, and bulk of supplies like raw material and finished products.

Manufacturing industries that use minerals as raw material are called mineral-based industries. The iron and steel
industry is the basic industry on which all other industries depend. The producton and per capita consumption
of steel is a measure of a country’s economic development.
The main raw materials used
used in the iron and steel industry are iron ore, coal and limestone. The raw materials and
finished products of iron and steel industries are quite bulky, these industries must be located near the mining
areas of the required minerals and must be conn ected by a good transport network.
India is the ninth largest producer of crude steel and the largest producer of sponge iron in the world. India is also
a leading exporter of steel in the world.
The per capita consumption of steel in India is only 32 kilograms. There are 10 primary integrated
integrated steel plants in
India. These integrated plants handle all stages of steel production, from procurement of basic raw material to
producing finished rolled and shaped steel. India has many mini steel plants that produce customised alloy steel
using scrap iron or sponge iron as raw material.
China has become the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel, leaving India far behind. Most
steel manufacturing industries are located in the Chota Nagpur Plateau region because of the availability of
inexpensive, high-grade raw material and abundant cheap labour. The main challenges faced by the industry in
realising its full potential are limited supply of expensive coking coal, erratic power supply, low output of labour
and poor infrastructure. The future of India’s iron and steel industry is bright due to India’s liberalisation policy
and foreign direct investment in the industry.

Industries have caused severe pollution of our natural resources. Industries cause environmental degradation
through four main types of pollution i.e. air pollution, water pollution, land pollution or soil degradation, and
noise pollution.
Smoke contains undesirable gases like carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide, besides solid and
liquid particulate matter, in the form of dust and spray mist, which cause air pollution. Air pollution affects the
health of humans, animals and plants alike and also causes damage to buildings.
Water pollution is caused by the discharge of untreated chemical waste like dyes, detergents, acids, heavy metals
like lead and mercury, pesticides, fertilisers, and plastics from industries, into fresh water bodies like rivers and
lakes. Solid wastes like fly ash, phospo-gypsum, and iron and steel slags also cause water pollution.
The industries that cause major amount o f water pollution are paper and pulp industries, oil refineries, tanneries
and electroplating industries. The discharge of hot water from thermal power plants into rivers before cooling is
called thermal pollution of water. Radioactive waste, hazardous chemicals, glass, plastic, industrial effluents and
non-biodegradable garbage are the main agents of land pollution. Rain water falling on polluted land dissolves
and carries many of the poll utants further into the ground and pollutes groundwater
groundwater..
Loud noise can lead to irritation, loss of hearing, and an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Industrial
machinery, construction activities, generators, and equipment like saws and pneumatic drills are mainly
responsible for noise pollution. One of the most important steps for the control of environmental degradation is
treating hot and polluted wastewater from industries before releasing it into our rivers and lakes.
Wastewater treatment involves :
(i) Primary treatment through screening,
screening, grinding, flocculation and sedimentation.
(ii) Secondary treatment through
through bacterial action to digest harmful chemicals.
(iii) T
Tertiary
ertiary stage of stirring with chemicals to neutralise remaining harmful waste.
Treated waste water can be recycled for reuse in industrial processes. Rainwater harvesting can be used to meet
the requirements of water for industrial processes.
Legal provisions must be made to regulate the use of groundwater for industrial use. Smoke stacks,
stacks, filters,
scrubbers, and electrostatic and inertial separators remove a large amount of harmful particles from industrial
smoke. The emission of smoke itself from industries can be reduced by using more efficient fuels like oil and
natural gas in place of coal.
Industrial and generator silencers, and sound-absorbing material are available to reduce the noise level in
industries. Industrial workers can use earphones and earplugs for i ndividual protection of health and hearing.
National Thermal Power Corporation or NTPC is a major electricity generation and distribution company in India.
NTPC has demonstrated how conservation of environment and natural resources can happen simultaneously

Set (68010) 2012]

Ans. Three steps to minimize the environmental
degradation caused by industrial development in
India are :
Every litre of waste water discharged by our
industry pollutes eight times the quantity of fresh
water.
(i) Minimizing use of water for processing by reusing
and recycling it in two or
o r more successive stages.
(ii) Harvesting of rain water to meet water
requirements.

(iii) Treating hot water and effluents before releasing
them in rivers and ponds.

Q. 2. How does industry pollute the environment ?
[NCERT]
Explain with three examples.
[Board, Term-II, Set (II022) 2012]
Ans. Industries are responsible for four types of
pollution i.e., :
(i) Air, (ii) Water, (iii) Noise, (iv) Land.


188 ]
(i) Air pollution is caused by the presence of high
proportion of undesirable gases, such as sulphur
dioxide and carbon monoxide. Smoke is emitted by
chemical and paper factories, brick kilns, refineries
and smelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in
big and small factories.
(ii) Water pollution is caused by organic and inorganic
industrial wastes and affluents discharged into
rivers. The main culprits in this regard are paper,
pulp, chemical, textile and dyeing, petroleum
refineries and electroplating industries that let out
dyes, detergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like
lead and mercury, pesticides, fertilisers, synthetic
chemicals with carbon, plastics and rubber, etc.,
into the water bodies.
(iii) Noise pollution is due to industrial and construction
activities. Machinery, factory equipment, generators,

Trade requires some means
means of exchanging ideas and connecting with people. This is where communication comes
in. While transport physically transfers people and goods from one place to another, means of communication
allow people in different locations to connect with each other without actually travelling.
Some common means of communication are radio, television, cinema, newspapers, Internet, fax and phone
services. A dense, efficient network of transport, and extensive, reliable means of communication are the true
lifelines of trade and economic development for India and the rest of the world.
There are
are five types of transport systems in India — roadways, railways, pipelines, waterways and airways.
Roadways : A number of roads were built during the Mughal rule. Sher Shah Suri built the Grand Trunk Road
from Chittagong (now in Bangladesh) in the east to Peshawar (now in Pakistan) in the west.
Railways : The railways are now more than 150 years old in India. The total track length of railways is about
115,000 km. While the total route length of the network in 68,525 km. India has the second largest railway
railway
network in Asia and the sixth largest railway network after USA, Russia, Canada, Germany and China. The Indian
Railways carry 40,000 lakh passengers and 4,000 lakh tonnes of goods a year. It had a fleet of 9,213 locomotives,
53,220 passenger service vehicles, 6,493 other coach vehicles and 2,29,381 wagons as on 31 st March 2011.
Pipelines were earlier used for the transportation of water and now they are being used for the transportation of
crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas.
Inland Waterway
aterwayss have a length of 14,500 km. The government has declared the following waterways as National
Waterways i.e. :
between Allahabad and Haldia (1,620

(i) Construction cost of roads is much lower than
that of railway lines and construction time is also
comparatively less.
(ii) Roads can traverse comparatively more dissected
and undulating topography which is a limitation
in case of railways.

(iii) Roads can negotiate higher gradients of slopes
and as such can traverse mountains like the
Himalayas, whereas the mountainous regions are
unfavourable for the construction of railway lines
due to high relief, sparse population and lack of
economic opportunities. Likewise, it is difficult
to lay railway lines on the sandy plains in the
deserts, swampy or forested tracks.

(iv) Road transport is economical in transportation
of few persons and relatively smaller amount
of goods over short distances, whereas railways
are suitable for transportation of large number of
people and goods in bulk, especially over long
distances.
(v) Roadways provide door-to-door service, thus the
cost of loading and unloading is much lower but
railways have not reached everywhere, still there
are places which are yet to be connected with the
railways.
(vi) Road transport is also used as a feeder to other
modes of transport such as they provide a link
between railway stations, air and seaports. On
the other hand, railways work as a lifeline for the
economic growth of a country as they carry raw

[Board Term–II, 2015]
Ans. Rail transport is the most convenient mode of
transportation. Though the railway network is
not evenly distributed across the country. The
distribution pattern of the railway network
in the country has been largely influenced by
physiographic, economic and administrative
factors.
Physiographic Factors : (i) The northern plains
with their vast level land, high p opulation density
and rich agricultural resources provide the most
favourable condition for their growth of railway
networks. (ii) The uneven terrain like hills,
mountains, rivers with wide beds have posed
severe obstacle in the infrastructural development
of railways like laying tracks, construction of
bridges and so on. (iii) In the hilly terrain of the
peninsular region, railway tracks are laid through
low hills, gaps or tunnels. (iv) The Himalayan
mountainous regions too are unfavourable for the
construction of railway lines due to high
relief, sparse population and lack of economic
opportunities. (v) It is equally difficult on the
sandy plain of western Rajasthan, swamps of
Gujarat, forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh,
Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand.
Economic Factors : (i) There are several economic
factors that affect the distribution of railways e.g.
state funding plays a vital role in the development
of railways across the nations. (ii) The state with
flexible laws supports the growth of railways.
Along with this the places that are highly
industrialised attract the development of railways.
Since the growth of both is complimentary to each
other e.g. recently railways network is enhancing

Ans. The three determinants of the outcomes of the

(i)

People’s perception : If people view their identities
to be exclusive and superior, it becomes difficult to
accommodate them.

(ii)

Role of community and culture : It depends upon
how political leaders raise demands on behalf of a
community. It is easier to accommodate demands
that are within the constitutional framework and
are not at the cost of another community.

of different communities also determines the
outcome. If the rulers are willing to share power

TOPIC-2
Types of Party Systems

Quick Review


Party system
There are three types of party systems :
(i) One-party system (ii) Two-party system and (iii) Multi-party system.
(i) One-Party System : In some countries only one party is allowed to control and run the government. There
is no competition in this system. The mono party nominates the candidates and the voters have only two
choices — (a) Not to vote at all or (b) write ‘yes’ or ‘no’ against the name of the candidates nominated by the
party. This system has been popular in Communist countries and other authoritarian regimes e.g., China,
North Korea and Cuba. This system was also prevalent in USSR till Communism collapsed.
(ii) Two-Party System : Power changes between two major, dominant parties. In this system, to win elections,
the winner has to get maximum number of votes, but not necessarily a majority of votes. The smaller parties
usually merge with the bigger parties or they drop out of elections. This parliamentary system prevails in
Great Britain and the United States of America, in which only two parties hold significant numbers of seats.
Supporters of this system believe that this prevents dangers of fragmentation (too many parties winning
seats from different constituencies) and the government can run smoothly.
(iii) Multi-Party
Multi-Party System : It is the most common type of party system. In this system, three or more parties have
the capacity to gain control of the government separately or in coalition. When no party gains a majority of
the legislative seats in multi-party parliamentary system, then several parties join hands and form a coalition
government. Supporters of this system point out that it allows more points of views to be represented in the
government. Critics of this system point out that multi-party system sometimes leads to political instability

changes in law can help to discourage wrong po litical practices and encourage good ones. (But legal-constitutional
changes by themselves cannot overcome challenges to democracy. Democratic reforms are to be carried out

incentives to do good things have more chances of working. The best laws are those which empower people to
carry out democratic reforms. (The Right to Information Act is a good example of a law that empowers the people
to find out what is happening in government and act as watch-dogs of democracy).
 Democratic reforms are to be brought about principally through
through political practice. Therefore, the main focus of
political reforms should be to increase and improve the quality of political participation by ordinary citizens.
 Any proposal for political reforms should think not only about what is a good solution but also about who will
implement it and how. Measures that rely on democratic movements, citizens’ organizations and the media are
likely to succeed.

What are the two bases of measuring economic
development of a country ?
[Board Term-I
Term-I DDE 2015-16, (580015,39), 2011]
Ans. Economic development means the rate of
production is greater than the rate of increase in
population and the rate of growth of GDP is high
enough to fulfil the basic needs of the population.
Two bases of measuring development of a country
are :
(i) Average or per capita income.
(ii) National income and public facilities.

Ans. Different persons could have different as well as
conflicting notions of a country’s development.
In fact; two persons or groups of persons may
seek things which are conflicting. To get more
electricity, industrialists may want more dams.
But this may submerge the land and disrupt the
lives of people who are displaced - such as tribes.
They might resent this and may prefer small

Ans. Development goals may be common, different or
conflicting :
(i) Common Goals : There are some needs which
are common to all like income, freedom, equality,
security, respect, friendship etc.
(ii) Different Goals : Development or progress does
not mean the same thing for every individual.
Each individual has his own idea of development.
For example, development for a farmer might be
irrigation facilities; for an unemployed youth it
may mean employment opportunities, etc.
(iii) Conflicting Goals : What may be development
for some may become destruction for some
others. Example : Industrialists may want dams
for electricity but such dams would displace the
natives of a region by submerging their land.

Ans. (i) Role of education : It plays a vital role in
the overall development of a human being and
society, therefore stress on imparting education
has been given up in our constitution.
(ii) Role of Health : The general health standard
in India is quite low. This is quite inevitable as
nearly one fourth of the population lives below

Ans. It is true
true that for development, people look at a
mix of goals, e.g. :
(i) If women
women are engaged in paid work, their dignity
in the household and society increases. So dignity
is an important goal.
(ii) However, it is also the case that if there
there is respect
for women there would be more sharing of
housework and greater acceptance of women
working outside.
(iii) A safe and secure environment may allow more
women to take up a variety of jobs or run a
business. These are goals other than income. Hence
development goal is not only for better income but

Ans. Use of averages to compare development :
(i) Averages are used for better understanding.

For comparison between countries, total income
is not very useful.

Public facilities are the facilities that are provided to the people by the government.
The provision of public services and facilities in the urban environment has a significant impact on the quality of
life that residents and others enjoy.
Public facilities play an essential role in providing support services to create viable, sustainable, healthy and
cohesive communities, overcoming social bar riers and raising achievement.
Money alone cannot buy all the goods and services that one may need to live well.
Income by itself is not a completely adequate indicator of material goods and services that citizens are able to use.
Government has to provide certain essential facilities like healthcare, sanitation, electricity, public transport and
educational institutions.
Kerala has a low Infant Mortality Rate because it has adequate provision of basic health and educational facilities.

Sustainable Development : Sustainable development is maintaining a delicate balance between the human need
to improve lifestyles and feeling of well-being on one hand, and preserving natural resources and ecosystems, on
which we and future generations depend.
Organic Farming : Vegetable and livestock production using natural sources of nutrients (such as compost, crop
residues, and manure) and natural methods of crop and weed control, instead of using synthetic or inorganic
agro chemicals.

¾

Fossil Fuels : A natural fuel such as coal or gas, formed in the geologic al past from the remains of living organisms.

¾

Global Farming : a gradual increase in the overall temperature of the earth’s atmosphere generally attributed to
the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and other pollutants.

Ans. Classification of economic sectors on the basis of
nature of activities are as follows :
(i) Primary sector : When we produce goods by
exploiting natural resources, it is an activity of the
primary sector, such as agriculture, dairy farming,
fishing, forestry.
(ii) Secondary sector : In this, natural products are
changed into other forms through manufacturing
that we associate with industrial activity. The
product is not produced by nature but has
to be made and therefore, some process of
manufacturing is essential. For example, using
cotton fibre from the plant we spin, yarn and
weave cloth.
(iii) Tertiary sector : It helps in the development of
the primary and secondary sectors. They provide
aid or a support for the production process.
Transport, storage, communication, banking,

Underemployment or Disguised unemployment means more people engaged in a job than needed.
More employment can be created in a country like India by building more dams and canals to provide water to
the farmers, by providing cheap credit facilities and crop insurance, by spending more money on transport and
storage, technical training and by providing cheap bank loan at cheaper interests.
A study conducted by the Planning Commission of India estimates that nearly 20 lakh jobs can be created in the
education sector alone.
In our country, the Central Government made a law implementing the Right to Work in 200 districts and the next
ended to an additional 130 di stricts. It is called National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (NREGA, 2005).
G.D .P. is the sum of the money value of final goods and services produced in each sector during a particular year
within domestic territory of a country.
The objectives of implementing MGNREGA 2005 were :
(i) To give employment opportunities to the people who live in rural areas.
(ii) To raise the standard of living of the people.
(iii) To implement the right to work.

Q. 1. Explain
the
meaning
of
disguised
unemployment with the help of any two
erm-I,, (B1), 2010]
suitable examples. [Board Term-I
Ans. Disguised unemployment : When the people
are working in any field for more than their
labour necessity. For example, where the need
is for 4 labourers and 7 labourers are working, it
means 3 labourers are suffering from disguised
unemployment or under-employment. In such a
case, the production will not be affected even if the
three extra labour do not work.
Examples :
(i) In rural
rural India, agricultural field is suffering
suffering from
this type of unemployment. More than half of the
workers in the country are working in primary
sector mainly in agricultural activities producing
only a quarter of G.D.P.
(ii) In urban areas, workers like painters,
painters, plumbers,
plumbers,
repair persons, cart drivers do not find work every
3+2=5
day or for the whole day.
Q. 2. Explain measures that can be adopted to
remove disguised unemployment in the
agriculture sector.
[Board Term-I, (580021, 27), 2011]
Ans. When more people are compelled to do a job which
only few can do, then such a situation is termed as
disguised unemployment.
(i) One or two members
members of farmer’s family can work
in the farms of big landlord and earn wages.
(ii) Two or three members of such a family may move
to work in a nearby factory and earn more money.
(iii) More irrigational facilities can be provided to grow
two or three crops in a year.
(iv) By opening processing units of agriculture
production, more employment opportunities can
be created.
(v) Technical, vocational training can reduce the
1×5=5
unemployment of farmers.
Q. 3. Why is agriculture the most labour absorbing
sector in India ? How does disguised
unemployment make it worse ? Explain
E xplain with an
[Board Term-I
erm-I,, (R9UJGYG), 2014]
example.
Ans. (i) Agriculture is the most labour absorbing sector
in India because the secondary and tertiary sectors
are still failed to provide more employment
opportunities as to a majority of the Indian people,

Oswaal CBSE Question Bank, SOCIAL SCIENCE, Class – 10
5 marks each
so the people are forced to engage themselves in
agriculture.
(ii) Disguised unemployment
unemployment it generally found in
agriculture sector. People engaged in farming are
generally more than required. Though it seems
that they are working in the cultivation of land, but
actually they are partly employed.
(iii) For example : A farmer who has a land of 3 hectare
which require only 2 persons for farming related to
work but all the 7 family members are engaged in
it. If 5 persons out of them are with drawn from the
job, the total production will not fall. Therefore, 5
persons will come under the category of disguised
2+3=5
unemployment.
Q. 4. What is GDP? Explain the process to calculate
[Board Term-I, (82), 2012]
GDP.
Ans. (i) Gross Domestic Product or GDP is the value
of all final goods and services produced within a
country, during a particular year.
(ii) The sum of production in the three sectors give us
the GDP (primary + secondary + tertiary). The
money values of goods and services should be
added rather than adding up the actual numbers.
The value of final goods alone should be added as
the value of intermediate goods is already included
in the value of final goods. This mammoth task
of measuring GDP is undertaken by the Central
Government Ministry.
This organization collects information relating to
the total volume of goods and services and their
2+3=5
prices and then estimates the GDP.
Q. 5. How can we create more employment in
secondary and tertiary sectors in rural India ?
[Board Term-I,
Term-I, (45, 47), 2012]
Ans. (i) W
Wee can create more jobs in the secondary sector
by promoting industries such as dal mills.
(ii) By promoting cottage and handicraft industries
to employ the villagers. By tying up industries to
promote processing of vegetables and fruits.
(iii) Government can invest in cold storages.
(iv) Services like transportation and communication
must be promoted to generate employment.
(v) Building Multi-purpose Projects can create
employment.
Q. 6. How can we create more employment
opportunities in urban areas ? Explain with

OR
Describe the various ways in which government
can create employment opportunities for the
people of India.
[Board Term-I,
Term-I, (Set-6HTQGTF), 2016-17]

Ans. (i) The government can spend some money or
banks can provide loans to construct well etc.,
which will reduce the dependency of farmers on
rains, and they will be able to grow two crops a
year.
(ii) Construction of Dams and Canals can lead to lot
of generation of employment in agricultural sector
itself.
(iii) If government
g overnment invests some money on
on
transportation and storage of crops or makes
better rural roads, it can provide productive
employment not just to farmers but also to other
who are in services like transport or trade.
(iv) If local banks give credits
credits at reasonable rates
rates to the
small and marginal-farmers, they will be able to
buy necessary inputs for their crops in time.
(v) Another way to solve this problem is to identify
identify,,
promote and locate industries and services in the
semi-rural areas where a large number of people
may be employed. Example : Many farmers grow
arhar and chickpea, for them a dall-mill to procure
and process these & sell in the cities; opening
a cold storage will give an opportunity to the
farmers to store their produce like potato, & onion
and sell them at good price; villagers near forests
can start with honey collection etc.

(vi) To improve health situation we need health
centres, hospitals & for that doctors, nurses,
workers.
(vii) Similarly to provide education to all children we
would need lot of schools which can also generate
employment.
(viii) Tourism : Every state or region has the potential
for increasing the income and employment for
people in that area. This can also be done by
promoting tourism or regional craft industry.
(ix) New services
services like IT are also creating jobs.
All these are the long term projects but government
also has certain short term projects for people :

Ans. Money acts as a medium to exchange itself for
goods and services : A person holding money can
easily exchange it for any commodity or service
that he or she might want.

Everyone prefers to receive payments in money
and exchange the money for things they want.
For example : A shoemaker wants to sell shoes in
the market and buy wheat. The shoemaker will
first exchange shoes for money and then exchange
the money for wheat. If the shoemaker had to
directly exchange shoes for wheat without the
use of money, he would have to look for a wheat
growing farmer who not only wants to sell wheat
but also wants to buy the shoe in exchange. Both
the parties have to agree to sell and buy each

collateral. Absence of collateral is one of the major
reasons which prevents the poor from getting

the earnings of the borrowers is used to repay the
loan. Hence, borrowers have less income left for
themselves.
(ii) In certain cases, the hig h interest rate of borrowing
can mean that the amount to be repaid is greater
than the income of the borrower. This could
lead to increasing debt and debt trap. For these
reasons, banks and co-operative societies need to
lend more.

Ans. (i) Unfair trade practices : Some traders and
shopkeepers indulge in unethical or unfair trade
practices. They cheat the customers by giving
them articles of substandard quality.
Duplicate items are also available in the market
but they look so genuine that even wise and clever
customers fail to differentiate them. Similarly,
underweighing tactics are very common among
shopkeepers. They give less quantity but charge
more than the actual.
(ii) Adulteration and impurity : It is also a common
practice where manufacturers of ghee, oil, butter
etc. resort to adulteration. These activities increase
their profit margin causing loss to the customers.
Sometimes it proves very injurious to the health
of the customers.
(iii) Artificial scarcity : Shortage of essential items in
the market is the result of hoarding. In order to get
more profit, certain unscrupulous traders resort to
hoarding of these goods thereby creating artificial
scarcity. After sometime they sell these products
at higher prices.
(iv) False or incomplete information : At times false
information is passed on through the media and
through other methods to attract consumers.
This activity causes monetary loss as well as
1¼ × 4 = 5
