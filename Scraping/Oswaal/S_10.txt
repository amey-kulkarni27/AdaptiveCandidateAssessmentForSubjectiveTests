CBSE always believes in Global Trends of Educational Transformation and Continual lmprovement Process
which means that the Board continually examines its processes and curriculum to evolve and find resonance
amongst the educational fraternity. In this context, CBSE had restored Class X Board examination from the
academic year 2017-18 doing awaywith the CCE pattern. Further to this, an 1Sth March 2018, CBSE released an
updated curriculum for Academic Year 2018-2019 an which these latest edition of Oswaal Question Banks are
based.
We at Oswaal Books are always proactive to follow the changes proposed by the Board and implement the
same as soon as possible to put the students, parents and teachers at ease. The Oswaal Question Banks have
been modified and rewritten as per the latest Board guidelines in order to supplement the need of the students
du ring the entire academicyear!
As the CBSE remodeled assessment structure is divided in two major parts namely Interna! Assessment and
Board Examinations, Oswaal Question Banks have been designed to assist students to prepare for their periodic
tests, internal assignments as weil as the Board examinations with equal ease. Oswaal Question Banks will not
only help students with regular studies but will also equip the teachers with the most updated study material for
theclass.
The Question Banks have been designed with a lot of care and attention to details. All chapters are arranged
'TOPICWISE' where each topic is explained in detail and covers all typologies of Questions specified by CBSE,
with weil labelled diagrams and high quality figures/diagrams for fast learning. Answers from CBSE Marking
scheme are highlighted in order to specify the correct method of answering questions for attaining maximum
marks. We hope to make Oswaal Question Banks a student's best companion to sail through the entire
academic year smoothly.
Same of the key highlights of Oswaal Question Banks are:
1. Chapterwise/Topicwise presentation for systematic and methodical study
2. Previous Years' Examination Questions with Marking Scheme & Toppers' Answers for exam-oriented
study
3. Remembering, Understanding, Application, HOTs & Evaluation Based Question for exam-oriented
preparation
4. Mind Maps in each chapterfor making learning simple.
Last but not the least, we would like to offer heartfelt gratitude to our authors, editors, reviewers and
specially students who regularly send us suggestions which helps in continuous improvement of this book and
makes it stand out as "One of the Best" in its category.
We, at Oswaal Books, wish you all a very Happy Learning and a successful 2018-19!!
-Team Oswaal

Why Topic Wise Question Banks Are A Better Choke than Previous Year' s Papers ?

Question Banks

Previous Years' Papers

1. Chapter-wise and Topic-wise presentation
in Question Banks facilitates systematic
study.

1. Year Wise presentation restricts methodical
flow of learning.

2. Question Banks can be referred to by the
students throughout the year as weil as at
the completion of each chapter in school.

2. These can be referred to only after the
completion of the full syllabus in school.

3. Question Banks, take into account any
changes in syllabus or layout and hence are
fully updated and aligned as per the latest
specifications bythe Board.

3. Previous Years' questions cannot be
changed and hence fail tobe adept with the
latest Board specifications

A dam is built to control water through placement of a blockage of earth, rock across a stream or river. They
usually store water in a reservior, which is then used for a variety of applications such as irrigation and municipal
water supplies.
		
Three main problems that arise because of the construction of big dams are :
		
(i) Construction of dams across rivers leads to deforestation, which results in the loss of biodiversity.
		
(ii) Constructing reservoir may result in the flooding of nearby towns and villages.
		
(iii) Construction of dams requires a huge amount of monetary investments.

(i) Ovary : It helps is the production of female gametes and female hormones.
(ii) Oviduct : It is a site of fertilisation and transfer female gamete from ovary.
(iii) Uterus : It helps in implantation of zygote and nourishes developing embryo.
Placenta is a special tissue that helps human embryo in obtaining nutrition from mother's blood.
Structure : This is a disc which is embedded in the uterine wall which contains villi on the embryo side of the
tissue, and on the mother's side are blood spaces which surround the villi.
			
Function : It helps in nourishment of the embryo. It helps in exchange of gases by providing O2 and removal
of CO2 from the foetus. It is also involved in removal of wastes generated by embryo through the placenta.

Stars are very distant and approximately point-sized sources. Path of star light changes continuously due to
gradual changing of refractive index of the layers of earth's atmosphere. Thus, the apparent position of the
stars fluctuates and the amount of star light entering the eye flickers giving the twinkling effect.

(i) Cornea : If refracts most of the light into eyes.
(ii) Iris : Gives colour to eyes, controls size of pupil.
(iii) Crystaline Lens : Focuses the image of the object on the retina.
(iv) Ciliary Muscles : Holds the eye lens and adjusts its focal length.
Early in the morning, the sun is near the horizon, sunlight reaches us after travelling a longer distance through
thick layers of atmosphere. Thus, most of the blue light and shorter wavelength are scattered away by the
particles in the atmosphere. The light that reaches us is of longer wavelengths giving a reddish appearance.
This phenomenon will not be observed by an astronaut on the moon, because of the absence of atmosphere
on the moon.

Fleming's Left Hand Rule :
Fleming's Left Hand Rule : Stretch the first three fingers of the left hand mutually perpendicular to each
other such that the forefinger points the direction of magnetic field, the middle finger points the direction of
current, then the thumb will indicate the direction of force experienced by the conductor.
Electric motor works on the principle of force experienced by a current carrying conductor in a magnetic
field. The two forces in the opposite sides are equal and opposite.
(i) Armature : It is a rectangular iron core wrapped by copper coil through which electricity passes and due
to magnetic field it experiences a force and rotates.
(ii) Brushes : It conducts current between stationary wires and moving parts, most commonly in a rotating
shaft.
(iii) Split Ring : It helps to reverse the direction of current in the circuit.

22. When aluminium is added to test tubes A and B containing aqueous solutions of iron sulphate and copper
sulphate, aluminium will displace both iron and copper from their salt solutions as aluminium is more reactive
than both iron and copper. Also, iron when added to test tube C containing aluminium sulphate will not react
but will displace copper from its salt solution in test tube D. Hence, the colour change will take place in test tubes
A, B and D and no colour will take place in C. Aluminium is the most reactive metal of all as it can displace both
iron and copper from their salt solutions.

reaction.
and Rancidity
.... P. 11
The substances which take part in chemical reaction are called
Reactants.
The substances which are formed in a chemical reaction are called
Products.
Examples : Where chemical reactions takes place :
(i) Digestion of food
(ii) Respiration
(iii) Rusting of iron
(iv) Burning of Magnesium ribbon
(v) Formation of curd
A chemical reaction can be identified by either of the following observations :
(i) Change in state
(ii) Change in colour
(iii) Evolution of gas
(iv) Change in temperature
(v) Formation of a precipitate
Writing a chemical equation :
(i) The symbols of elements and the formulae of reacting substances are written on the left hand side with a
plus (+) sign between them.
(ii) The symbols and formulae of the substances formed are written on the right hand side with a plus sign
(+) between them.
(iii) An arrow (→) sign is put between the reactants and the products.
(iv) The physical states of the reactants and products are also mentioned in a chemical equation.
Balanced Equations : The equations in which atoms of various elements on both sides of a chemical equation
are equal in accordance with the law of conservation of mass.
The process of making atoms of various elements equal on either side of an equation is called balancing of chemical
equation. This method of balancing the equation is known as hit and trial method.

Oswaal CBSE Question Bank, SCIENCE, Class – 10

		 STEPWISE BALANCING (Hit and Trial)
		 Step 1. Write a chemical equation and draw boxes around each formula.
Fe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2
 Do not change anything inside the box.
		 Step 2. Count the number of atoms of each element on both the sides of chemical equation.
Element

No. of atoms at
reactant side

No. of atoms at product side

1.

Fe

2.

H

3. O
1
4
		 Step 3. Equalise the number of atoms of element which has maximum number by putting in front of it.
Fe + 4H2O → Fe3O4 + H2
		 Step 4. Try to equalize all the atoms of elements on reactant and product side by adding coefficient in front of it.
3Fe + 4H2O → Fe3O4 + 4H2
 Now all the atoms of elements are equal on both sides.
		 Step 5. Write the physical states of reactants and products.
3Fe (s) + 4H2O (g) → Fe3O4 (s) + 4H2 (g)
		 Solid state = (s)
		 Liquid state = (l)
		 Gaseous state = (g)
		 Aqueous state = (aq)
		 Step 6. Write necessary conditions of temperature, pressure or catalyst on arrow above or below.
		 TYPES OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS
I. COMBINATION REACTION : The reaction in which two or more reactant combine to form a single product.
		 e.g., (i) Burning of coal
				
C (s) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g)
			 (ii) Formation of water
				 2H2 (g) + O2 (g) → 2H2O (l)
			 (iii) CaO (s) + H2O (l) → Ca (OH)2 (aq)
				
Quick lime
Slaked lime
		 Exothermic Reactions : Reaction in which heat is released along with formation of products.
		 e.g., (i) Burning of natural gas.
				 CH4 (g) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2H2O (g) + Heat
		
(ii) Respiration is also an exothermic reaction.
				 C6H12O6 (aq) + 6O2 (g) → 6CO2 (aq) + 6H2O (l) + energy
II. DECOMPOSITION REACTION : The reaction in which a compound splits into two or more simple substances is
called decomposition reaction.
A→B+C
 Thermal decomposition : When decomposition is carried out by heating.
		 e.g., (i)

2FeSO4 (s) Heat

→ Fe2O3 (s) + SO2 (g) + SO3 (g)

				
				

(Ferrous sulphate)
Green colour

(Ferric oxide)
Red-brown colour

(ii) CaCO3 (s) Heat

→ CaO (s) + CO2 (g)

		

				
(Lime stone)
(Quick lime)
 Electrolytic Decomposition : When decomposition is carried out by passing electricity.
		 e.g.,


Electric

→ 2H2 + O2
2H2O current

Photolytic Decomposition : When decomposition is carried out in presence of sunlight.
Sunlight

		 e.g., (i)

2AgCl (s) 
→ 2Ag (s) + Cl2 (g)

				

2AgBr (s) 
→ 2Ag (s) + Br2 (g)



Sunlight

Above reaction is used in black and white photography.

[ 3

CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND EQUATIONS



Endothermic Reaction : The reactions which require energy in the form of heat, light or electricity to break reactants
are called endothermic reactions.

III. DISPLACEMENT REACTION : The chemical reactions in which more reactive element displaces less reactive

Reduction : Reduction is just reverse of oxidation. It is a process of losing oxygen during a reaction.

		

In this reaction CuO is reduced to Cu and H2 is oxidized H2O. In other words, one reactant gets oxidised while the
other gets reduced. Such reactions are called oxidation-reduction reactions or redox reactions.



Corrosion : The surface of the reactive metals are attacked by air, water and other substances around it, and
corrodes, the process is called corrosion. It is a redox reaction where metal gets oxidised to metal oxide and oxygen
gets reduced to oxide ion.

Valency : The number of electrons shared by an atom is called its valency. It is also called the combining capacity
of an atom, e.g., chlorine atom can share one valence electron as its valency is 1, oxygen can share two valence
electrons as its valency is 2.



Chemical equation : It is a complete symbolic representation of a chemical reaction involving reactants and
products.



Balanced equation : It is the equation in which atoms of various elements on the reactants and the products side
are equal. The number of atoms of elements on both the sides of a chemical equation should be equal in accordance

Ans. Rancidity.
Anti-oxidant is a substance which prevents
oxidation, actually reducing agents. When added
to food, the fats and oils present in the food do not
get oxidized easily, hence do not turn rancid and
remain good to eat for longer time.

CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND EQUATIONS

Detailed Answer : Rancidity.
Antioxidants are substances that inhibit oxidation,
especially one used to counteract the deterioration
of stored food products.
Antioxidants are added to the food materials
containing fats and oils to prevent their oxidation.
Oxidation of food materials containing fats and oils
is known as rancidity because of which they become
unfit for consumption and develop bad odour.

Chemical Properties of Acids and Bases
Reaction of Metals with
		
Acids
Bases
Acid + Metal → Salt + Hydrogen gas
Base + Metal → Salt + Hydrogen gas
e.g., 2HCl + Zn → ZnCl2 + H2
e.g., 2NaOH + Zn → Na2ZnO2 + H2 ↑
			
(Sodium zincate)
 Hydrogen gas released can be tested by ringing burning candle near gas bubbles, it burst with pop sound.
Reaction of Metal Carbonates / Metal Hydrogen Carbonates with
		
Acids
Bases
Acid + Metal Carbonate / Metal hydrogen Carbonate → Base + Metal Carbonate / Metal Hydrogen Carbonate
Salt + CO2 + H2O
e.g., 2HCl + Na2CO3 → 2NaCl + CO2 + H2O → No Reaction
HCl + NaHCO3 → NaCl + CO2 + H2O
 CO2 can be tested by passing it through lime water.
Ca (OH)2 + CO2 → CaCO3 + H2O
(Lime water turns milky.)
 When excess CO2 is passed,
CaCO3 + CO2 + H2O → Ca(HCO)3
(Milkiness disappears.)
Reaction of Acids and Bases With Each Other
Acid + Base → Salt + H2O
Neutralisation Reaction : Reaction of acid with base is called as neutralization reaction.
e.g., HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O
IF :
Strong Acid + Weak Base → Acidic salt + H2O
Weak Acid + Strong Base → Basic salt + H2O
Strong Acid + Strong Base → Neutral salt + H2O
Weak Acid + Weak Base → Neutral salt + H2O
 pH of stomach is 1.5-3.0 due to secretion of HCl. In case of indigestion, acidity increases which can be neutralized
by antacids like milk of magnesia.
 Cold drinks, chocolates and sweets are most harmful for health as well as tooth. They produce acids in mouth
which are responsible for tooth decay.
 Salts of a strong acid and a strong base are neutral with pH value of 7.
 Salts have various uses in everyday life and in industries.
 A salt is soluble if it dissolves in water to give a solution with a concentration of at least 0.1 moles per litre at room
temperature.
pH Scale : A scale for measuring H+ ion concentration in a solution. p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ a German word
which means power.

Know the Terms


Those substances which turn blue litmus solution red are called acidic. The term ‘acid’ has been derived from the
Latin word ‘acidus’ which means sour. Acids are sour in taste. They give H+ ions in aqueous solution.
Example : HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, CH3COOH.

26 ]

Oswaal CBSE Question Bank, SCIENCE, Class – 10

Those substances which change their colour (or odour) in acidic or basic solutions are called indicators.
The acids which are obtained from minerals are called mineral acids. Those acids which are obtained from plants and
animals are called organic acids. Those acids which contain minimum amount of water are called concentrated acids.
 The acids which ionise almost completely are called strong acids, e.g., mineral acids.
 The acids which ionise only partially or to a lesser extent are called weak acids, e.g., organic acids.
 Substances that furnish hydroxide ions (OH–) in aqueous solution are called bases. Bases have bitter taste and
produce blue colour in litmus solution.
 The substances / bases which ionise completely to furnish OH– ions are called strong bases, e.g., KOH, NaOH etc.
The bases which ionise only partially are called weak bases, e.g., Mg(OH)2, Cu(OH)2 etc.
 Water soluble bases are called alkalies, e.g., NaOH, KOH. Thus, all alkalies are bases but all bases are not alkali.
 When a concentrated acid or base is diluted, a vigorous reaction takes place. The process is called dilution. It is an
exothermic process as a lot of heat is produced.
 The process of forming ions in aqueous solution is called ionisation. All ionic compounds like NaCl, NaNO3,
Na2SO4 form ions in aqueous solution.
 A universal indicator is a mixture of many different indicators which shows a gradual but well marked series of
colour changes over a very wide range of change in concentration of H+ ions.
 pH is the scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration. The concentrations of H+ are generally small, therefore
concentrations of H+ are expressed in terms of pH. pH is defined as negative logarithm of H+ concentration or
H3O+ concentration.
		
pH = – log [H+] or pH = – log [H3O+]
 The reaction in which base or basic oxide reacts with acid or acidic oxide is called neutralisation reaction.


Example :
NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) 
A salt is an ionic compound that results from the neutralization reaction of an acid and a base. Salts are composed of
related numbers of cations and anions, so that, the product is electrically neutral.

Q. 8. Explain why sour substances are effective in
cleaning Copper vessels ?
[DDE 2017]
Ans. Copper metal slowly reacts with water, carbon
dioxide and oxygen present in air to form basic
copper carbonate which is green in colour. Its
layer slowly gets deposited on the surface of the
metal. Now as lemon is acidic, hence when we
rub the tarnished copper vessel with lemon, the
basic copper oxide or copper carbonate reacts with
the acid present in lemon to form a salt which is
washed away with water.
Q. 9. What is the reaction called when an acid reacts

Q. 15. A knife, which is used to cut a fruit, was
immediately dipped into water containing
drops of blue litmus solution. If the colour of
the solution is changed to red, what inference
can be drawn about the nature of the fruit and
why ?
[Board Term-I Set-A1, 2013, 11, 2010]
Ans. The fruit may be a citrus fruit or its juice may contain
an acid, that is why the traces of acid remained in
the knife that turned the blue litmus red.

Q. 17. Hold one moist and one dry strip of blue litmus
paper over dry HCl acid gas. Which strip will
turn red and why ?
[DDE 2017]
Ans. Dry strip of litmus and dry HCl do not contain any
water so do not get ionize, but in the presence of a
drop of water, HCl is ionized and release proton,
that turns blue litmus to red.
2
Q. 18. A student prepared solutions of (i) an acid

and (ii) a base in two separate beakers. She
forgot to label the solutions and litmus paper
is not available in the laboratory. Since both
the solutions are colourless, how will she
distinguish between the two ?
[NCERT Exemplar 2017]
Ans. These solutions can be tested by using universal
indicators. If solution (i) turns red it is an acid and If
solution (ii) remains colourless it is a base.
1+1
Q. 19. Why do acids not show acidic behaviour in the
absence of water ?
[NCERT 2017]
Ans. Acids do not show acidic behaviour in the absence
of water because the dissociation of hydrogen ions
from an acid occurs in the presence of water only. 2
Q. 20. Dry HCl gas does not change the colour of dry
blue litmus paper. Give reasons.
[NCERT Exemplar; Board Term-I Set-20, 2011]
Ans. In dry state, HCl gas does not give any H+ ions. It
does not behave as an acid. That is why the colour
of litmus paper does not change.

Q. 21. While diluting an acid, why is it recommended
that the acid should be added to water and not
water to the acid.
[Board Term-I Set-18, 2011 Set-C1, 2010]
Ans. Dilution of concentrated acid is an exothermic
process. If water is added to a concentrated acid,
the heat generated may cause the mixture to splash
out and cause burns. When the acid is added to
water slowly with constant stirring, the mixture will
not splash out.

Q. 23. After drinking excess of cold drink, a person
suffered from acidity. Explain.

[ 33

ACIDS, BASES AND SALTS

Ans. Cold drinks contain carbon dioxide dissolved in
them under pressure. Some amount of the gas
escapes when a bottle of cold drink is opened while
a portion of it remains dissolved. Carbon dioxide

dissolved in water forms a weak acid, carbonic
acid. Consumption of excess of cold drink causes
accumulation of carbonic acid in the stomach which
is responsible for the development of acidity.

Q. 4. Farmers are using a large number of pesticides
and fertilizers in their fields to increase crop
production and to enhance their profits. But by
doing so, they are causing damage to the soil as
well as to the environment. Do you agree with this
statement ? Why should we avoid eating fruits and
vegetables without washing them properly ?
3
Ans. Plants require a specific pH range for their healthy
growth. However by using a large number of
pesticides and fertilizers, the pH of the soil changes
which makes it more acidic or basic. So in the long
run the soil becomes infertile. This also leads to the
soil erosion causing damage to the environment.
Hence, excessive use of these pesticides and
fertilizers should be restricted as it is causing damage
to the soil as well as environment.

Q. 5. Acids are the substances which turn blue litmus
solution red and are sour in taste. There are
different types of acids like mineral acids, organic
acids, dilute acids and concentrated acids. All
living things are very sensitive to acids and too
much acids can kill cells or stop proper working
of the cells. Concentrated acids are very dangerous
and should never be handled without protection.
(i) What are organic acids ? Give two examples.
(ii) Why concentrated acids are dangerous ?
(iii) Comment on the statement — ‘‘Regular drinking
of cold drinks and eating of chocolates should be
avoided.’’ Give a valid reason to justify.
3
Ans. (i) The acids which are obtained from plants and
animals are called organic acids.
Citric acid is obtained from lemon.
Vinegar contains acetic acid.
(ii) Concentrated acids are very hot when they fall on
any object (clothes or skin), they burn the object.
(iii) Cold drinks, chocolates and sweets are most
harmful for health as well as tooth. They produce

METALS AND NON-METALS

[ 49

I. Physical Properties
A. Reaction with Air :
Metals combine with oxygen to form metal oxide.
Metals + O2 → Metal oxide
Examples :
(i) 2Cu + O2 → 3CuO
			
Copper oxide (black)
(ii) 4Al + 3O2 → 2Al2O3
			
Aluminium oxide
(iii) 2Mg + O2 → 2MgO
Different metals show different reactivities towards O2.
 Na and K react so vigorously that they catch fire if kept in open so they are kept immersed in kerosene.
 Surfaces of Mg, Al, Zn, Pb are covered with a thin layer of oxide which prevent them from further oxidation.
 Fe does not born on heating but iron fillings burn vigorously.
 Cud does not burn but is coated with black copper oxide.
 Au and Ag does not react with oxygen.
Amphoteric Oxides : Metal oxides which react with both acids as well as bases to produce salts and water called
amphoteric oxides.
Examples : Al2O3 + 6HCl → 2AlCl3 + H2O
Al2O3 + 2NaOH → 2NaAlO2 + H2O
		
Sodium Aluminate
(B) Reaction of Metals with Water :
Metal + Water → Metal oxide + Hydrogen
Metal oxide + Water → Metal hydroxide
(D) Reaction of Metals with Solutions of other Metal Salts :
Metal A + Salt solution B ↑ Salt solution A + Metal B
 Reactive metals can displace less reactive metals from their compounds in solution form.
Fe + CuSO4 → FeSO4 + Cu
 All the metals do not react with the same rate. Some react very fast, some react moderately whereas others react
very slowly. The series of metals in decreasing order of reactivity is called reactivity or activity series of metals. The
metals at the top are most reactive whereas metals at the bottom are less reactive.
		
K, Na, Ca, Mg, Al, Zn, Fe, Sn, Pb, H, Cu, Hg, Ag, Au, Pt.
 Metals react with dilute acids to form salt and hydrogen gas. The metal replaces hydrogen of the acid to form salt.
 Aqua Regia is a mixture of conc. HCl and conc. HNO3 in the ratio of 3 : 1. It can dissolve gold and platinum. Aqua
Regia is a strong oxidising agent due to the formation of NOCl (Nitrosyl chloride) and chlorine produced by
reaction of two acids.
 Alloys are homogenous mixture of two or more metals. One of them can be non-metal also, e.g., Brass is an alloy of
copper and zinc. When a metal is alloyed with mercury, it is called amalgam.
 Metal, in reactivity series, if placed above hydrogen, can displace hydrogen from dilute acids (HCl and H2SO4).
Ionic Compounds
The compounds formed by the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal are called ionic compounds or
electrovalent compounds.
Properties of Ionic Compounds
1. Physical nature : The are solid and hard, generally brittle.
2. Melting and Boiling Point : They have high melting and boiling point.
3. Solubility : Generally soluble in water and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol etc.
4. Conduction of electricity : Ionic compounds conduct electricity in molten and solution form but not in solid
state.
Occurrence of Metals
Minerals : The elements or compounds which occur naturally in the earth’s crust are called minerals.
Ores : Minerals that contain very high percentage of particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted
from it , such minerals are called ores.

The ability of a metal due to which it can be beaten into sheets is called malleability. Iron, copper, zinc and aluminium
are available in the form of a sheets. Aluminium, steel, copper, brass and bronze are used in making utensils.
Ductility is the ability of metal due to which it can be drawn into wires. Copper, aluminium and iron can be drawn
into wires. Silver, gold and platinum are highly ductile metals.
Electrical conductance is the property due to which electric current can pass through the metal. It is due to presence
of free electrons or mobile electrons. Copper, silver, gold and aluminium are good conductors of electricity.
Thermal conductivity is the property due to which metals can conduct heat. e.g., Copper, silver, aluminium, gold
and iron are good conductors of heat.
The process of forming oxide layer on the surface of metal is called anodising, e.g., Aluminium forms an oxide layer
on its surface when it is exposed to air. It is non-penetrating layer which protects it from corrosion.
Metals in their pure state have bright shining surfaces. This property is called metallic lustre.
When metals are struck with a hard substance, they produce sound. This property is called sonority and the metals
are said to be sonorous.
Those bases, which are soluble in water are called alkalies. Example, NaOH, KOH, Ca(OH)2. The oxides which
react with acids or acidic oxides to form salt and water are called Basic oxides. Example, Na2O, CaO, K2O, MgO. The
oxides which react with bases or basic oxides to form salt and water are called Acidic oxides. Example, CO2, SO2,
SO3, P2O5 etc.
The oxides which are both acidic or basic in nature and react both with acids and bases to form salt and water are
called as Amphoteric oxide. Example, ZnO, Al2O3 etc.
The oxides which are neither acidic nor basic in nature, they are known as Neutral oxides. They neither react with
acids nor with bases. Some non-metals form neutral oxides. Example, CO, NO, N2O etc.
The compounds in which metal loses electrons and non-metal gains electrons are called electrovalent compounds
or ionic compounds. Example, NaCl, KCl etc.

 A stable group of eight electrons in the outermost orbit of the atom is known as Octet.
		
The bond which is formed by loss and gain of electrons is called ionic or electrovalent bond.
 Ionic compounds or electrovalent compounds are solid, hard and brittle due to strong force of attraction between
them. They have high melting and boiling points. These compounds are soluble in water but insoluble in organic
solvents.
 Corrosion is a process in which metal reacts with substance present in the atmosphere to form surface compounds
e.g., silver metal turns black due to formation of Ag2S, iron forms reddish brown coating of hydrated ferric oxide,
Fe2O3.xH2O.
 The process of coating iron articles with zinc which is more reactive than iron is called Galvanisation.
 Metallurgy : All the processes involved in the extraction of metals from their ores and refining them for use, is
called metallurgy.
 Ore-dressing is a process of removing unwanted substances from the ore. This is also known as concentration
of the ore or enrichment of ore. It is usually done by hydraulic washing, magnetic separation or froth floatation
process.
 Froth floatation process is based on the principle that the mineral particles are more wetted by the oil, whereas the
gangue particles are more wetted by water. Compressed air is bubbled through the mixture. As a result of agitation,
oil froth is formed which contains minerals which float on the top of water and can be separated easily.
 The unwanted material present in the ores mined from earth is called Gangue. It needs to be removed prior to the
extraction process.
 Leaching makes use of difference in the chemical properties of minerals and gangue. The ore is treated with
suitable reagent which reacts with the ore, but not with the gangue. The purified ore is regenerated by sequence of
reactions. An example of leaching is Baeyer’s method of obtaining pure aluminium oxide from Bauxite.
 Roasting is the process in which ore is heated in the presence of air so as to obtain metal oxides, which can be
reduced easily to get free metal. Sulphide ores are converted into oxides by roasting.

 Refining is a process of converting impure metal into pure metal by different processes depending on the nature
of metals. It is a process of purification of metal.
 The substance which reacts with gangue to form a fusible mass which can easily be removed is known as flux, e.g.,
CaO, (Calcium oxide) is used as flux so as to remove SiO2 (Silica) as gangue.
 The fusible mass formed by the reaction of flux and gangue is known as slag. Slag is lighter than molten metal,
hence floats over molten metal and can be easily removed. It prevents metal from oxidation.

Ans. (i) Metals conduct electricity because they have
electrons which are free to move. They offer little
resistance to the flow of current. Silver and copper
are the best conductors of electricity.
(ii) Reaction of metals with nitric acid does not evolve
hydrogen gas. It is because HNO3 is a strong
oxidising agent. It oxidises H2 to produce water and
itself gets reduced to any of its oxides such as N2O,
NO or NO2.
(iii) Pure gold is 24 carat and is very soft. Therefore, it is
not suitable for making jewellery. It is alloyed with
Cu or Ag to make it hard. Generally, 22 carat gold
is used for making ornaments, which contains 22
parts of pure gold and 2 parts of either Cu or Ag. 3

Q. 19. You are given samples of three metals : Sodium,
magnesium and copper. Suggest any two
activities to arrange them in order to their
decreasing reactivity.
[Board Term-I, Set-NS9SX1D, 2016]
Ans. Different metals react with oxygen at different rates.

e.g., Sodium (Na) and potassium (K) catch fire, if left
in open. Hence, these are the most reactive metals.
To prevent accidental fires, these metals are kept
immersed in kerosene oil. Magnesium burns in air
only by heating. So, it is less reactive than sodium
and potassium. Copper (Cu) does not burn on
heating but blister copper burns. Hence the order
of reactivity of these metals with oxygen is :
Na > Mg > Cu.
Metals react with water to produce a metal oxide
and hydrogen gas. Sodium (Na) and potassium
(K) react violently with cold water. So the reaction
is violent and exothermic. Magnesium (Mg) does
not react with cold water. It reacts with hot water.
Metals like lead, copper, silver do not react with
water at all. The reactivity series of metals towards
water is :
		
Na > Mg > Cu.

Q. 1. What are ionic compounds ? List two properties

of these compounds.
[DDE-2014, 17]
Ans. The compounds which have bonds formed by loss
and gain of electrons are called ionic compounds
or electrovalent compound and the bond formed is
known as ionic bond or electrovalent bond.
Two properties of ionic compounds :
(i) Ionic compounds are hard and brittle.
(ii) Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling
points.
1+½+½
Q. 2. Why do ionic compounds have high melting
points ? State reason.
[Board Term-I, Set (18) 2012]

Ans. In ionic compounds, cations and anions are held
together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction.
Hence large amount of energy is required to
overcome these forces.

Q. 4. Define ionic compounds. Ionic compounds
conduct electricity only in the molten state and
not in solid state. Why ?
[Board Term-I, Set (38) 2012]
Ans. The compounds formed by the transfer of
electrons from a metal to a non-metal are called
ionic compounds.
1
Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct
electricity because movement of ions in the solid is
not possible due to their rigid structure, but in the
molten state ions move freely.

(2 marks each)

Q. 7. Why electrical wires are coated with PVC (Poly

Vinyl Chloride) ?
[DDE 2017]
Ans. Electric wires and cables are coated with substance
like PVC to prevent from electric shock since PVC is
insulator (bad conductor of electricity). and it does
not conduct electricity it is therefore on excellent
material to use for electrical applications such as
insulation sheathing for cables.
2

Q. 8. Why do we apply oil on iron hook kept in

storage ?
[DDE 2017]
Ans. Oils help to prevent corrosion by excluding moisture
and oxygen from the metal surface. All metals will
form a thin layer of oxide on the surface and oil etc.
can penetrate into this, helping to stabilise it and
prevent destructive corrosion.
2

Q. 9. Why should the metal sulphides and carbonates

be converted to metal oxides in the process of
extraction of metal from them ?

[NCERT Exemplar 2017]
Ans. It is easier to obtain metals from their oxides rather
than from carbonates or sulphides. So, the ore is
first converted into an oxide. A carbonate ore is first
converted into oxide ore by calcination. A Sulphide
ore is converted into oxide ore by roasting.

Q. 1. Define (i) mineral (ii) ore.

Aluminium occurs in combined state whereas
gold is found in free state in nature. Why ?

[Board Term-I, Set (36) 2012]
Ans. The elements or compounds which occur naturally
in the earth’s crust are known as minerals.
1
The mineral from which a particular metal can be

(3 marks each)

Ans. Electrolytic Refining : This method is widely used
as purification of metals like zinc (Zn), copper
(Cu), aluminium (Al), chromium (Cr), tin (Sn),
lead (Pb), nickel (Ni) and gold (Au). In this process,
impure metal is used as anode, a strip of pure metal
is used as cathode and soluble salt of metal is used
as electrolyte. On passing electric current through
the electrolyte, cations move towards cathode, gain
electrons and pure metal gets deposited on cathode.
In electrolytic refining of copper, the impurities
left behind at anode called anode mud contains
valuable metals such as gold and silver which can
be recovered in the native state.

(iii) Tarnished copper vessels are cleaned. [NCT-2014]
Ans. (i) Na, K, Li etc. are very reactive so these metals
react vigorously with atmospheric oxygen to form
oxides. Storing them in oil prevents their oxidation.
(ii) Platinum, gold and silver are least reactive, so they
are not corroded by air and water easily.
(iii) Copper vessels get tarnished by reacting with air
and water, due to which a layer is formed mainly
contains black copper oxide and green copper
hydroxide which is basic in nature. The citric acid
in lemon dissolves this layer and washes off easily.

Q. 4. An alkali metal A gives a compound B (Molecular
mass = 40) on reacting with water. The compound
B gives a soluble compound C on treatment with
aluminium oxide. Identify A, B and C and give the
reactions involved.
[NCERT Exemplar] 3

Ans. Let the atomic weight of alkali metal A be x. When
it reacts with water, it forms a compound B having
molecular mass 40. Let the reaction be.
		
2A + 2H2O → 2AOH + H2 ↑
		
(B)
According to the question,
		
x + 16 + 1 = 40
		
x = 40 – 17
∴
x = 23
[23 is the atomic weight of sodium (Na)]
Therefore, the alkali metal (A) is Na and the reaction
is —
2Na + 2H2O → 2NaOH(aq) + H2 (g)
So, compound B is sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
Sodium hydroxide reacts with aluminium oxide
(Al2O3) to give sodium aluminate (NaAlO2). Thus,
C is sodium aluminate (NaAlO2).
The reaction involved is —
Al2O3 + 2NaOH → 2NaAlO2 + H2O 1 + 1 + 1
Q. 5. P, Q and R are 3 elements which undergo chemical
reactions according to the following equations —
(a) P2O3 + 2Q → Q2O3 + 2P
(b) 3RSO4 + 2Q → Q2 (SO4)3 + 3R
(c) 3RO + 2P → P2O3 + 3R

Value Based Questions
Q. 1. A lady bought a new iron container and kept
blue vitriol solution into it. On the next day, she
found that the container becomes porous and the
blue colour of the solution fades. She goes to the
shopkeeper and complained. But the shopkeeper
argued that the container is of good quality and
will not give her money back. An aware person
Mohan came there and asked the matter and told
that the container is of good quality and you have
kept the wrong substance in it, so fault is all yours.
On the basis of the above passage, answer the
following questions :
(i) Why the container becomes porous when blue
vitriol solution is kept into it ?
(ii) What qualities are exhibited by Mohan ?
3
Ans. (i) Because iron being more reactive displaces
copper from copper sulphate solution by itself and
form green coloured ferrous sulphate.
(ii) Qualities exhibited by Mohan are–scientific
knowledge, awareness, helpfulness etc.

Q. 2. Gold is a very precious metal. Pure gold is very
soft and it is therefore not suitable for making
jewellery. It is alloyed with either silver or copper
to make it hard. But sometimes jewellers mix a
large quantity of copper and silver in gold to earn
more profit.
(i) What precautions should you take while
purchasing the gold jewellery ?
(ii) Why does Government insist on purchasing Hall
Marked jewellery ?
3
Ans. (i) We should always purchase the gold jewellery
from a branded shop with proper receipt and Hall
Marked certificate.

Q. 3. One day Madhu visited an aluminium industry
with her father. She found that molten alumina
was taken in the fused state for electrolytic
reduction process. She asked her father the reason
for using fused alumina as an electrolyte instead of
the solution of aluminium salt, although the latter
can save ample amount of energy. Madhu’s father
was pleased with her why nothing could be done
about that wastage of energy in that particular
instance. What could be his explanation ? What
values you infer from this passage ?
3
Ans. Aluminium cannot be prepared from its salt
solution because of its highly electropositive nature.
It does not get discharged at the cathode. H2 gas is
liberated at the cathode when a solution of a salt of
aluminium is electrolysed.

Values inferred from this passage are scientific
temperament, awareness, environmental concern
and knowledge.

Q. 4. Shashi bought new silver anklets. After a month,
she found that the anklets turn black. She has
doubt that it is not of pure silver but her neighbour
Rakhi told her that it is of pure silver and advised
her to wash it with tamarind or lemon juice to get
the lustre back. She followed the advise and get
the lustre of her anklets back.
Answer the following questions based on the
above passage.
(i) Why anklets turn black after some time ?
(ii) Why the anklets become lustrous on washing with
tamarind or lemon juice ?
(iii) What values are exhibited by Rakhi ?
3
Ans. (i) Anklets turned black due to the reaction of
silver with atmospheric H2S, which results in the
formation of black coloured silver sulphide (Ag2S).

[ 67

		 How carbon attain noble gas configuration ?
		
(i) Carbon is tetravalent, it does not form ionic bond by either losing four electrons (C4+) or by gaining four
electrons (C4–). It is because, it is difficult to hold four extra electron and would require large amount of energy
to remove four electrons. So, carbon can form bond by sharing of its electron with the electrons. of other
carbon atom or with other element and attain noble gas configuration.
		
(ii) The atoms of other elements like hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, chlorine also form bonds by sharing of
electrons.
		
(iii) The bond formed by sharing of electrons between same or different atoms is covalent bond.
 Covalent Bond : A covalent bond is formed by sharing of electrons between atoms. In a covalent bond, the shared
pair of electrons belongs to the valence shell of both the atoms.
 Carbon forms covalent bonds.
 Conditions for Formation of a Covalent Bond :
		 (i) The combining atoms should have 4 to 7 electrons in their valence shell.
		 (ii) The combining atoms should not lose electrons easily.
		 (iii) The combining atoms should gain electrons readily.

—

 Catenation : The self linking property of carbon atoms through covalent bonds to form long chains and rings is
called catenation.
 Tetravalency : Tetravalency is the state of an atom in which there are four electrons available with the atom for
covalent chemical bonding. Carbon has a valency of four. So, it is capable of making bonds with four other atoms
of carbon or any other element.
 Electronegativity : It is the ability of an atom to attract a shared pairs of electrons towards itself.
		 If the atoms forming a covalent bond have different electronegativities, the atom with higher electronegativity
pulls the shared pair of electrons towards itself. Thus, the atom with the higher electronegativity develops a
partial negative charge and the atom with the lower electronegative develops a partial positive charge. This bond
with some polarity is called polar covalent bond.
 Isomerism : The compounds which possess the same molecular formula but different structural formulae, are
called isomers, and the phenomenon is known as isomerism. For example, butane with a molecular formula C4H10
has two isomers.
CH3 — CH2 — CH2 — CH3
CH3 — CH — CH3
n-butane
CH3
		
			
Iso-butane
 Homologous Series : It is a family of organic compounds having the same functional group in which the formulae
of successive members differ by – CH2 group. For example, CH4, C2H6, C3H8, C4H10 etc. All the members of a
homologous series have similar structures and same chemical properties.
 Oxidation : Oxidation means controlled combustion. For example, when ethanol is heated with alkaline potassium
permanganate solution or acidified potassium dichromate solution, it gets oxidised to ethanoic acid.

carboxylic acid. This reaction is known as saponification because it is used in the preparation of soap.

CH3COOC2H5 NaOH

→ CH3COOH + C2H5OH.
					
 Soaps and Detergents : Soaps are sodium and potassium salts of long chain (higher) fatty acids such as stearic
acid, palmitic acid etc. Detergents are ammonium or sulphonate salts of long chain hydrocarbons.

Q. 9. Explain why carbon forms compounds mainly

by covalent bonds. Explain in brief two main
reasons for carbon forming a large number of

bonds with most other elements ?
[Board Term II, Delhi Set-I, 2015]
OR
What are the two properties of carbon which
lead to the huge number of carbon compounds
we see around us ?

Ans. (i) Carbon has 4 electrons in its outermost shell,
and needs to gain or lose 4 electrons to attain noble
gas configuration.
1

(ii) Losing or gaining 4 electrons is not possible due to

energy considerations; hence it shares electrons to
form covalent bonds.
1

Two reasons for large number of carbon
compounds :
(i) Catenation : The unique ability of carbon to form
bonds with other atoms of carbon, giving rise to
long chains of different types of compounds.
1
(ii) Tetravalency : Since carbon has a valency of 4,
it is capable of bonding with four other atoms
of carbon or atoms of elements like oxygen,
hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, chlorine, etc.
1
The reason for the formation of strong bonds by
carbon is its small size which enables the nucleus to
hold on to the shared pairs of electrons strongly. 1
		
[CBSE Marking Scheme, 2015]
Detailed Answer :
Since carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of
bonding with four other atoms of carbon or atoms
of some other monovalent elements. In order to
satisfy its tetravalency carbon can form double
or triple bonds also with other C-atoms or with
oxygen, nitrogen etc.
Reasons for carbon forming a large number of
compounds are :
(i) Catenation : Carbon has the unique property or
ability to form bonds with other atoms of carbon,
giving rise to large molecules. This property is
called catenation. These compounds may have long
chains of carbon, branched chains of carbon or even
carbon atoms arranged in rings.
(ii) Tetravalency : Carbon has four valence electrons
in its valence shell so the valency of carbon is four.
Due to this valency, carbon is a tetravalent element
and it has the capability of satisfying its tetravalent
by sharing its electrons with some monovalent
elements and forming covalent bonds.
(iii) Carbon exhibits catenation much more than any
other element due to its smaller size which makes
the C — C bonds strong while the bonds between
any other element are comparatively weaker due to
its large size.

compounds :
(i) Generally have low melting and boiling points.
(ii) Do not conduct electricity in molten state.
[Board Term-II, Outside Delhi Set-I, III, 2014]
Ans. Two of the main reasons because of which carbon
forms a large number of organic compounds are :
1. Tetravalent nature of carbon
2. Greater C–C bond strength
Carbon compounds are formed by covalent bonds.
(i) Carbon compounds have low melting and boiling
point because these compounds are bonded with
covalent bond and also forces of attraction between
these molecules are not very strong.

they are bad conductors of electricity; they lack free
electrons.

covalent compounds:
(i) are bad conductors of electricity.
(ii) have low melting and boiling points.
[Board Term-II, Delhi Set-I, III, 2014]
Ans. Atomic number of carbon is six. This means that it
has four electrons in its outermost shell and it needs

86 ]

Oswaal CBSE Question Bank, SCIENCE, Class – 10

four more electrons to attain noble gas electronic
configuration. It does not form C4+ cation, as the
removal of four valence electrons will require a
huge amount of energy. The cation formed will
have six protons and two electrons. This makes it
highly unstable. Carbon is unable to form C4– anion
as its nucleus with six protons will not be able to
hold ten electrons. Thus, carbon achieves noble
gas electronic configuration by sharing its four

electrons with other elements, i.e. it forms covalent
compounds.
(i) Covalent compounds are bad conductors of
electricity due to lack of free electrons.
(ii) Covalent compounds are formed by covalent bonds
and it has been found that the intermolecular forces
of attraction in covalent compounds are weak.
Thus, their melting and boiling points are quite
low.

Q. 24. What is the difference between the molecules of
soaps and detergents, chemically ? Explain the
cleansing action of soaps.
[Board Term II, Delhi Set I, 2015]
Ans. Detergents are sodium salt of long chain benzene
sulphonic acids.
Soaps are sodium or potassium salt of long chain
fatty acids that have cleaning action in water. e.g.,
Sodium stearate.
Cleansing Action of Soap : A soap molecule
consists of two dissimilar parts :
(i) A short ionic part comprising the carboxylate salt-COO–Na+ which is water soluble.
(ii) A long hydrocarbon chain which is hydrophobic.
When soap is dissolved in water, it forms a colloidal
suspension. In this colloidal suspension, the soap
molecules cluster together to form micelles and
remain radially suspended in water with the
hydrocarbon end towards the centre and the ionic
end directed outward. The dirt particles always
adhere to the oily or greasy layer present on the
skin or clothes. When a dirty cloth is dipped into
a soap solution, its non-polar hydrocarbon end of
micelles gets attached to the grease or oil present
in dirt and polar end remains in water layer.
The mechanical action of rubbing subsequently,
dislodges the oily layer from the dirty surface
shaping it into small globules. A stable emulsion
of oil in water is formed. The emulsified oil or
grease globules bearing the dirt can now be readily
washed with water.

[CBSE Marking Scheme, 2015]
Detailed Answer :
Electron dot structure of ethyne —
H C C H
No, the mixture of ethyne and air cannot be used
for welding because when ethyne is burnt in air,
it gives a sooty flame. This is due to incomplete
combustion caused by limited supply of air.
However, if ethyne is burnt with oxygen, it gives
a clean flame with temperature 3000°C because of
complete combustion. This oxy-acetylene flame is
used for welding. It is not possible to attain such a
high temperature without mixing oxygen.

Q. 2. What are micelles ? Why does it form when
soap is added to water ? Will a micelle be

formed in other solvents such as ethanol also ?
State briefly how the formation of micelles help

[Board Term II Foreign Set-III, 2016]
OR
Why does micelle formation takes place when
soap is added to water ? Will a micelle be
formed in other solvents such as ethanol also ?
[NCERT]
Ans. (i) Soap molecules have two ends– one end is
the hydrocarbon chain which is water repellent,
where as the other end is the ionic part which it
water soluble end. When soap is dissolved in water
it forms a group of many molecules, known as
micelle.
1
(ii) These micelles are formed because their
hydrocarbon chains come together and the polar
ends are projected outwards.
1
(iii) Micelle formation in ethanol will not occur because
the hydrocarbon chain end of the soap will dissolve
in ethanol.
1
(iv) Soaps in the form of micelle are able to clean dirty
clothes having oily spots, as the oily dirt is collected
in the centre of the micelle, which forms an
emulsion in water and on rinsing, the water washes
away the micelles with dirt attached to them.

Q. 3. Two compounds ‘A’ and ‘B’ have the same molecular
formula C3H6O2. One of them reacts with sodium
metal and NaHCO3 to liberate H2 gas and a gas ‘C’,
respectively. ‘C’ turns lime water milky. The other
compound does not react with either Na metal
or NaHCO3 but undergoes saponification to give
sodium salt of a carboxylic acid and wood spirit,
'D’. Identify A, B, C and D.
5
Ans. Two possible compounds with molecular formula
C3H6O2 are propanoic acid (CH3CH2COOH) and
methyl acetate (CH3COOCH3). Propanoic acid
reacts with Na metal to give sodium propanoate
and H2 gas and with NaHCO3, it gives CO2 gas
which turns lime water milky. Methyl acetate on
saponification gives sodium acetate and wood spirit
i.e., methanol.
3
Thus, A is propanoic acid

½

B is methyl acetate

½

C is carbon dioxide

½

D is methanol.

Q. 4. An organic compound ‘A’ with molecular formula
C2H6O gives compound ‘B’ on oxidation with

alkaline KMnO4. ‘A’ an heating with conc. H2SO4
gives ‘C’ which on reaction with phosphoric acid
and water gives back ‘A’. Compound ‘C’ gives
addition product with Br2 and H2. Identify A, B, C
and write chemical equations involved.
3
Ans. Since C gives addition reaction with Br2 and H2 and
so it is unsaturated hydrocarbon. It gives an alcohol
with phosphoric acid and water i.e., CH3CH2OH. So
C is ethene. Thus, A is ethanol which on oxidation
with alkaline KMnO4 gives ethanoic acid. So we can
conclude that A is ethanol, B is ethanoic acid and C
is ethene.

PERIODIC
CLASSIFICATION
OF ELEMENTS

Syllabus
 Periodic Classification : Need for classification, Early attempts at classification of elements (Dobereiner’s
Triads, Newlands Law of Octaves, Mendeleev’s Periodic Table), modern periodic table, Gradation in properties, valency, atomic number, metallic and non-metallic properties.

Quick Review
Need for Periodic Classification
		To make the study of these elements easy, these element have been divided
into few groups in such a way that elements in the same group have similar
properties. Now study of a large number of elements is reduced to a few groups
of elements.
		
Dobereiner’s Triads : When elements were arranged in the order of increasing
atomic masses, groups of three elements (known as triads), having similar
chemical properties are obtained.
The atomic mass of the middle element of the triad was roughly the average of
the atomic masses of the order two elements.

 Dobereiner could identify only three triads. He was not able to prepare triads of all the known elements.
 Newlands Law of Octaves : John Newlands arranged elements in order of increasing atomic mass.
		It states when elements are arranged in increasing order of atomic mass, the properties of the eighth element are a
kind of repetition of the first, just like notes of music.

PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS



[ 105

Limitations of Newlands law of octaves :
(i)

The law was applicable to elements up to calcium (Ca) only.

(ii)

It contained only 56 elements. Further it was assumed by Newlands that only 56 elements existed in nature
and no more elements would be discovered in the future.

(iii) In order to fit elements into the table, Newlands adjusted two elements in the same column as fluorine,
chlorine and bromine which have very different properties than these elements. Iron, which resemble cobalt
and nickel in properties, has been placed differently away from these elements.


Mendeleev’s Periodic Table : Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, was the most important contributor
to the early development of a periodic table of elements where in the elements were arranged on the basis of their
atomic mass and chemical properties.



Characteristics of Mendeleev’s Periodic Table :
(i)

Mendeleev arranged all the 63 known elements in increasing order of their atomic masses.

(ii)

The table consists of vertical columns called ‘groups’ and horizontal rows called ‘periods’.

(iii) The elements with similar physical and chemical properties came under same groups.


Mendeleev’s Periodic Law : The properties of elements are the periodic functions of their atomic masses.



Merits of Mendeleev’s Periodic Table
(i)

Mendeleev left some blank spaces for undiscovered elements.

(ii)

Mendeleev predicted the discovery of some elements and named them as eka-boron, eka aluminium and ekasilicon.

(iii) Noble gases discovered later could be placed without disturbing the existing order.


Limitations of Mendeleev’s periodic table :
(i)

Position of Hydrogen : Could not assign a correct position to hydrogen as hydrogen resembles alkali metals
as well as halogens.

(ii)

Position of Isotopes : Isotopes are places in same position though they have different atomic masses.

(iii) Separation of chemically similar elements while dissimilar elements are placed in the same group.


Modern Periodic Table : Henry Moseley gave a new property of elements, ‘atomic numbers’ and this was adopted
as the basis of Modern Periodic Table.



Modern Periodic Law : Properties of elements are the periodic functions of their atomic numbers.



Position of elements in modern periodic table :
(i)

The Modern Periodic Table consists of 18 groups and 7 periods.

(ii)

Elements present in any one group have the same number of valence electrons. Also, the number of shells
increases as we go down the group.

(iii) Elements present in any one period, contain the same number of shells. Also, with increase in atomic number
by one unit on moving from left to right, the valence shell electron increases by one unit.
(iv) Each period marks a new electronic shell getting filled.


Trends in the Modern Periodic Table :
(i)

Periodicity in Properties : The properties of elements depend upon the electronic configuration which
changes along a period and down a group in the periodic table. The periodicity properties i.e. repetition of
properties after a regular interval is due to similarity in electronic configuration.

(ii)

Tendency to lose or gain electron : Chemical reactivity of an element depends upon the ability of its atoms to
donate or accept electrons.

(iii) Variations of tendency to lose electron down the group : Tendency to lose electron goes on increasing down
the group.
		
Reason : It is due to the increase in the distance between the valence electrons and the nucleus as the atomic
size increases down the group, the force of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons decreases,
therefore, tendency to lose electron also increases down the group.
(iv) Variation of tendency to lose electron along a period : It goes on decreasing generally along a period from left
to right with decrease in atomic size.
		
Reason : Due to decrease in the atomic size, the force of attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus
increases and, therefore, electrons cannot be removed easily.
(v)

Variation of tendency to gain electron down the group : It goes on decreasing down the group in general.

		
Reason : Due to increase in atomic size, the force of attraction between the nucleus and the electron to be added
becomes less.

(vi) Variation of tendency to gain electron along a period : It increases left to right in a period.
		
Reason : It is due to decrease in the atomic size which leads to an increase in the force of attraction between the
nucleus and the electron to be added.

Know the Terms


Mendeleev’s Periodic Law : This law states that the properties of elements are the periodic function of their atomic
masses.



Anomalies in arrangement of elements based on increasing atomic mass could be removed when the elements were
arranged in order of increasing atomic number, a fundamental property of the element discovered by Moseley in
1913.



Modern Periodic Law : According to this law, the properties of elements are periodic function of their atomic
number.



The 18 vertical columns in modern periodic table are known as groups whereas 7 horizontal rows in modern
periodic table are called periods.



Periodicity : When the elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic numbers, elements with similar chemical
properties are repeated at definite intervals. This is known as periodicity.



Atomic Radius : Atomic radius is defined as the distance from the centre of the nucleus of an atom to the outermost
shell of electrons.



Covalent Radii : It is defined as half of the distance between the centre of nuclei of two atoms (bond length) bonded
by a single covalent bond e.g., bond length in case of H—H is 74 pm.

		
Covalent radius : ½ × 74 = 37 pm
		It can be measured in case of diatomic molecules of non-metals.


Metallic Radii : It is defined as half of the internuclear distance between the two metal ions in a metallic
crystal.



Metalloids : Those elements which resemble both metals and non-metals are called metalloids. They are also called
semi-metals. e.g., Boron, Silicon, Germanium, Arsenic, Antimony, Tellurium and Polonium.



Isotopes : Elements which have same atomic number but different mass number are called isotopes.

arrange all the elements in the form of triads having
similar chemical properties. Dobereiner could
identify only three triads from the elements known
at that time.

Q. 4. Why He, Ne and Ar are called inert gases ?
[DDE 2017]
Ans. He, Ne and Ar are called inert gases because their
outermost shell is complete and they do not lose or
gain electrons in their outermost shell, hence they
have zero valency.

Q. 5. State the modern periodic law for classification
of elements. How many (a) groups and (b)
periods are there in the modern periodic
table ?
[Delhi 31/1/1, 2017]
[Board Term II, Delhi 2012]
Ans.“Properties of elements are the periodic function of
their atomic number.”
(i) There are 18 groups.
(ii) There are 7 periods in the modern periodic table.
[CBSE Marking Scheme, 2012] 1 + ½ + ½
Q. 6. State two main properties of elements on which

Mendeleev’s periodic classification was based.
Why position of hydrogen is not fixed in his
periodic table ?
[Board Term II, (Set C-2009), 2012]
Ans. (i) Physical properties of elements are periodic
function of their atomic masses.
(ii) Similar formula of oxides and hydrides formed by
elements of same group was selected as chemical
property as basis of classification.

110 ]
The atomic number of hydrogen is 1 and hence it
should occupy the first position in group 1 of the
periodic table. But because of its chemical similarity
with elements of group 1 and 17, the position of
hydrogen in the periodic is not fixed.
2
Q. 7. How does the electronic configuration of an
atom of an element relate to its position in
the modern periodic table ? Explain with one
example.
[Board Term II, Delhi 2012]
Ans. The position of elements depends upon number of
valence electrons which depend upon electronic
configuration. Those elements which have same
valence electrons, occupy same group.
Those elements which have one valence electron
belong to group 1.
1
Elements which have two valence electrons belong
to group 2.
Period number is equal to the number of shells.
Example : Atomic number of sodium (Na) is 11, so
electronic configuration will be 2, 8, 1. Sodium has
one valence electron in valence shell so it belongs to
group 1. As sodium has three shells, so it belongs to
3rd period.
Q. 8. Why is the position assigning to hydrogen in
the periodic table considered anomalous ?
[DDE 2017]

Oswaal CBSE Question Bank, SCIENCE, Class – 10

Ans. Electronic configuration of Hydrogen resembles
that of alkali metals. Like alkali metals, hydrogen
combines with halogens, oxygen and sulphur to
form compounds having similar formulae. On the
other hand, just like halogens, hydrogen also exists
as diatomic molecules and it combines with metals
and non-metals to form covalent compounds. So,
no fixed position can be given to hydrogen in the
Periodic Table.

Q. 6. Give an account of the process adopted by
Mendeleev for the classification of elements.
How did he arrive at “Periodic Law” ?
[NCERT Exemplar]
Ans. (i) When Mendeleev started his work, 63 elements
were known. He studied the compounds of these
elements with oxygen and hydrogen. He selected
hydrogen and oxygen as they are very reactive
and formed compounds with most elements. The
formulae of the hydrides and oxides formed by an
element were treated as one of the basic properties
of an element for its classification.
(ii) Elements with similar properties were arranged in a
group.
(iii) Mendeleev observed that elements were
automatically arranged in the order of increasing
atomic masses.

Q. 7. How does the tendency of the elements to lose
electrons change in the Modern Periodic Table
in (i) a group, (ii) a period and why ?

[Board Term II, Foreign Set III, 2016]
Ans. (i) Increases down a group.
½
Reason : At each succeeding element down a group
the number of shells increases, so the distance of
the valence shell from the nucleus increases, the
effective nuclear force of attraction decreases on
the last shell, so it becomes easy for the atom to

Q. 18. How could the Modern Periodic Table remove
various anomalies of Mendeleev’s Periodic
Table?
Ans. Modification in Mendeleev’s Periodic Table :
With the adoption of atomic number as the basis of
classification of elements, some of the anomalies in
the Mendeleev’s Periodic Table now disappeared.
These are :
(i) Position of Hydrogen : The atomic number of
hydrogen is 1 and hence, it should occupy the
first position in group 1 of the periodic Table. But
because of its chemical similarity with elements of
group 1 and group 17, the position of hydrogen in
the periodic table is still not confirmed.
(ii) Position of Isotopes : As the isotopes of an element
have the same atomic number, they should occupy
the same place in the periodic table.
(iii) Position of Anomalous Pairs : The position of
anomalous pairs of elements i.e., pairs of elements
in which the element with the higher atomic mass
proceeds the element with lower atomic mass, is
also decided. When these elements are arranged
according to their atomic number, they occupy
their right places in the periodic table.

[CBSE Marking Scheme, 2017] 1+1
Detailed Answer :
(i) On moving across a period, nuclear pull increases
due to the increases in atomic number and thus
the atomic size decreases. Hence, elements cannot
lose electrons easily. The metallic nature decreases
across a period, moving from left to right.
(ii) On moving down a group, the atomic size increases
and the nuclear charge also increases. The effect of
an increased atomic size is greater as compared to
the increased nuclear charge. Therefore, metallic
nature increases as one moves down a group.

Short Answer Type Questions-II
Q. 1. What is meant by atomic radius ? Explain why it

decreases across a period ?
[Board Term II, Set-GFUTB86, 2015]

Ans. The distance from centre of nucleus to outermost
shell of an atom is atomic radius.
Atomic radius decreases across a period because
electron is added in the same shell. So attraction
between nucleus and valence shell increases due
to which outermost shell is pulled in closer to the
nucleus.
[CBSE Marking scheme, 2015] 1 + 2

Ans. (i) Atomic radius decreases
½
Reason : Nuclear charge increases which tends to
pull the electrons closer to the nucleus.

Q. 3.

Write the names given to the vertical columns

Table. How does the metallic character of
elements vary on moving down a vertical
column ? How does the size of atomic radius
vary on moving left to right in a horizontal row
? Give reason in support of your answer in the
above two cases.
[Delhi 31/1/1 2017]

Ans. Vertical Column — Groups
½
Horizontal Rows — Period
½
Metallic character increases
Reason : Ability to lose electrons increases on
moving down the group due to increases in
distance between the nucleus and the valence
electrons/decrease in the attraction between the
nucleus and the valence electrons.
½
Atomic radius decreases

(3 marks each)

Reason : The nuclear charge increases on moving
from left to right across a period resulting in
increase in the attraction between the nucleus and
the valence electrons.
[CBSE Marking Scheme, 2017]
Detailed Answer :
In the modern periodic table, there are 18 vertical
columns known as Groups and 7 horizontal rows
known as Periods.
Metallic character increases on moving down a
group in the Modern Periodic table. As we move
down the group, the electrostatic attraction
between the nucleus and the outermost electron
decreases due to increase in the distance between
them. This happens because; on moving down the
group a new shell a added. So, the valence electron
can be easily lost by the element, thereby metallic
character increases on moving down a group.
The size of atomic radius decreases on moving
left of right in a horizontal row. When, we move
across a period, the number of electrons in the same
shell increases. This leads to greater electrostatic
attraction between the nucleus and the outermost
electron. This increased attraction pulls the
outermost electron closer to the nucleus, thereby
decreasing the atomic size.

answer stating reason for each case.
[Board Term II, Delhi II, 2015]

Ans. (i) Na/Sodium.
Reason : The atomic size decreases from left to

(ii) Al/Aluminium.
Reason : The tendency to lose electrons decreases
from left to right.
[CBSE Marking Scheme, 2015] 1½ + 1½
Detailed Answer :
(i) Na will have the largest atomic radius as atomic size
goes on decreasing along a period from left to right.
It is due to increase in nuclear charge (number
of protons in nucleus) which pulls the electrons
towards it, i.e., force of attraction between nucleus
and valence electrons increases, therefore atomic
size decreases.
(ii) Al is least reactive because reactivity of an element
depends upon the ability of its atoms to donate or
accept electrons. Tendency to lose electrons along a
period generally decreases with decrease in atomic
size, i.e., the force of attraction between the valence
electrons and the nucleus increases, therefore
electrons cannot be removed easily.

Q. 45. Write the number of period the modern periodic
table has. How do the valency and metallic
character of elements vary on moving from left
to right in a period ? How do the valency and
atomic size of elements vary down a group ?
[Board Term II, Delhi Set I, 2013]
Ans. There are 7 horizontal rows known as periods, that
the modern periodic table has.
In periods, the number of valence electrons
increases from left to right and due to decrease
in atomic size, the force of attraction between
the valence electrons and the nucleus increases.
Metallic character decreases along the period due
to decrease in tendency to lose electrons.
Atomic size generally increases from top to bottom
in a group due to the addition of a new shell i.e.,
number of shells goes on increasing down the
group.

High Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) Questions
Q. 1. How do the early attempts to classify the chemical
elements differ from the modern attempt ? Which
of the two is better and why ? Give examples.
3
Ans. The early attempts to classify elements were made on
the basis of atomic masses of the elements. Modern
basis is the atomic number. This is better because
now it is established that atomic number of an
element is the fundamental property. Further there
are certain anomalies in Mendeleev’s periodic table
such as the position of isotopes and misplacements
of certain elements, e.g. Argon is placed (Atomic
mass - 40, atomic number = 18) before potassium
in Mendeleev’s periodic table (Atomic mass = 39,
At. no = 19).
3
Q. 2. What are metalloids ? How many electrons can
be present in the valency shell of their atoms ? In
what part of the periodic table these are located ?
What type of oxide are formed by these elements ?
3
Ans. Metalloids are elements which resemble both metals
and non-metals. The valency shell of metalloids
contain 3, 4, 5, 6 elements starting from periods 2 to
5 respectively. They are found on the right side of
the table in the zig-zag column, e.g., boron, silicon,
germanium, arsenic etc. They form amphoteric
oxides.
3
Q. 3. What is electronegativity ? How it is different from
electron affinity ?
3
Ans. Though both electronegativity and electron affinity
refer to the attraction of electron but are used in
different context. Electronegativity refers to the
attraction of bonding electron or shared pair of
electron whereas electron affinity refers to the
attraction of electron by an isolated gaseous atoms.
3

filled from group 1 to group 18 and the shell does
not change.

Q. 4. What is the basic difference between a group and a
period in terms of electronic configuration ?
3


Ans. In a group, though the number of shells increases as
we move downward, but the number of electrons
in the outermost shell remains the same.

In a period, as we move from left to right, the
outermost shell or valence shell gets progressively

 	
1½ + 1½
Q. 5. An element ‘X’ is liquid, non-metallic. Can you
predict its position in the periodic table ?
3
Ans. As the element ‘X’ is non-metallic, it may be
belonging to group 17. In group 17, first two
elements are gases. Metallic character of elements
(non-metals) increases on moving down the group.
Therefore, the element ‘X’ may be located in group
17 and 3rd or 4th period of the periodic table.

State four inference that can be drawn about the
elements on the basis of the above data.
5
Ans. (i) Since each element contains the same number of
valence electrons, n in the outermost shells of their
atoms, therefore X, Y and Z, belong to the same
group.
2
(ii) The atomic radii increase from X to Z so metallic
character increases from X towards Z.
1
(iii) X, Y and Z have melting points above 25°C (room
temperature). Therefore X, Y and Z are solid at
room temperature.

(iv) The ionization potential decreases from X to Z
because they belong to the same group in the
descending order.

Energy required to carry out the different life processes, is
obtained from carbon-based food sources through nutrition.
 Depending on the mode of obtaining nutrition, organisms are classified as autotrophs or heterotrophs.
		 (i) Autotrophs can prepare their own food from simple inorganic sources like carbon dioxide and water. (e.g.,
green plants, some bacteria).
		 (ii) Heterotrophs cannot synthesise their own food and is dependent on the autotrophs for obtaining complex
organic substance for nutrition. (e.g., animals)
 Green plants prepare their food by the process of photosynthesis. Here, they utilise CO2, H2O and sunlight,
with the help of chlorophyll, giving out O2 as a by product.
 In the light reaction of photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed and converted to chemical energy in the form
of ATP. Also water molecules split into hydrogen and oxygen.
 Carbon dioxide is reduced to carbohydrates in the dark phase of photosynthesis.
 Plants carry out gaseous exchange with surrounding through stomata.
 In humans, digestion of food takes place in the alimentary canal, made up of various organs and glands.
 Liver secretes bile which emulsifies fat.

 Plants release CO2 at night and oxygen during the day.
 In humans, air takes the following path on entering the nostrils.
		
Nostrils → Nasal passage → Pharynx → Larynx → Trachea → Bronchus → Bronchiole → Alveolus.
 The alveoli of lungs are richly supplied with blood and are the sites where exchange of gases (O2 and CO2) occurs
between blood and atmosphere.
 In humans, the respiratory pigment haemoglobin, carry oxygen from lungs to different tissues of the body.
 Human heart has 4 chambers -2 atria (right and left) and 2 ventricles (right and left). Right half of the heart
receives deoxygenated blood whereas the left half receives oxygenated blood.
 Arteries carry blood from heart to different parts of the body whereas veins deliver the blood back to the heart.
Arteries are connected to veins by thin capillaries, where materials are exchanged between blood and cells.
 Blood platelets are essential for clotting of blood at the place of injury and thus preventing blood loss.
 Lymphatic system consists of lymph, lymph nodes, lymphatic capillaries and lymph vessels which drain into
larger veins. Lymph is also important in the process of transportation.
Double circulation
 Blood travels twice through the heart in one complete cycle of the body.
 Pulmonary Circulation : Blood moves from the heart to the lungs and back to the heart.
 Systemic Circulation : Blood moves from the heart to rest of the body and back to the heart.

Transportation in plants
			 There are two main conducting pathways in plant.
Xylem
1.

Carries water & minerals from the
roots to other parts of the plant.

Phloem
1.

Carries product of photosynthesis from leaves to the
other parts of the plant.

2. No energy is used.
2.
Energy is used from ATP.
Transpiration : is the process of loss of water as vapour from aerial parts of the plant.
 During excretion, the harmful metabolic nitrogenous wastes generated are removed from the body.
 Nephrons are the basic filtration units of kidneys. They carry out filtration, selective reabsorption and tubular
secretion to from urine in kidney, which is then passed out through the urethra, via the ureters and urinary
bladder.
Formation of Urine
 Each kidney contains many filtration units called as nephrons.
 Nephrons are made up of a cluster of thin walled capillaries called as glomerulus which is associated with a cup
like structure called as Bowman's capsule and the long tube which terminates through this capsule.
 The renal artery brings oxygenated blood to the kidneys along with the nitrogenous wastes like urea and uric acid
and many other substances.
 The blood gets filtered through the glomerulus and this filtrate enters the tubular part of nephron.
 As this filtrate moves down the tubular part, glucose, amino acids, salts and excess of water gets selectively
reabsorded by the blood vessels surrounding tubules.
 The amount of water reabsorded depends upon :
		 * How much excess of water is there in the body and,
		 * How much nitrogenous wastes need to be excreted out.
 So the fluid now flowing in the tubular part is urine which gets collected in collecting ducts of nephrons.
 These collecting ducts together leave the kidney at a common point by forming the ureter.
 Each ureter drains the urine in the urinary bladder where it is stored until the pressure of expanded bladder leads
to an urge to pass it out through urethra.
 This bladder is a muscular structure which is under nervous control.
 180 litres of filtrate is formed daily but only 2 litres is excreted out as urine so the rest is reabsorbed in the body.

respiration. Muscle cells break down glucose to
produce lactic acid and energy. A lot of lactic acid
gets accumulated in our muscles and this causes
muscle cramps.
2
Q. 4. How are the alveoli designed to maximise the
exchange of gases?
[NCERT 2017]
Ans. The alveoli are adapted to make gas exchange in
lungs efficiently. They give the lungs a really big
surface area, they have moist, thin walls and they
have a lot of tiny blood vessels called Capillaries.
Air is sucked into the lungs and alveoli. When we
breathe in the alveoli expand, and maximise the
exchange of gases.
2
Q. 5. What is the benefit of residual volume of air in
the respiratory process?
[DDE 2017]
Ans. It prevents our lungs to get burst out. It also prevent
sticking of lung walls and provide nourishment to
inner lungs during exhalation.

Q. 7. When a sportsman runs, he often gets muscle
cramps. Why ?
[Board Term I, Set-44, 2011]
Ans. In order to release more energy to perform sudden
activity, pyruvate is converted into lactic acid in the
lack of oxygen. Formation of lactic acid in muscles
cause cramps or fatigue.

Q. 8. Stomata of desert plants remain closed during
day time. How do they take up CO2 and perform
photosynthesis ?

[Board Term I, Set (11), 2012; Set (C2) 2010]

Ans. Desert plants take up CO2 at night and prepare an
intermediate molecule. The intermediate molecule
is acted upon by the energy and absorbed by the
chlorophyll during day.
1+1
Q. 9. How do guard cells regulate opening and
closing of stomatal pores ?

[Board Term I, Set (C1), 2010]
Ans. The swelling of guard cells due to absorption of
water causes opening of stomatal pores while
shrinking of guard cell closes the pores. Opening
and closing of stomata occur due to turgor changes
in guard cells. When guard cells are turgid, stomatal
pores is open while in flaccid conditions the
stomatal aperture closes.

long ? Give reasons for your answer.

[Board Term I, Set (35) 2011; 2010]
[NCERT Exemplar 2017]
Ans. This plant will not remain healthy for a long time
because :
(i) It will not get oxygen for respiration.
(ii) It will not get carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.
(iii) Upward movement of water and minerals would
be hampered due to lack of transpiration.


[Board Term I, Set-23, 2011]
Ans. (i) All the cells in multicellular organisms may
not be in direct contact with the surrounding
environment. Thus, simple diffusion will not
meet the O2 requirements of all the cells.

Short Answer Type Questions-II
Q. 1. Define breathing. Explain the mechanism of

breathing in human beings.
[Board Term I, Set-WDCXXOV, 2016]

Ans. Breathing is the process of letting in oxygen from
air into the lungs and CO2 out of the lungs.
Mechanism : Involuntary, rate controlled by
brain. Outward and inward movement of ribs
increases or decreases the space of thoracic
cavity, action assisted by diaphragm continuous
inhalation and exhalation of the air.
[CBSE Marking Scheme, 2016]

(3 marks each)

Detailed Answer : A physical process by which
oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is given out
is called breathing.
Breathing in humans involves three steps :
(i) Inspiration : When we breathe in, ribs move up
and flatten the diaphragm due to which the chest
cavity becomes larger. As a result air is sucked into
the lungs and fills the expanded alveoli.
(ii) Gaseous exchange : Haemoglobin binds with
the oxygen and carries it along the blood in the
body. As blood passes through the tissues of the
body, oxygen from the blood diffuses into the cell,
whereas carbon dioxide which is produced during

142 ]

Oswaal CBSE Question Bank, SCIENCE, Class – 10

respiration diffuses into the blood and is carried to
the lungs for expiration.
(iii) Expiration : Ribs move down and diaphragm
becomes dome-shaped decreasing the chest cavity.
Thus, pushing the air out from lungs.

the breakdown of pyruvate into lactic acid that

2+1
Q. 6. How is carbon dioxide and oxygen transported
in human being ?
[NCERT]
Ans. When we inhale air, oxygen reaches the alveoli
in lungs. Thin capillaries surround alveoli. These
alveoli carry blood in them. The oxygen diffuses
from the alveoli walls to the blood in capillaries. This
blood travel all through the body. Haemoglobin
binds with oxygen and carry it along the body. The
O2 is present in the blood diffuses into the cells since
the blood contain high concentration of oxygen
while cells contain low concentration of oxygen.
CO2 is produced as a waste product in respiration
in the cells of tissues. This CO2 diffuses into the
blood as the concentration of CO2 is low in blood.
Blood carries CO2 back to lungs, where it diffuses
into alveoli, then trachea, nostrils and then out of
the body into air. CO2 is transported in dissolved
form in our blood.

Q. 7. The rate of breathing in aquatic organisms
is much faster than that seen in terrestrial
organisms. Give reason.

[Board Term I, Set-5X7289R, 2014] [DDE 2017]

[ 143

LIFE PROCESSES

Ans. A terrestrial organism can obtain oxygen directly
from the air and have slow breathing rate but
aquatic organisms have to obtain oxygen for
respiration which is dissolved in water. Since, the
amount of oxygen dissolved in water is fairly low as
compared to the amount of oxygen in air the rate of
breathing in aquatic organism is much faster.

[NCERT Exemplar 2017] [NCERT]

[ 147

LIFE PROCESSES

Ans. Double circulation has two components—
Pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation.
Pulmonary circulation is movement of blood from
heart to the lungs and back from the lungs to the
heart. Deoxygenated blood of the body enters
the right auricle, passes into right ventricle which
pumps it into pulmonary arch, two separate
pulmonary arteries the blood passes into the lungs.
Now Oxygenated blood from the lungs is carried
block to the heart by : Pulmonary veins and
enters into the left auricle of the heart Systemic
Circulation is the circulation of blood between
heart and different parts of the body except lungs.
Oxygenated blood received by left auricle passes
into left ventricle. The left ventricle pumps it into
aorta for supply to different body parts including
walls of the heart with the help of arteries. ½ + ½
Q. 9. What would be the consequences of a deficiency

of haemoglobin in our bodies ?

[NCERT]

Ans. Haemoglobin efficiently binds with oxygen and
then it transports oxygen to various parts of
body. Deficiency of haemoglobin is referred to as
anaemia. In such a condition, the blood is unable
to carry the sufficient amount of oxygen required
by the body. This would cause less respiration and
less energy will be liberated. In anaemia, the person
feels weak, pale, lethargic and unable to perform
heavy physical work.

Q. 4. Artificial kidney is a device to remove
nitrogenous waste products from the blood
through dialysis. In case of kidney failure, an
artificial kidney can be used. Dialysis is the
procedure used in artificial kidney to replace

a non-functional or damaged kidney. In the
process, blood of the patient is allowed to pass
through the long cellulose tubes dipped in
a tank containing dialysing solution having
same ionic concentration as plasma. The waste
substances diffuse out of blood into the tank
and the cleansed blood is returned back into the
patient through a vein.

High Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) Questions
Q. 1. In human, digestion starts in mouth. Which
component of food breaks down in mouth ? What
is the reason behind it ?
3
Ans. Starch breaks down in mouth, salivary glands
present in the mouth secrete saliva. Saliva contains
an enzyme called salivary amylase that breaks
down starch to give sugar (maltose).
3
Q. 2. Energy and food material are also required
by plants. From where do plants fulfill these
requirements ?
3
Ans. Plants obtain energy and food material from
inorganic sources in the form of carbon dioxide
and water by the process of photosynthesis. During
the process of photosynthesis, green plants take in
carbon dioxide and water and convert them into
carbohydrates and oxygen in the presence of light
and chlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for
providing energy to the plant.
3
Q. 3. In a croton leaf, which areas of the leaf contains
starch, green or yellow ? Give the reason for your
answer.
3
Ans. Green areas of croton leaf contain starch. Starch is
formed during the process of photosynthesis which
takes place in the presence of chlorophyll. Yellow
areas of croton leaf do not contain chlorophyll
hence unable to form starch. Green areas contain
chlorophyll, hence produce starch.

Q. 4. (i) What prevents the entry of food into trachea
while swallowing ?
(ii) Why rate of breathing is faster in aquatic animals
as compared to terrestrial animals ?
3

Ans. (i) Epiglottis : It covers the opening of wind pipe
during swallowing.
(ii) Because the amount of dissolved O2 in water is less
as compared to the air in atmosphere.
1½ + 1½
Q. 5. How are the alveoli designed to maximise the
exchange of gases ?
[NCERT] 3
Ans. (i) The alveoli are thin walled and richly supplied
with a network of blood vessels to facilitate
exchange of gases between blood and the air filled
in alveoli.
(ii) Alveoli have balloon like structure. Thus, provide
maximum surface for exchange of gases.
3
Q. 6. What constitutes one heart beat ? Is the pulse rate
same as heart beat rate ?
3
Ans. Heart beat is due to the rhythmic contraction
and relaxation of heart muscles. One contraction
(systole) and one relaxation (diastole) of heart
constitute one heartbeat.
The pulse rate is same as heart beat rate. The
rhythmic contraction of the heart is felt in certain
areas like the wrist in the form of pulsations, and
this is called pulse rate.
3
Q. 7. What is the need of four-chambered heart in
mammals while fishes have only two-chambered
heart ?
3
Ans. Mammals need more energy to maintain their body
temperature that’s why they have four chambered
heart. In the mammal heart, the oxygenated and
deoxygenated blood is not allowed to mix, and
this is achieved by the separation of the heart into
right side and left side. Such a separation of heart
provides an efficient method of supplying oxygen

152 ]
to the body. Fish have two chambered heart and
oxygenation of blood takes place in the gills and
passes directly to the rest of the body.
3
Q. 8. During summer season we drink a lot of water
in comparison to winter, yet we pass urine fewer
times in summer than in winter. What is the reason
behind this fact ?
3
Ans. During summer season, we lose a good amount
of water through perspiration to keep our body
temperature normal. While in winter, there is no
perspiration. That is why, in summer season we
drink a lot of water and pass urine fewer times. 3
Q. 9. Do the freshwater animals reabsorb water through
their excretory system like marine animals ?
Justify your answer.
3
Ans. The freshwater animals do not reabsorb water
through their excretory system because in case of
fresh water animals, large amount of water is taken
up through their skin and mouth.
The water content of the body is maintained by

Oswaal CBSE Question Bank, SCIENCE, Class – 10

getting rid of excess water through excretory
system. Marine animals need to conserve water
that’s why water is reabsorbed by excretory system
in marine animals.
3
Q. 10. The inner lining of the small intestine contains
numerous villi. Are villi helpful in food absorption ?
Give the reason behind your answer.
5
Ans. The major part of the process of digestion of food
takes place in the small intestine. The digested food
is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner
lining of the small intestine contains numerous
finger like projections called villi. The villi increase
the surface area for absorption. Each villus is
covered by a single layer of epithelium and contains
blood vessels and lymph vessel. The food diffuses
through the epithelium into the blood vessels.
Glucose, amino acids, minerals and vitamins are
absorbed in the blood vessels of the villi; the fatty
acids and glycerol are absorbed by lacteals, which
are carried to lymph vessels to the point where the
lymph vessels empty into the blood stream.

question stating ‘what is the reason behind regular
formation of cramps in cricketers ? Your brother
stated the answer as ‘ cramps are developed due
to tear in ligament’. Is this answer correct ? State
reasons for your answers.
3
Ans. No, the answer is not correct. Sometimes during
rigorous physical work or exercise the amount of
oxygen declines in our muscle cells. At this time
when the oxygen is less in amount, pyruvate breaks
down in insufficient oxygen and form lactic acid

Control and Co-ordination in Animals
Control and Coordination in Animals
.... P. 161
 It is brought about in all animals with the help of two main systems :
		 (a) Nervous system
		 (b) Endocrine system
Nervous System
 Control and coordination are provided by nervous and muscular tissues.
 Nervous tissue is made up of an organized network of nerve cells or neurons, and it specialized for conduction
information via electrical impulses from one part of the body to another.
 Nervous system is the system of conducting tissues that receives the stimulus and transmits it to other parts of the
body forming a network of nerves.
 The units which makes up the nervous system are called nerve cells or neurons.
 The receptors pass the information to the brain through a type of nerve cells called sensory neurons.
 Motor neurons transmit the information from the brain to the effector organs, mainly muscles and glands.
 Nerve Impulse : It is the information in the form of chemical and electrical signals passing through neurons. These
impulses are carried by dendrites towards the cell body.
 Neuromuscular Junction : It is the point where a muscle fibre comes in contact with a motor neuron carrying nerve
impulses from the central nervous system. The impulses travel from the neuron to the muscle fibres by means of
neurotransmitter in the same way as the transmission of impulses across a synapse between two neurons.
 Voluntary Action : These are the actions which need thinking and are performed knowingly i.e. these are controlled
by conscious thought.
		
Example : Speaking to a friend, writing a letter etc.
 Involuntary Action : These are not under the control of the will of an individual and are automatic response to a
stimulus which is not under the voluntary control of the brain.
		
Example : Touching a hot plate unknowingly.
Reflex Action
 Reflex action is quick, sudden and immediate response of the body to a stimulus. E.g., Knee jerk, withdrawal of
hand on touching hot object.
 Reflex arc : The pathway through which nerve impulse pass during reflex action is called reflex arc.

Q. 9. How does chemical co-ordination occur in

plants ?
[NCERT]
Ans. Chemical co-ordination in plants are achieved by
plant hormones, that help to co-ordinate growth,
development and responses to the environment. 1

Short Answer Type Questions-I
Q. 1. How does auxin promote phototropism ?

[Board Term I, Set-WDCXXOV, 2016]

Ans. Auxin - a plant hormone synthesised at the shoot
tips - helps the cells to grow longer. When light is
coming from one side of the plant, auxin diffuses
towards the shady side of the shoot.
This concentration of auxin stimulates the cells
to grow longer on the side of the shoot which is
away from light. Thus the plant appears to bend
towards light while growing this phenomenon is
called phototropism.
[CBSE Marking Scheme, 2016]
Detailed Answer :
Auxin is the hormone which is usually synthesised
in the young tip of roots and shoots. When light
is coming from one side of the plant, it diffuses
towards the shady side of the shoot which
stimulates the cells to grow longer, resulting in
the bending of shoot towards light, thus auxin
promotes phototropism.
2
Q. 2. How do auxins promote the growth of a tendril
around a support ?
[NCERT]
Ans. Auxins promote cell elongation and are present at
the shoot tip.
When the tendril comes in contact with a support,
auxin stimulates faster growth of the cells on the
opposite sides. Thus, the tendril coils around the
support.
2
Q. 3. Why is Abscisic acid called as stress hormone ?
[KVS 2017] [DDE 2017]
Ans. Abscisic acid is called stress hormones as it induces
various responses in plants against stress condition.

It induces the closure of the stomata during water
stress. It promotes seed dormancy and ensures seed
germination during favourable conditions.
Q. 4. How is the movement of leaves of the sensitive
plant different from the movement of a shoot
towards light ?
[NCERT]
Ans. Movement of leaves of the sensitive plant or
Mimosa Pudica or touch–me–not is a response to
touch (stimulus). The movement is not dependent
upon growth of the plant, while the movement of
shoot of a plant towards light is growth dependent
movement.
2
Q. 5. What are nastic and curvature movements ?
Give one example of each. [Board Term-I 2009]
Ans. Nastic Movement : They are non-directional
curvature movements of turgor or growth, when
the movements are determined by the structure of
the responding organ irrespective of the direction of
structure which is generally diffused. e.g., Drooping
and folding of leaves in sensitive plant in response
to shock (seismonasty).
Curvature Movement : They are changes in
orientation of some plant parts in relation to others
caused by intrinsic or external stimuli, e.g., sleep
movement or nyctinasty of legume leaves, bending
of stem towards light.
1+1
Q. 6. Explain the cause of shoots of the plant bending
towards light.
[Board Term I Comptt. 2008]
Ans. Stems are positively phototrophic and bend
towards the direction of light. The movement is
due to occurrence of more auxin on the darker side
and lesser auxin on the illuminated side. As a result,
there is more growth on the darker side which
causes the stem to bend towards light.

geotropism. Give one example of each.
[Board Term I Set-NS9SX1D, 2016]
Ans. The movement of plant part in response to gravity
is called geotropic movement and the phenomenon
involved is called geotropism.
When the tip of the stem grows away from the
earth’s gravitational forces, it is known as negative
geotropism and when the root tips grow towards
gravity, it is known as positive geotropism.
Stem shows negative geotropism
Roots show positive geotropism.

Gibberellins : These are the hormones that help
in the growth of the stem and flower.
Cytokinins : It promote cell division and delay
ageing in leaves. It reduces apical dominance
and also stimulates the leaf expansion.
Abscisic acid : It is a growth-inhibitor hormone
that reverses the growth-promoting effects of
auxin and gibberellins. It causes dormancy of
seeds, wilting of leaves, closing of stomata and
loss of proteins and chlorophyll.
Ethylene : It promotes transverse growth, also
promotes senescence and abscission of leaves. It
acts as an essential hormone for the ripening of
fruits.
(Any three)


Q. 7. How do auxins promotes the growth of a tendril

around a support ? Describe in brief.
[Board Term-I, 42 Set (42), 2012]

Ans. Auxins produced in the shoot tip move downwards
in the plant. These auxins cause cell elongation in
the growing tissues. In the tendrils, auxins move
away from the point of contact with the supporting
object. More growth occurs on the side away from
the support. As a result of unequal growth on the
two sides, the tendril coils around the support.

Q. 11. How do auxins help in bending of stem towards

light ? Explain.

[Board Term-I, Set (41), 2012]

Ans. When growing plants detect light, a hormone
called Auxin, synthesized at the shoot tip helps
the cells to grow longer. When light is coming
from one side of the plant, Auxin diffuses towards
the shady side of the shoot. This concentration of
Auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the
side of the shoot which is away from light. Thus,
plant appears to bend towards light.

Q. 2. (a) Write the names and one function of each of

any three growth hormones in plants.
(b) In the absence of muscle cells, how do plant cells
show movement ?
[Board Term-I, Set-5X7289R, 2014]
Ans. (a) Three growth hormones in plants are—
		(i) Auxin : It is synthesised in the young tip of
roots and shoots. It promotes elongation and
division of cell and root formation.
		(ii) Gibberellins : They help in the growth of the
stem.
		(iii) Cytokinins : They promote cell division and
delay leaf ageing.
(b) The ability of a plant to detect change and respond
to that change is termed as the sensitivity of the
plant. Yet plants have no nervous system and no
muscle tissue, they use electrical and chemical

(5 marks each)

means to convey the information from one cell
to another cell. The leaves of the sensitive plant
(Mimosa Pudica) folds up in response to touch.
These leaf movements are independent of growth
whereas, the directional movement of the shoot of

ORGANISMS
REPRODUCE ?

 Reproduction in animals and plants (asexual and sexual), reproductive health-need and methods of
family planning. Safe sex HIV/AIDS. Child bearing and women’s health.

Quick Review
Reproduction is the process by which living organisms produce new
individuals similar to themselves. It ensures continuity of life on earth.
TOPIC - 1
 Nucleus of the cell contains DNA (Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid) which is

time as well as basis for evolution.
		 Types of Reproduction
TOPIC - 3
		 (a) Asexual Reproduction
Reproduction in Human Beings
 A single individual give rise to new individual.
.... P. 194
 Gametes are not formed.
 New individual is identical to parent.
 Adopted by lower organisms.
		 (b) Sexual Reproduction
 Two individuals i.e., one male and one female are needed to give rise to new individual.
 Gametes are formed.
 New individual is genetically similar but not identical to parents.
 It is use ful to generate more variations in species.
 Adopted by higher organisms.
 Asexual reproduction takes place through fission, fragmentation, regeneration, budding vegetative propagation,
spore formation. These modes of reproduction depend on the body design of the organisms.
 Fission is of two types - binary fission and multiple fission.
 Binary fission is the division of one cell into two similar or identical cells. The nucleus first divides amitotically into
two, followed by the division of the cytoplasm. The cell finally splits into two daughter cells. e.g., Amoeba
 In multiple fission, many individuals are formed from a single individual. e.g., Plasmodium
 The nucleus divides repeatedly, producing many nuclei and many daughter cells are formed.
 Fragmentation : Multicellular organisms with simple body organisation such as filamentous algae—Spirogyra breaks
up into two or more small pieces of fragments upon maturation. These fragments grow into new individuals.
 Regeneration : It is the ability of a fully differentiated organism to give rise to new individual organisms from its
body parts. Small cut or broken parts of the organism’s body grow or regenerate into separate individuals. For
example : Planaria and Hydra.
 In budding, a small part of the body of the parent grows out as a bud which then detaches and becomes a new
organism. Hydra reproduces by budding using the regenerative cells.
		 Vegetative Propagation : In many plants, new plants develops from vegetative parts such as :
 By roots : E.g., dahlias, sweet potato.
 By stem : E.g., potato, ginger.
 By leaves : E.g., bryophyllum (leaf notches bear buds which develop into plants).
 Artificial methods :
		 (a) Grafting : E.g., Mango
		 (b) Cutting : E.g., Rose
		 (c) Layering : E.g., Jasmine


Oswaal CBSE Question Bank, SCIENCE, Class – 10

		 (d) Tissue culture : New plants are grown by using growing tip of a plant. These growing cells are kept in a
culture medium which leads to the formation of callus. Callus is then transferred to hormone medium which
causes growth and differentiation. E.g., ornamental plants, orchid.
		 Benefits of tissue culture :
 We can grow plants like banana, rose, jasmine etc. that have lost the capacity to produce seeds.
 New plants are genetically similar to parents.
 Spore Formation : Spores are small bulb like structures which are covered by thick walls. Under favourable
conditions, they germinate and produce new organism.
 Sexual reproduction in flowering plants takes place in the phylum angiosperm. The gametes are produced within
the flowers and the ovules are enclosed in a carpel.
 The flowers are usually bisexual i.e., male and female reproductive parts are present in the same plant. The main
parts of a flower are : sepals, petals, stamens and carpel.
 Stamens and carpels are the reproductive parts of a flower which contain the germ cells. The male organ of a flower
called ‘stamen’ makes the male gamete which are present in the pollen grain. The female organ of a flower called
‘carpel’ or ‘pistil’ makes the female gamete, which are present in ovules of the plant.
 Pollination is the transfer of pollen grain from the anther of a stamen to the stigma of a carpel. Pollination is of two
types : Self pollination and cross pollination.
 Embryo : It is the stage of development between the zygote or fertilized egg and the newly formed offspring.
		 Reproduction in Human Beings
 Humans use sexual mode of reproduction.
 Sexual maturation : The period of life when production of germ cells i.e., ova (female) and sperm (male) start in the
body. This period of sexual maturation is called puberty.
		 Changes at Puberty
		 (a) Common in male and female
 Thick hair growth in armpits and genital area.
 Skin becomes oily, may result in pimples.
		 (b) In girls
 Breast size begin to increase.
 Girls begin to menstruate.
		 (c) In boys
 Thick hair growth on face.
 Voice begin to crack.
		 These changes signals that sexual maturity is taking place.
		 Male Reproductive System
		 (a) Testes : A pair of testes are located inside scrotum which is present outside the abdominal cavity. Scrotum has
a relatively lower temperature needed for the production of sperms.
 Male germ cell i.e., sperms are formed here.
 Testes release male sex hormone (testosterone). Its function is :
		 (i) Regulate production of sperms.
		 (ii) Bring changes at puberty.
		 (b) Vas deferens : It passes sperms from testes up to urethra.
		 (c) Urethra : It is a common passage for both sperms and urine. Its outer covering is called penis.
		 (d) Associated glands : Seminal vesicles and prostate gland add their secretion to the sperms. This fluid provide
nourishment to sperms and make their transport easy.
			
Sperm along with secretion of glands form semen.
		 Female Reproductive System
		 (a) Ovary : A pair of ovary is located in both sides of abdomen.
 Female germ cells i.e., eggs are produced here.
 At the time of birth of a girl, thousands of immature eggs are present in the ovary.
 At the onset of puberty, some of these eggs start maturing.
		 (b) Oviduct or Fallopian tube
 Receives the egg produced by the ovary and transfer it to the uterus.
 Fertilisation i.e., fusion of gametes takes place here.
		 (c) Uterus : It is a bag-like structure where development of the baby takes place.
 Uterus opens into vagina through cervix.
 The embryo moves down to reach the uterus. The embedding of the embryo in the thick inner lining of the uterus
is called implantation.
 The time period from the development of foetus inside the uterus till birth is called gestation period. The act of
giving birth to the fully developed foetus at the end of gestation period is termed as parturition.

HOW DO ORGANISMS REPRODUCE ?

[ 175

The breakdown and removal of the inner, thick and soft lining of the uterus along with its blood vessels in the form
of vaginal bleeding is called menstrual flow or menstruation.
 Reproductive health is all those aspects of general health which help a person to lead a normal, safe and satisfying
reproductive life.
 Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) are the diseases which are spread by sexual contact from an infected person
to a healthy person. Some common STDs are Gonorrhoea, syphilis, trichomoniasis, AIDS.
 There are different methods which are developed to prevent and control pregnancy such as mechanical methods,
chemical methods, oral pills and surgical methods.
		 Contraception
 It is the avoidance of pregnancy, can be achieved by preventing the fertilisation of ova.
		 Methods of contraception
		 (a) Physical barrier
 To prevent union of egg and sperm.
 Use of condoms, cervical caps and diaphragm.
		 (b) Chemical methods
 Use of oral pills
 These change hormonal balance of body so that eggs are not released.
 May have side effects.
		 (c) Intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD)
 Copper-T or loop is placed in uterus to prevent pregnancy.
		 (d) Surgical methods
 In males the vas deferens is blocked to prevent sperm transfer called vasectomy.
 In females, the fallopian tube is blocked to prevent egg transfer called tubectomy.

Reproduction : It is the process of producing new individuals of the same species by existing organisms of a species
i.e. parents.
Asexual reproduction : It is the process of producing new organisms from a single parent without the involvement
of sex cells or gametes.
Fission : It is the simplest method of asexual reproduction in unicellular forms of life such as Amoeba, Paramecium
and other protozoan.
Binary fission : It is the division of one cell into two similar or identical cells. The nucleus first divides amitotically
into two, followed by the division of the cytoplasm. The cells finally splits into two daughter cells.
Fragmentation : It is an asexual reproduction in which a multicellular organisms breaks up into two or more small
pieces of fragment upon maturation.
Regeneration : It is the ability of a fully differentiated organism to give rise to new individual organism from its
body parts.
In vegetative propagation, new plants are obtained from the parts of old plants such as stem, roots and leaves,
without help of any reproductive organs.
Tissue culture : It is the production or propagation of new plants from isolated plant cells or small pieces of
plant tissue in a synthetic medium of culture solution. This technique is also known as micropropagation,
and In vitro culture because it takes place outside the body of the parent plant in a test tube using an artificial
environment.
Micropropagation technique : It is being used for the production of ornamental plants like orchids, Dahlia and
carnation.
Sexual reproduction : It is the process in which two sexes male and female are involved. The male sexual unit is
known as male gamete or sperm while female sexual unit is termed as female gamete or ova.
Pollination : It is the transfer of pollen grain from the anther of a stamen to the stigma of a carpel. The pollen grains
are transferred by many agents as insects, birds, man, wind and water.
Fertilization : It is defined as the fusion of a male gamete (sperm) with a female gamete (an ovum) to form a zygote
during sexual reproduction.
Zygote : The cell which is formed by the fusion of a male gamete and female gamete is called Zygote, i.e. it is a
‘fertilised ovum’ or ‘fertilized egg.’
Sex ratio : It is the ratio of the number of females to per thousand males in a population. The female-male sex ratio
must be maintained for a healthy society.
Population size : Organisms increase their population with the help of reproduction. The rates of birth and death
in a given population determines its size.

similarity.
[NCERT Exemplar 2017]

Ans. Clone is an organism which is genetically identically
with its parent organism. Cloning is an artificial
method of asexual reproduction.
Offsprings produced by asexual reproduction
exhibit remarkable similarities as no new
combination of genes takes place. The parental set
of genes is distributed in the offspring.

[Board Term II, Outside Delhi Set I, 2014]
OR

Explain how offsprings and parents of
organisms reproducing sexually have same
number of chromosomes ?
[NCERT
Exemplar 2017]
Ans. The first step in sexual reproduction is gamete
formation. In this step, the number of chromosomes
gets halved. Thus, each gamete receives half the
number of chromosomes to that of somatic cells.
During fertilisation, the fusion of male and female
gametes takes place, which results in the number
of chromosomes in the zygote to be equal to that
of somatic cells. Thus, the chromosomal number of
the sexually producing parents and their offspring
is the same.

Q. 5. In the context of reproduction of species state
the main difference between fission and
fragmentation. Also give one example of each.
[Board Term-II O.D. Set II, 2016]

Ans. Fission : It is the method of asexual reproduction
in unicellular forms of life.
In this process the parent organism splits to form
two or more daughter cells.
Example : Amoeba / Plasmodium / Paramecium.
(Or any other relevant example) 1, ½
Fragmentation : It is the process found in
multicellular organisms. The filament breaks up
into two or more pieces upon maturation. These
pieces then grow into new individuals
Example : Spirogyra.
Detailed Answer :
Fission : It is defined as the splitting of a
unicellular organism into two or more than two
separate daughter cells. It is the most common
and simplest method of asexual reproduction
3
in unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and

Protozoa. Generally it is of two types i.e. binary and
multiple fission. In binary fission, parent organism
divides into two identical daughter organism with
definite orientation. In multiple fission, parent
organism divides into many identical daughter
organisms. The nucleus of the cell splits repeatedly
to form many smaller nuclei called daughter nuclei
surrounded by a little bit of cytoplasm and thin
membrane around them.
1½
Fragmentation : It is a form of asexual reproduction
in which multicellular organisms like filamentous
algae (Spirogyra) break up into two or more small
fragments or pieces. On maturity, each of which
subsequently grows to form a complete new
organism.

Q. 14. Colonies of yeast fail to multiply in water, but

[Board Term II, Set-FF7NBE6, 2015]

[NCERT Exemplar, 2017]
Ans. Yeast is a unicellular fungus hand fungi have
saprophytic mode of nutrition. This means they
cannot produce their own food but require an
external source of carbon and energy. Therefore,
it cannot grow in water as water does not have
any carbon or energy source required for their
growth, while it can grow in sugar solution, where
it ferments sugar to produce energy and will have a
carbon source for growth. Hence, colonies of yeast
can be observed in sugar solution but cannot be
observed in water.

Q. 18. List any two modes of asexual reproduction in
animals. Under which mode of reproduction is
vegetative propagation placed and why ? List
two advantages of vegetative propagation.
[Board Term II, Outside Delhi Set II, 2014]
Ans. The two modes of asexual reproduction in animals
are :
(i) Binary fission, (ii) Budding.
Vegetative propagation is a form of asexual
reproduction. It is the ability of plants to produce
new plants from the vegetative parts, such as leaves,
stems and roots, under favourable conditions.
1
Advantages of vegetative propagation :
(i) Only one parent is required for reproduction;
this eliminates the need of special mechanisms
(pollination).
(ii) Many plants are able to tide over unfavourable
conditions because of the presence of vegetative
reproductive parts like tubers, corns and bulbs.
(iii) Plants that do not produce seeds are propagated by
this method, e.g., sugarcane and potato.
(iv) Vegetative propagation is a cheaper, easier and
rapid method of propagation in plants than
growing plants from their seeds. For example, lilies
grow very slowly and take four to seven years to
develop flowers when their seeds are grown, but
flowers are produced only after a year or two when
grown vegetatively.
(v) The trait (character) of the parent plant is preserved
and the offspring are genetically identical.

Q. 22. Define the following processes of asexual
reproduction :
(i) Spore formation, (ii) Regeneration, (iii)
Multiple fission.
[Board Term II, Set-8XSVHLC, 2014]
Ans. (i) Spore formation is a common method of
asexual reproduction in many lower forms of life,
like bacteria, fungi etc. It occurs mostly during
unfavourable conditions such as extreme heat,
dryness etc. The spores are asexual reproducing
bodies enclosed in a thick walled structure called
sporangium. On return of favourable conditions
the sporangium wall bursts and the spores are
released.
(ii) Regeneration means renewal, restoration, and
growth. The process of getting back a full organism
from its body parts is called regeneration. Some
organism like Hydra, Planaria have the capability to
develop a whole new organism from its cut body
parts. Regeneration of an organism occurs by the
process of growth and development. Regeneration
occurs in those organisms which have relatively
simple body organization consisting of few
specialized cells.
(iii) In multiple fission, the nucleus divides several
times simultaneously or successively into a
number of daughter nuclei and then the cytoplasm
divides into as many cells as there are nuclei,
each cell containing a nucleus. It is the common
form of asexual reproduction in certain acellular
organisms.

do organisms, whether reproduced
asexually or sexually maintain a constant
chromosome
number

several
generations ? Explain with the help of suitable
example.
[Board Term-II, Delhi Set-I, 2016]

Ans. (i) When organisms reproduce asexually, only
mitotic divisions are involved and the chromosome
number remains the same.
(ii) During asexual reproduction, the DNA (in the
chromosomes) or the cells involved are copied and
then equally divided among the two daughter cells.
Thus, chromosome number remains unchanged.½
(iii) In sexual reproduction, organisms produce
gametes through a special type of division, meiosis–
reductional division, in which the original number
of chromosomes becomes half. These two gametes
combine to form the zygote and the original number
of chromosomes is restored.
(iv) In sexual reproduction specialized cells / germ
cells with only half the number of chromosomes
are formed. When these germ cells from two
individuals combine to form a new individual, the
original chromosome number is restored. ½ + ½

(v) Example : In humans, the parents father and
mother each have 46 or 23 pairs of chromosomes.
In the gametes–the sperm has half the number
of chromosomes i.e., 23 and the egg also has 23
chromosomes. When the sperm and the egg fuse,
the zygote has 46 or 23 pairs of chromosomes. Thus,
the chromosome number remains constant.

Q. 26. What is the effect of DNA copying, which is not

perfectly accurate, on the reproduction process ?
How does the amount of DNA remain constant
though each new generation is a combination of
DNA copies of two individuals ?
[Board Term II, O.D. Set-III, 2014]
Ans. Reproduction results in the production of offspring
similar to parents in body design and form. The
exact blue prints of body design is inherited in the
offspring due to DNA replication/DNA copying.
The imperfect DNA copying results in genetic
variations that can be both useful or harmful for
the offspring. The useful variations gets selected
in nature and helps organism to survive in the
changing environment while harmful variation
gets eliminated.
If each new generation is to be the combination of
the DNA copies from two pre-existing individuals,
then each new generation will end up having twice
the amount of DNA that the previous generation
had. In sexual reproduction, the gametes usually
contain half number of chromosomes and same
numbers present in the body cells. These haploid
gametes when fuse produce a new cell with double
number of chromosomes than the gametes and
same as the body cells. In this way organisms restrict
doubling of DNA and maintain the chromosome
number.

[CBSE Marking Scheme, 2015] 5
		Detailed Answer :
(a) (i) Binary Fission in Amoeba—In this method,
the nucleus first divides amitotically into two,
followed by the division of the cytoplasm.
The cell finally splits into two daughter cells.
So, from one Amoeba parent, two daughter
amoebae are formed.
(ii) Budding in Hydra—In Budding, a small part
of the body of the parents grows out as a ‘bud’
which then detaches and becomes a new
organism. Hydra reproduces by budding using
the regenerative cells. A bud develops as an
outgrowth in hydra due to repeated cell division
at one specific site. When fully mature, the
bud detaches itself from the parent body and
develops into new independent individuals.
(iii) Regeneration in Planaria—In this method,
small cut or broken parts of the organisms body
grow or regenerate into separate individuals.

(v) Vegetative propagation and Spore formation
[Board Term II, Set-8XSVHLC, 2014]

186 ]

Oswaal CBSE Question Bank, SCIENCE, Class – 10

Ans. (i)
Pollen Tube

Style

Pollen tube is the part of
the male gametophyte
in plants. It is a long
tube like structure that
carries the male gamete
from the stigma to the
ovules.

It is a part of the
female reproductive
organ, carpel. It joins
the stigma to the ovary.
It is made up of soft
tissues which allows
the pollen tube to grow
downwards towards
the ovule.

(ii) Binary fission in Amoeba : A single cell divides itself
into two daughter cell is known as binary fission,
binary fission can also occur in particular axis. e.g.,
Amoeba.
Multiple fission in Plasmodium : It is also a mode
of asexual reproduction in which a cell divides itself
into many daughter cells simultaneously. It occur in
definite orientation. e.g., yeast , malarial parasites.
(iii) Regeneration is of two types, in the first type,
a part of the body that gets broken off or cut is
regenerated. For example, lizards cast off their tails
to escape predators and then regenerate them. The
other type of regeneration involve the capacity to
give rise to an entire organism from a cut part. It
is seen in small invertebrates such as Planaria and
Hydra.
Fragmentation is also a mode of asexual
reproduction. It is the unintentional cutting up of
the body of an organism which each grows into
different organism. It is most commonly seen in
some algae.
(iv) In Hydra, the cells divide rapidly at a specific site
and develop as an outgrowth called a bud. These
buds, while attached to the parent plant, develop
into small individuals. When this individual
becomes large enough, it detaches itself from
the parent body to exist as an independent
individual.
In the Bryophyllum the leaves have small buds (as
in potato). These buds later converts into small and
very small plants which also have roots present on
them. When these buds start growing further then
the leaf becomes heavy and falls on the ground.
Then the buds which are present on the leaf dumps
into ground and forms a plant.
(v) Vegetative propagation : It is the ability of plants to
reproduce by producing new plants from vegetative
parts such as roots, stem, and leaves.
Spore formation : Spore formation is the mode of
asexual reproduction in some organisms like fungi
in which it gives rise to a globular structure known
as sporangia, which contains spores. The sporangia
burst to release spores and each of these spores
germinates to produce a new individual.

[Board Term II, Foreign Set I, II, 2014]
Ans. (i) Sepals and petals : Sepals in the calyx cup
protect the flower in the bud stage. They persist
in the fruit. Petals of insect pollinated flowers are
brightly coloured and scented to attract bees and
butterflies for pollination. They are colourless and
inconspicuous in wind pollinated flowers.
(ii) Stamen : This is the male reproductive part of the
flower. The anther produces pollen grains.
(iii) Carpel : It has a swollen bottom part called ovary,
a middle elongated part called style and a sticky
terminal part called stigma. The ovary contains
ovules which contain the female gametes - the
eggs.

Q. 5. (i) What is the difference between selfpollination and cross pollination ?
(ii) What happens to the pollen which falls on a
suitable stigma ? Explain.
[Board Term II, 2011, Set B1]
Ans. (i) Self-pollination is the transfer of pollen grains
from the anther of one flower to the stigma of the
same flower or another flower of the same plant. 1
Cross pollination is the transfer of pollen-grain
from the anther of one flower to the stigma of
another flower growing on another plant of the
same species.
1
(ii) The pollen grain starts germinating and forms a
pollen tube. The pollen tube grows in the style
till reaches the ovule through micropyle where it
fertilizes with female gamete.
1
Q. 6. Enumerate the method of fertilisation as seen in
a flowering plant.
Ans. In plants, pollination is followed by fertilisation.
The pollen grains deposited on the stigma form
tubes called pollen tubes. One pollen tube grows
through the style and reaches the ovary, where
ovules are located. Inside the ovule, the pollen
tube releases two male gametes into the embryo
sac. The embryo sac of the ovule contains the egg.
One male gamete fuses with the egg. This fusion is
called Syngamy. The other male gamete fuses with
the polar nuclei. This process is called the triple
fusion. This mechanism of two fusions occurring
in an embryo sac is called double fertilisation. After

Q. 7. What is a seed ? How does it help in reproduction
in plants ?

Ans. A seed is the reproductive unit of a plant which
can be used to grow into a new plant. It contains a
body plant or embryo and food for the baby plant.
The baby plant present in a seed is in the dormant
or inactive state. When the seeds get suitable
conditions of water, warmth, air and light, then
new plants grow out of these seeds. In this way, the
parent plant reproduces more plants like itself by
forming seeds through flowers.

Q. 9. What is pollination ? How does it occur in
plants ? How does pollination lead to fertilization ?
Explain.
[Board Term II, O.D. Set-III, 2013]
Ans. The transfer of pollens from anther to the stigma of
a flower is called pollination.
The transfer is accomplished by an external agency
such as wind (anemophily), water (hydrophily),
insects (entomophily), birds (ornithophily), bats
(chiropterophily), etc. Both wind and water are
abiotic agencies while insects, birds, bats etc. are
biotic agencies of pollination.
After falling on stigma, the pollen grain absorbs
water and nutrients. It produces a tube called
pollen tube. Pollen tube grows through style
and reaches the ovary. Its tip contains a tube
nucleus and two male gametes or sperm cells. The
advancing pollen tube enters an ovule, generally
through micropyle and reaches the interior of the
embryo sac. Here the tube bursts to release its
two male gametes. One male gamete fuses with
egg to form zygote and the second male gamete
fuses with binucleate central cells which forms
endosperm.

Q. 9. What changes are observed in the uterus if
fertilisation does not occur ?
[NCERT Exemplar, 2017]
Ans. When an egg is released by ovary the walls of the
uterus thickens so as to give the fertilised egg a
smooth covering but as fertilisation doesn’t occur
the walls come back to their original position by
breaking down and thus the blood in it starts
flowing out through urethra.

fertilized egg. Its lining become thick to provide
nutrition to embryo, if fertilization of egg takes
place. If fertilization of egg does not take place then
lining is no longer needed and it gets detached and
comes out through the vagina along with blood and
mucus.

Q. 18. Write one difference between sexual and asexual
mode of reproduction. Which species is likely
to have better chances of survival – the one
reproducing asexually or the one reproducing
sexually ? Justify your answer.
[Board Term II, Outside Delhi Set III, 2014]
Ans. Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of the
male and the female gamete. This fusion allows
the formation of new variants by the combination
of the DNA from two (usually) different members
of the species. The variations allow the individuals
to adapt under varied environmental conditions for
better chances of survival.
1
However, it is not always necessary that the offspring
produced due to sexual reproduction has better
chances of survival. Under some circumstances,
asexual reproduction is more advantageous for
certain organisms. For example, some individuals
who do not move from one place to another
and are well settled in their environment. Also,
asexual reproduction is a fast and a quick mode of
reproduction which does not consume much time
and energy as compared to sexual reproduction. 2

Ans. Functions :
Ovary–

(i) Production of female

		
gamete
(ii) Production of female
		
hormone
Fallopian tube–

1

(i) Site of fertilization

(ii) Transfer
of
female
gamete from ovary.
1
Uterus–
(i) Implantation of zygote/
		
fertilise egg/embryo.
(ii) Nourishment to the
		
developing embryo.
1
Menstruation–(i) It is the periodic breakdown of
uterine lining and its removal along with blood
and mucous in (post pubertal stage of a) human
female.
1

(ii) Uterine lining is required to nourish the embryo
that is formed if fertilization takes place. In absence
of fertilization, the lining is not required and hence
is shed in the form of menstruation.

Q. 8. (a) Name the respective part of human female
reproductive system :
(i) that produces eggs,
(ii) where fusion of eggs and sperm takes place, and
(iii) where zygote gets implanted.
(b) Describe in brief what happens to the zygote after
it gets implanted.
[Board Term II,
Delhi Set I, II, Foreign Set I, II, III 2014]
Ans. (a) (i) Ovary
		(ii) Fallopian tube
		(iii) Uterus
(b) The zygote formed after fertilisation in the
fallopian tube is implanted in the uterus. It divides
repeatedly to form a mass of cells known as embryo.
This embryo gets attached to the inner layer of the
uterine cavity, i.e., endometrium. It thickens every
month and is supplied with blood to nourish the
embryo. Soon it gets covered by rapidly dividing
uterine cells. This leads to pregnancy.
Within a span of some months, the embryo
starts developing limbs and begins to resemble a
miniature human being. When all body parts of

lining (endometrium) becomes thick and is
supplied with blood to nourish the embryo. 1
		(ii) If the egg is not fertilised, then the uterus lining
is not required. Hence, it breaks down and
gets released in the form of blood and mucous
through the vagina. This process lasts for 2–8
days. This cycle occurs every month and is
known as menstruation.

High Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) Questions
Q. 1. Why is variation beneficial to the species, but not
necessarily for the individual ?
3
Ans. Variation is beneficial to the species but not
necessarily for the individuals because variations
present in some populations would enable them
to survive. In case of changing environment such
as global warming, it is useful for the survival of
species.
3
Q. 2. How will an organism be benefitted if it reproduces
through spores ?
3
Ans. An organism will be benefitted if it reproduces
through spores in the following ways :
(i) Spores are formed in large number
(ii) Spores have an outer thick wall that protects them
in adverse conditions until they come in contact
with another moist surface and begin to grow.
3
Q. 3. In a bisexual flower in spite of the young stamens
being removed artificially, the flower produces
fruit. Provide a suitable explanation for the above
situation.

Sex determination, Brief introduction; Basic concepts of evolution.

Quick Review
Variations arise during the process of reproduction. They may be few in asexual
reproduction, but many in case of sexual reproduction.
TOPIC - 1
 The minor variations arising during Sexual reproduction are caused by slight
Heredity and Mendel’s
inaccuracies in DNA copying. In sexual reproduction, variations are also caused
Contribution
.... P. 215
by crossing over process of meiosis.
TOPIC - 2
 Beneficial variations help the species to survive better in the environment.
Origin of Life and Evolution
 Nature selects the beneficial variations thereby leading to evolution.
.... P. 227
 Reproduction produces offsprings with similar body design of the parents.
However the offsprings are not identical, but show a great deal of variation
from the parents.
Importance of Variation :
(i) Depending upon the nature of variations different individuals would have different kinds of advantages.
		
Example, Bacteria that can withstand heat will survive better in a heat wave.
(ii) Main advantage of variation to species is that it increases the changes of its survival in a changing environment.
 Sexually reproducing organisms such as humans have two (or more) versions of genes for each trait, called alleles.
 Gregor Johann Mendel carried out several experiments on pea plants. He carried out large number of monohybrid
and dihybrid crosses using many contrasting characteristics and put forward several important conclusions.
Mendel and His Work on Inheritance
 Gregor Johann Mendel (1833 & 1884) : Started his experiments on plant breeding and hybridisation. He proposed
the laws of inheritance in living organisms.
Mendel was known as Father of Genetics.
 Plant selected by Mendel : Pisum sativum (garden pea). Mendel used a number of contrasting characters for garden
pea.
Seven pairs of contrasting characters in Garden Pea.

In case of monohybrid cross with pure variety of plants, the phenotypic ratio obtained in F2 generation is 3 : 1.
In case of dihybrid cross involving two pairs of contrasting characters, the phenotypic ratio obtained in F2 generation
is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.

HEREDITY AND EVOLUTION

Mendel concluded that out of any pair of contrasting characters, one is dominant and the other is recessive.
The homozygous dominant trait is denoted by two capital letters whereas the homozygous recessive trait is denoted
by two small letters.
The factors or genes controlling a particular trait separate from each other during gamete formation. Hence gamete
is always pure as far as contrasting characters are considered. Each gamete will possess only one gene set.
In crossing if two or more traits are involved, their genes assort independently, irrespective of the combinations
present in the parents.
Genes carry information for producing proteins, which in turn control the various body characteristics.
For a particular trait, the offspring receives one allele from the father and one allele from the mother.
The combination of the male and female germ cells gives a diploid zygote. Thus the normal diploid number of
chromosomes in the offspring is restored.
Different mechanisms are used for sex determination in different species.
Determination of sex of an offspring.
FACTORS
Responsible for sex Determination

Genetic
In some animals like humans
gender or
individual is determined by a
pair of
chromosomes called sex
chromosomes.
XY – Female
XY – Male
Sex Chromosomes : In human beings, there are 23 pairs of chromosome. Out of these 22 chromosomes pairs are
called autosomes and the last pair of chromosome which helps in deciding gender of the individual is called sex
chromosome.
XX – Female
XY – Male
SEX DETERMINATION IN HUMAN BEINGS

Evolution
 Evolution is the sequence of gradual changes which takes place in the primitive organisms, over millions of years,
in which new species are produced.
 Genetic drift can alter gene frequencies in small population and provide diversity without any survival benefits.
 Several factors such as environment, mutations, reproduction, etc can cause alterations in gene frequencies in a
population over generations, leading to evolution.
 Changes occurring in the DNA of germ cells are heritable whereas changes taking place in the non-reproductive
tissues are not inherited.
 Charles Darwin proposed that evolution of species occurred by natural selection, but he did not know the
underlying mechanism.
 Natural selection, genetic drift, variations and geographical isolation can lead to speciation in sexually reproducing
organisms.
 Gene flow between the members of a population prevents speciation.
 The fundamental characteristics used to classify organisms are :
(i)
presence of prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells.
		
(ii) whether the organism is unicellular or multicellular.

214 ]

Oswaal CBSE Question Bank, SCIENCE, Class – 10

		
(iii) ability to perform photosynthesis.
		
(iv) presence of endoskeleton or exoskeleton in heterotrophic organisms.
 Classification of living organisms is closely related to their evolution.
Evolution and Classification
Both evolution and classification are interlinked.
1.
Classification of species is reflection of their evolutionary relationship.
2.
The more characteristics two species have in common the more closely they are related.
3.
The more closely they are related, the more recently they have a common ancestor.
4.
Similarities among organisms allow us to group them together and to study their characteristics.
I.
Homologous Organs : (Morphological and anatomical evidences). These are the organs that have same
structural plan and origin but different functions.
Homologous organs provides evidence for evolution by telling us that they are derived from the same ancestor.
Example :
Forelimb of horse
(Running)
wings of bat
(Flying)
Same basic structural plan, but perform
Paw of a cat
(Walk/scratch/attack)
different functions
II. Analogous Organs : These are the organs that have different origin and structural plant but same function.
Example : Analogous organs provide mechanism for evolution.
Wings of bat →
Elongated fingers with
			
skin folds
Different basic structure, but perform similar
Wings of bird →
Feathery covering along function i.e., flight.
			
the arm
 Fossils help in tracing evolutionary pathways.
 The age of fossils can be determined by using the relative method or the isotope dating method.
 Evolution is not a one-step process, but a continuous process occurring in several stages.
 Complex organs are formed slowly over many generations, sometimes with intermediate forms playing an
important role.
 Sometimes the use of certain features gets modified with time. For example : Feathers may have provided insulation
initially, but later became associated with flight.
 Evolutionary studies have shown that birds are closely related to reptiles.
 Humans have carried out artificial selection for various features of cabbage and produced different vegetables.

Kale
Larger leaves
Molecular phylogeny can also be used to trace evolutionary relationships. Here the DNA of different species is
compared. Greater the differences in DNA, more distantly related are the species.
Disappearance of the existing species is not a requirement for formation of new species.
The new species formed are better adapted to the environment but they need not be superior to the existing
species.
The common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees evolved in different ways to produce the present forms.
Evolution produces more diverse and complex body forms over a period of time, but the newly formed species
are not more progressive than the already existing ones. So it is wrong to say that evolution produces progressive
higher forms from lower ones.
All human beings, whether fair skinned or dark skinned, belong to the same species i.e., Homo sapiens that originated
in Africa.
The human ancestors gradually migrated from Africa to various parts of the world such as Asia, Europe, Australia and
America. Thus they spread to different parts of the earth and adapted as best as they could to their environmental
conditions.

Q. 7. No two individuals are absolutely alike in
population. Why ?
[Board Term II, Outside Delhi Set-III, 2014]

216 ]
Ans. No two individuals are absolutely alike in a
population because variation arises due to DNA
copying.
1
Q. 8. How does comparing the DNA of different
species helps in evolutionary studies ?
Ans. Comparing the DNA of different species gives a
direct estimate of how much the DNA has changed
during the formation of these species. Thus, it helps
us to a great extent in tracing the evolutionary
pathways.
1
Q. 9. How do genes control traits ?
Ans. Genes
carry
information
for
producing
proteins, which in turn control the various body
characteristics.

Short Answer Type Questions-I
Q. 1. What are characteristics ? Give an example.

Ans. Characteristics are details of appearance of
behaviour, in other words, a particular form or
a particular function. Presence of four limbs in
humans is an example of characteristics.
2
Q. 2. Where are the genes located ? What is the
chemical nature of gene ?
[DDE 2017]
Ans. Genes are located on chromosomes in linear
sequence and at fixed positions.
1
Chemically genes are made up of nucleic acids
which constitute DNA.
1
Q. 3. Why will each gamete contain only one gene set ?

Ans. The genes controlling a particular trait separate from
each other during gamete formation. Hence gamete
is always pure as far as contrasting characters are
considered and will possess only one gene set.
2

Q. 4. Organisms showing asexual reproduction show

very little variation from each other. Why ?
Ans. In asexually reproducing organisms, there is no
mixing of genes of two different individuals since
only one partner is involved.
1
There are very minor variations generated in
such organisms due to small inaccuracies in DNA
copying.
1

Q. 5. “The chromosome number of the sexually

reproducing parents and their offspring is the
same.” Justify this statement.
[Board Term II, Delhi Set-I, 2013]
Ans. Male individual have 46 chromosomes but because
the gametes are always haploid i.e., they have half

(2 marks each)

the number of chromosomes; sperms will be haploid
(23 chromosomes). Female individual also contains
only 23 chromosomes in egg. It is the fusion of the
sperm and egg which leads to an offsprings with 46
chromosomes.
2
Q. 6. What is the difference between F1 generation

and F2 generation ?

Ans.
F1 generation

F2 generation

F1 generation refers to
the offspring resulting
immediately from a
cross among the first
set of parents.

F2 generation on the
other hand, refers to
the offspring resulting
from a cross among
the members of F1
generation.
2

Q. 7. During crossing, why do new features which

are not present in the parents appear in the
offsprings ?

Ans. In crossing, if two or more traits are involved, their
genes assort independently, irrespective of the
combinations present in the parents.
1
So, new combinations of genes appear in the
offsprings leading to new traits.
1
Q. 8. Why cannot the experiences of an individual

during its lifetime be passed on to its progeny ?

Ans. The experiences of an individual may only affect
the somatic cells, but will not change the DNA of
the germ cells.
1

[ 217

HEREDITY AND EVOLUTION

Change in non-reproductive tissues cannot be
passed on to the DNA of the germ cells. Therefore,
the experiences of an individual during its lifetime
cannot be passed on to its progeny.
1
Q. 9. Why are traits acquired during lifetime of an
individual not inherited ?
Ans. Traits acquired by an organism during its lifetime
are known as acquired traits.
1
These traits are not inherited because they do not
cause any change in the DNA of the organism.
1
Q. 10. How is the equal genetic contribution of male
and female parents ensured in the progeny ?
Ans. During sexual reproduction, a female gamete
(egg) fuses with a male gamete (sperm) which
are haploid to form zygote. Zygote is diploid and
contains 23 chromosomes from mother and 23
from father.
1
In this way, an equal genetic contribution of male
and female parents is ensured in the progeny.
1
Q. 11. If a trait A exists in 10% of a population of an

asexually reproducing species and a trait B
exists in 60% of the same population, which trait
is likely to have arisen earlier ?
Ans. As the population of the given species reproduce
asexually there would be only very minor
differences generated due to small inaccuracies in
DNA copying, so trait B is likely to be arisen earlier
as it is present in 60% of the population.
1
Trait A which exists in 10% of the population may
have originated due to variations.
1
Q. 12. A man with blood group A marries with a
woman with blood group O and their daughter
has blood group O. Is this information enough
to tell you which of the traits—blood group A or
O is dominant ? Why or why not ?
Ans. No, the information provided is not enough to tell
whether blood group A or O is dominant.
1
Every character is controlled by a pair of alleles.
And here it is not mentioned whether the man and
woman were homozygous or heterozygous for
their traits.

Q. 2. How do Mendel’s experiment show that traits are inherited independently ?

[Board Term II, O.D. Set I, 2016]

Ans. (i) When a cross was made between a tall pea plant with round seeds and a short pea plant with wrinkled seeds,
the F1 progeny plants are all tall with round seeds. This indicates that tallness and round seeds are the dominant
traits.
1
(ii) When the F1 plants are self pollinated the F2 progeny consisted of some tall plants with round seeds and some
short plants with wrinkled seeds which are the parental traits.

[Board Term II, Delhi Set II, 2015]
Ans. DNA replication or DNA copying is the process of
producing two identical replicas from one original
DNA molecule during cell division.
Importance of DNA Copying :
(i) DNA replication needs to occur so that during
cell division, new cells will also have a copy of
organism’s DNA.
(ii) DNA is necessary to make all the RNA and proteins
needed for cells to carry out necessary reactions and
cellular processes in order for them to survive.

Mendel’s Observation
F1 generation contained all tall plants. When F1
generation underwent selfing, the trait that was
unexpressed in F1 (dwarf) was observed in some
F2 progeny. Thus, both traits, tall and dwarf, were
expressed in F2 generation in the ratio 3 : 1.
The above experiment indicates that although
both the traits of tallness and shortness were
inherited in F1 plants, only the tallness trait was
expressed. This shows that traits may not show
up in an individual but are passed on to the next
generation.

Q. 8. “It is possible that a trait is inherited but may
not be expressed.” Give a suitable example to
justify this statement.
[Board Term II, Foreign I 2015]
Ans. Yes, it is possible.
1
		
Example—When pure tall pea plants are crossed
with pure dwarf pea plants, only tall pea plants are
obtained in F1 generation.
½
		
On selfing tall plants of F1, both tall and dwarf
plants are obtained in F2 generation in the ratio
3 : 1.
½
		
Reappearance of the dwarf character, a recessive
trait in F2 generation shows that the dwarf trait/
character was present in individuals of F1 but it did
not expressed (due to the presence of tallness, a
dominant trait/character).
1
		
[CBSE Marking Scheme, 2015]
Q. 9. How do Mendel’s experiments show that traits
may be dominant or recessive ?
[Board Term II, Set (2023), 2012]
Ans. When Mendel cross-pollinated a pure male tall pea
plant with a pure female dwarf pea plant, he got
only tall plants in the F1 generation.
When F1 tall plants were self-pollinated, Mendel
got both tall and dwarf plants in the F2 generation
in the ratio 3 : 1.
The trait of dwarfness was present in F1 generation
but was not expressed and only trait of tallness
was expressed. The character which gets
expressed in the presence of its contrasting form
is termed dominant trait. The trait which remains
unexpressed in the presence of its contrasting form
is termed recessive trait.

Ans. If pea plants with two different pairs of
characteristics are bred with each other, the F1
progeny would have all tall plants with round seeds.
This implies that round seed in dominant character
over wrinkled seed. In F2 progeny there would be
some tall plants with round seeds wrinkled seed.
However, there would be some plants with mixed
characters - tall plants with wrinkled seeds and
short plants with wrinkled seeds. However, there
would be some plants with mixed characters - tall
plants with wrinkled seeds and short plants with

determine sex of a newborn individual. It can be
environmental cues or genetically determined.’
Explain the statement by giving example for
each strategy.
[Board Term II, SQP, 2016]
Ans. Environmental Cue : (i) In some animals, the
temperature at which fertilized eggs are kept
determines whether the developing animal in egg
is male or female.
(ii) In some animals like snail, individual can change
sex.
Genetical Cue : A child who inherits an
X-chromosome from her father will be a girl and
one who inherits a Y- chromosome from the father
will be boy.

HEREDITY AND EVOLUTION

(ii) Consider tallness as a characteristic. Plant height
depends upon particular plant hormone which in
turn will depend on the efficiency of the process
for making it. If the enzyme responsible for the
production of this hormone is efficient, plant will
be tall. If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration
that makes enzyme less efficient, the amount of
hormone will be less and plant will be short.

Q. 29. With the help of suitable examples, explain why

certain traits cannot be passed on to the next
generation. What are such traits called ?
[Board Term II 2014; Outside Delhi Set I, 2015]

Ans. Such traits are called acquired traits. Acquired
traits are experienced by an individual during
his lifetime. These traits involve changes in
non- reproductive cells (somatic cells) which
are not transferred to germ cells. So, these traits
cannot be passed on to the next generation.
For example: Learning skills like swimming,

dancing, cooking, body building, etc are acquired
traits and cannot be passed on to the next
generation.

Q. 31. What are chromosomes ? Explain how in

sexually reproducing organisms the number of
chromosomes in the progeny is maintained.
[Board Term II, O.D. Set I, 2015]
Ans. Chromosomes are long thread-like structures which
contain hereditary information of the individual
and are thereby the carriers of genes.
Male individual have 46 chromosomes but because
the gametes are always haploid., i.e., they have
half the number of chromosomes; sperms will be
haploid (23 chromosomes). Female individual also
contains 23 chromosomes in egg. It is the fusion of
the sperm and egg which leads to an offspring’s
with 46 chromosomes.

Q. 32. ‘It is a matter of chance whether a couple will
give birth to a male child or a female child.”
Justify this statement with the help of a flow
chart showing the fusion of sex chromosomes.
[Board Term II, Outside Delhi Set II, 2014]
OR
How sex is determined in human beings ?
[KVS-2014]
Ans. Sex of a child is dependent on the type of the male
gamete fusing with the female gamete. Human
beings possess 23 pairs of chromosomes. Out of
these, 22 pairs are known as autosomes, while the
remaining one pair comprises sex chromosomes
(XX in females and XY in males). At the time of
fertilisation, the egg cell fuses with the sperm cell,
resulting in the formation of the zygote. If the
egg cell carrying an X chromosome fuses with the
sperm carrying an X chromosome, the resulting
child would be a girl. If the egg cell carrying an
X chromosome fuses with the sperm carrying
a Y chromosome, the resulting child would be
a boy.

(i) If a sperm carrying X chromosomes fertilises an
ovum which carries X chromosome, then the child
born will be a girl.
(ii) If a sperm carrying Y chromosome fertilises an
ovum which carries X-chromosome, then the child

(ii)
Why do all the gametes formed in human
females have an X chromosomes ?
[NCERT Exemplar 2017]
Ans. (i) No, because mothers have a pair of
X-chromosomes. All children will inherit an X
chromosome from their mother regardless of
whether they are boys or girls.
(ii) The 23rd pair in a somatic cell of human females
contains XX chromosomes. During gametogenesis,
each gamete gets one X-chromosome as the 23rd
chromosome. A girl child is born by the fusion of
two X-chromosomes. One X chromosome from
father and one X chromosome from mother. This
means a female has two X-chromosomes. 1½+1½

Example : Decrease in body weight of beetles due to starvation do not pass on to the next generation because
there is no change in the germ, cells of beetles.
[CBSE Marking Scheme, 2017]

[Topper Answer, 2017]
Detailed Answer :
Acquired traits are the characters that are acquired by the individual during its lifetime. These traits cannot be
inherited. For example, if a wrestler develops large muscles due to his training program that does not mean it will
be passed on to his offspring.
Inherited traits are the characters which are inherited by the offspring from the parents. These traits are expressed
in the offspring and later carried on to the next generation. For example skin colour, eye colour and shape.
Acquired traits occur due to changes in the lifestyles, injury, loss of body parts, disuse of some body parts. These
traits/experiences occur in the somatic cells which do not evolve germ cells and genetic materials. Therefore,
these traits are not transferred or inherited in the next generation. Example, low weight of a starving beetle. 5

[ 229

HEREDITY AND EVOLUTION

Geographical isolation prevents gene flow
between populations of a species whereas
asexual reproduction generally involves only one
individual. In an asexually reproducing organism,
variations can occur only when the copying of DNA
is not accurate. Therefore, geographical isolation
cannot prevent the formation of new species in an
asexually reproducing organism.

Q. 12. Give an example of characteristics being used
to determine how close two species are in
evolutionary terms.
Ans. Analogous organs are one such evidence that is
used to determine how close two species are related.
The presence of feathers in dinosaurs and birds
indicates that they are evolutionarily related.
Dinosaurs had feathers not for flying but instead
these feathers provided insulation to these warm-

blooded animals. However, the feathers in birds are
used for flight.
This proves that reptiles and birds are closely
related and that the evolution of wings started in
reptiles.

Q. 13. Explain the importance of fossils in deciding
evolutionary relationships.
[NCERT]
Ans. Fossils are very important in tracing the path of
evolution as by studying characters of fossils we
are able to find their descendants and thus we
can know what new variations have come. They
provide evidence and missing links between the
two classes. They are helpful in forming a sequence
of organisms in the pathway of evolution.

1
Role of Genetic drift and natural selection :
Genetic drift is flow of genes from one population
to another by chance factor or randomly. Over
generation it will accumulate different changes in
different population.
1
In addition, natural selection operates differently in
different population selecting the fittest / favourable
feature in both the population. Over a long period
of time the differences in the two population may
become so drastic that they no longer reproduce
with each other and thus give rise to new species.1

(3 marks each)

Factors which can lead to speciation are :
(i) Genetic drift may accumulate which lead to

(ii) Natural selection may work differently in different
location which may give rise to speciation.
(iii) Severe DNA change.
(iv) A variation may occur which does not allow
sexual act between two group.
(b) Natural Selection : (i) There is natural variation
within any population and same individuals have
more favourable variations than others.
(ii) Population remains fairly constant even though
all species produce a large number of offsprings.
(iii) This is due to ‘competition‘ or struggle for
existence between same and different species.
(iv) The struggle for survival within population
eliminates the unfit individuals and those with
‘favourable variations‘ survive and pass on these
variations to their progeny to continue. This is
called natural selection. The favourable variations
are accumulated over a long time period leading
to the origin of a new species.

Q. 4. “Natural Selection and Speciation leads to

evolution.“ Justify this statement.
[Delhi 31/1/2 2017]

Ans. l Natural selection is defined as the change in
frequency of some genes in a population, which
gives survival advantage to a species.
1
l Whereas speciation is the development of a new
species from pre-existing ones.
l This leads to a sequence of gradual change in the
primitive organisms over millions of years, to form
newer species which are very different from older
ones. This is called evolution.
[CBSE Marking Scheme 2017]

230 ]
Detailed Answer :
Natural selection is the phenomenon by which the
nature selects those species which possess survival
advantage over the other species. According to
theory of natural selection, there is struggle of
existence within the species of a population for the
environmental resources and their struggle leads
to survival of certain organisms and elimination
of the less competent species. The better adapted
organisms would, thus, survive and pass on their
traits to next generation, gradually leading to
evolution.
Speciation is a process of formation of new species
from the existing one due to reproductive isolation
of a part of its population. This reproductive
isolation can occur due to geographical isolation
of a part of population. With time, the genetic
drift will accumulate different variations in each
of the geographically separated sub-population.
Ultimately all the individuals of these two groups
will isolate reproductively, thus, leading to
formation and evolution of new species. Thus we
can say that both natural selection and speciation
lead to the evolution of species on earth.

Q. 5. Explain with an example for each, how the
following provides evidences in favour of
evolution in organisms :
(i) Homologous organs
(ii) Analogous organs
[Delhi 31/1/1 2017]
(iii) Fossils.
[Board Term II, Delhi Set II, 2015]
Ans. (i) Homologous organs : Forelimb of human and
bird are homologous organs. They have same
structural design and developmental origin but
they have different functions and appearance.
Homologous organs help us to understand that the
organism have evolved from a common ancestor.
The more common characteristics the two species
have the more closely they are related.
(ii) Analogous organs : Analogous organs are those
organs which have different basic structural
design and development origin but have similar
appearance and perform similar functions.
Example : The wings of birds and bats look similar
but have different design in their structure. They
have a common function of flying but their origins
are not common. So, birds and bats are not closely
related.
(iii) Fossils and their study is useful in knowing
about the species which are no longer alive. They
provide evidence and missing links between two
classes. They are helpful in forming a sequence of
organisms in the pathway of evolution.
Thus, fossils have an importance in deciding
evolutionary relationship. Archaeopteryx is a fossil
bird. It had feathers, fused bones and beak which
are exclusively bird structures. It also had some
features which are found in reptiles e.g., teeth
in jaw, claws on free fingers and a long tail. This
fossil provides a clue that birds have evolved from
reptiles.

(ii) Mutation plays a role in speciation. Changes in allele
and genotype frequencies within the populations,
by natural selection.
(iii) Genetic isolation leads to the formation of new
species.
(iv) Geographical barriers such as mountain ranges,
seas or rivers may produce a barrier to gene flow
and the inability of organisms or their gametes to
meet, leads to reproductive isolation and hence
speciation. Sometimes crossing of two unrelated
species (Genetic Engineering) can also lead to

Ans. Formation of new species because of barriers,
genetic drift and natural selection takes place
which leads to complex structures with better
survival advantage. This is known as evolution.
The traits, which are acquired during the life time
of an organism affect the structure and functioning
of cells, tissues and organs without affecting the
genetic material and thus are not inherited.

HEREDITY AND EVOLUTION

Q. 10. “Evolution and Classification of organisms are interlinked.‘‘ Give reasons to justify this statement.

[OD 31/1 2017]

Ans.

[Topper Answer 2017]
Detailed Answer :
Every organism has an in built tendency for genetic variation which plays an important role in the origin of
new species and forms the basis for evolution. The more characteristics two species have in common, the more
closely they are related. Classification of organisms involves organising them in different groups, based on
the similarities and dissimilarities of characteristics. Therefore, classification of species is a reflection on their
evolutionary relationship. Thus, we can say that evolution and classification of organisms are interlinked. 3

Q. 16. What are fossils ? State their importance in the

study of evolution with the help of a suitable
example.
[Board Term II, Delhi Set III, 2013]
OR
What are fossils ? What do they tell us about the
process of evolution ?
[NCERT]
Ans. Fossils are remains or impressions of past organisms
that are found in the rocks. Fossils of lower strata
belong to early periods while those of upper strata
are of later periods. Arranging the fossils stratum
wise will indicate the occurrence of different
forms of life at different times. It is found that the
early fossils generally belong to simple organisms.
Complexity and elaboration increased gradually
with evolution.
(i) Fossils indicate the path of evolution of different
groups.
(ii) They can indicate the phylogeny of some organisms.

Q. 20. Give two uses of fossils. How does the study

of fossils provide evidence in favour of organic
evolution ?
Ans. The two uses of fossils are :
(i) Racial history of plants.
½
(ii) Past climatic conditions of earth.
½
Study of fossils provide evidence in favour of
organic evolution because :
(i) Fossils helps to identify an evolutionary relationship
between apparently different species.

(ii) The fossils present in the bottom rocks are simple
while the most recent fossil found in the upper
strata are highly complex. This geographical
succession completely agrees with the concept of
evolution.

Q. 21. When organisms die, their bodies will
decompose and be lost. Then how do we get
fossils ? Give an example.
Ans. In most cases when organisms die, their bodies
decompose and become lost.
1
But every once in a while, the body or at least some
parts of the body may be in an environment that
does not decompose completely.
1
It is through such preserved traces of living
organisms that we get fossils.
For example : If a dead insect gets caught in hot
mud, it will not decompose quickly, the mud will
eventually harden and retain the impression of the
body parts of the insect.

Q. 22. How are fossil formed ? State any one role of
fossils in the study of organic evolution ?
[OD Comptt. 31/2 2017]
Ans. Formation : On certain occassions, a dead body
or at least some parts may be in an environment
that does not let it decompose completely and
gets preserved, subsequently either the part or its
impression becomes a fossil.
Role of Fossil : Provides missing link between the
species/who has evolved from whom.

Q. 26. “Evolution should not be equated with
progress”. Why ?
[Board Term II, Foreign Set III, 2014]
Ans. Evolution is simply the generation of diversity
and the shaping of the diversity by environmental
selection. Species adapt to the conditions available
in their environment. Some older and simple species
live on quite effectively. The only progressive
trend in evolution seems to be that more and more
complex body designs have emerged over time.

Why or why not ?
[NCERT]

Ans. Useful variations give advantage to individuals in
obtaining more food, reproduction, adaptation to
environmental changes and higher success in the
struggle for existence. They give benefit in survival
and increasing the population. Differential
reproduction increases the useful variations in
the populations. Other individuals with harmful

Q. 38. Does the occurrence of diversity of animals

on earth suggest their diverse ancestry also ?
Discuss this point in the light of evolution.
[NCERT Exemplar 2017]
Ans. Though animals have a vast diversity in structures
they probably do not have a common ancestry
because common ancestry may greatly limit the
extent of diversity. As many of these diverse animals
are inhabiting the same habitat, their evolution by
geographical isolation and speciation is also not
likely.

(ii) “Geographical isolation is not a major factor
in the speciation of a self pollinating plant
species.” Justify this statement with the help of an
example.		
Ans. (i) Male individual has 46 chromosomes but because
the gametes are always haploid i.e., they have half
the no. of chromosomes; sperms will be haploid
(23 chromosomes). Female individual also contains
only 23 chromosomes in egg. It is the fusion of this

species arise.
Factors :
			(i) Geographical isolation
			(ii) Genetic drift
			(iii) Natural selection

2

(b) (Any two with explanation)
(i)		 Genetic Drift : It is the random change in
the frequency of alleles in a population over
successive generations due to sampling error in
the gametes. Each new generation differs from
its parental generation with regard to the allele
frequencies simply because of random variation
in the distribution of gametes.
This process is more rapid in smaller population,
hence genetic drift can cause less of genetic
diversity if there are no counteracting factors. 1½

(ii)		 Natural Selection : It is the process, according
to Darwin, which brings about the evolution of
new species of animals and plants. Darwin found
that variations existed between individuals
of the population and concluded that disease,
competition and other forces acting on the
population eliminated those individuals which
are less well adapted to their environment. The
surviving population would pass the hereditary
advantageous characteristic to their offsprings.

Q. 7. What evidence do we have for the origin of life

from inanimate matter ?

[NCERT]

Ans. J.B.S. Haldane suggested that life must have
developed from the simple inorganic molecules
which were present on earth soon after it was
formed. He speculated that the conditions on earth
at that time could have given rise to more complex
organic molecules that were necessary for life. The
first primitive organisms would arise from further
chemical synthesis.
2
Later, Stanley L. Miller and Harold C. Urey
conducted experiment to find out about the
origin of organic molecules. They assembled an
atmosphere similar to that thought to exist on
early earth (molecules like ammonia, methane and
hydrogen sulphide, but no oxygen over water). This
was maintained at a temperature just below 100ºC
and sparks were passed through the mixture of gases
to stimulate lightning.

At the end of a week, 15% of the carbon had been
converted to simple compounds of carbon including

Q. 8. A particular species ‘X’ has more common

characteristics with species ‘Y’, whereas another
species ‘Z’ has less common characteristics
with species ‘Y’. Which two species are more
closely related ? Why ? On what basis are the
eukaryotic organisms further classified ? Why
is this basis important ? What is the importance
of homologous organs ?

Ans. Species ‘X’ is more closely related with species ‘Y’. 1
The more closely related species will have more
characteristics in common. Hence species X and Y
are closely related.
1
Eukaryotic organisms are further classified on
the basis of whether they are unicellular or multicellular.
1
This basis marks a very fundamental difference in
body design, because of specialisation of cell types
and tissues.

Homologous organs help to identify an
evolutionary relationship between apparently
different species.

High Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) Questions
Q. 1. Why did Mendel choose pea plant for his
experiments.
[NCERT Exemplar] 3
Ans. Mendel selected peas for his experiments
because :
(i) Many varieties are available with observable
contrasting characteristic or trait.
(ii) Peas are normally self pollinated and the flower
structure is suitable for cross-pollination. 1½+1½
Q. 2. Why is variation beneficial for the species, but not
necessarily for the individual ?
3
Ans. Accumulation of variation in a species enables
them to adapt according to the changes and the
new needs. This provide survival advantage to
the species. But an individual does not get any
advantage due to variation that takes place on him
Thus, variation is beneficial for a species, but not
necessary for the individual.
3
Q. 3. Describe briefly four ways in which individuals
with a particular trait may increase in a
population.
3
Ans. The four ways in which individuals with a
particular trait may increase in a population are as
follows :
(i) Sexual reproduction results into variations.
(ii) The individuals with special traits survive the attack
of their predators and multiply while the other will
perish.
(iii) Genetic drift provides diversity without any
adaptations.
(iv) Variations in the species may lead to increased

survival of the individuals.

Q. 4. A study found that children with light - coloured
eyes are likely to have parents with light - coloured
eyes. On this basis, can we say anything about
whether the light eye colour trait is dominant or
recessive ? Why or why not ?
3
Ans. We can say that light eyes colour trait is dominant
because only dominant traits are transferred from
the parents to the children in the first generation. 3
Q. 5. Explain with an example how traits get expressed ? 		
5
Ans. DNA is the source of information for making
proteins in the cell. The section of DNA is called
gene. For example, the height of a plant depends on
the hormone. The amount of hormone depends on
the process of its formation. A protein is important
for this process. If this protein works efficiently a lot
of hormone will be made. If the gene responsible
for that protein has an alteration, this will make the
protein less efficient. The amount of hormone will
be less and the plant will be short. Thus, traits get
expressed.
5
Q. 6. Define genetics. What is the contribution of
Mendel in this branch of biology ?
5
Ans. The science of heredity and variation is called
genetics. Mendel conducted breeding experiments
in a garden pea plant (Pisum sativum) with two
different contrasting characters. He found that
only one character appeared in first generation but
both the characters reappeared in the subsequent
generation. On the basis of results of his experiments,

he put forward the various principles of inheritance.
He also suggested that each character of pea plant is
controlled by ‘factor’.

transmission of ‘factor’ from parents to offspring as
conceived by Mendel and chromosomes through
gametes.
(b) What were the three main steps adopted by
Mendel for his breeding experiments ?

Q. 8. State and describe in brief any three main factors
responsible for the rise of a new species.
3
Ans. Factors responsible for rise of a new species are :
(i) Genetic drift : Over generation, genetic drift may
accumulate which lead to the formation of a new
species.
(ii) Natural selection : Due to natural selection,
variation may occur which lead to the formation of
a new species.
(iii) DNA change : Variation during DNA copying often
lead to the formation of a new species. (Any two) 3
Q. 9. List three roles of fossils in tracing evolutionary
relationships.
3
Ans. (i) Fossils and their study is useful in knowing about
the species which are no longer alive.
(ii) They provide evidence and missing links between
two classes.
(iii) They are helpful in forming a sequence of organisms
in the pathway of evolution. Thus, fossils have an
importance in deciding evolutionary relationship. 3
Q. 10. What is the significance of homologous and

analogous organs in the process of evolution ? 5
Ans. The significance of homologous and analogous
organs in the process of evolution are as follows :
(i) The existence of homologous anatomical
structures implies a common evolutionary origin
of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals from
same ancient fish ancestor.
2
(ii) The homologous structures seen in successive
generations indicate relationship and their
possessors are the diverse descendants of common
ancestry. They point to evolution and divergence
from the ancestral type.

(iii) Analogous organs have arisen in the evolutionary
process through adaptation of different organisms
to a similar mode of life.

Q. 11. How do you call in short the Lamarck’s theory

Ans. Lamarck theory is called theory of inheritance of
acquired characters. It says that the organisms
are exposed to new needs due to a change in the
environment. They acquire same characters during
their lifetime to adapt themselves to the new
needs. These characters are passed on to the next
generation. For example, the long neck of giraffe is
due to need to catch the leaves of long tress.
A. Weismann rejected the theory of Lamarck,
stating that adaptations based in the somatic cells
cannot be inherited.

Value Based Questions
Q. 1. Mrs. Sharma is pregnant for last three months and
she goes for regular check-up to her doctor. During
her last visit, the doctor asked Mrs. Sharma to get an
ultrasound done. Both Mr. and Mrs. Sharma went
to a radiologist and got the ultrasound done. Once
the ultrasound is over. Mr. Sharma asked the doctor
whether the baby in the womb is a boy or a girl.
(i) What should the doctor reply to the couple ?
(ii) Is ethical to determine the sex of a child ?

1
1

(iii) What should government do to discourage sex
determination ?
1
Ans. (i) The doctor should tell the couple that prenatal
sex determination is an offence. One should never
go for prenatal sex determination.
1
(ii) Both boys and girls have equal role and importance
in our society. Whether a baby is a boy or a girl,
they are all equal. It is unethical to determine the
prenatal sex of a child.

HEREDITY AND EVOLUTION

(iii) Law has already banned sex determination.
Anybody involved in sex determination act should
be punished. People should be made aware about
the ill effects of sex determination which lead to
female foeticide and consequently imbalanced ratio
of boys and girls.
1
Q. 2. Reproductive process gives rise to new individuals
that are similar but with some variations. Thus, the
similarities between parents and their offsprings
are due to heredity and the dissimilarities are
due to ‘variation’. Continuity of life is maintained
through heredity and evolution.
(i) What do you mean by variation ?

1

(ii) Why is variation beneficial for the species, but not
necessary for the individual ?
2
Ans. (i) Variation refers to the difference in the characters
or traits among the individuals of a species.
1
(ii) Variation enables the organisms to adapt themselves
in changing environment. It form the basis of
heredity. They form raw materials for evolution
and development of new species.
2
Q. 3. It is a disgrace for the Indian society which
consider birth of a girl child as burden. This narrow
view point of the Indian patriarchal society has
lead to the horrified practice of female foeticide.
Escalating demands for dowry is considered as the
main reason behind it. Daughters are unable to
provide social security to parents and are treated
as unwanted commodities. Strict implementation
of laws to stop female foeticide and dowry free
and compulsory education for girls may help in
eradicating this evil from the Indian society. Sex of
a child depends on father but often mother is cursed
in many societies for giving birth to a girl child.
(i) Do you think laws prohibiting pre-natal sex
determination should be strictly enforced.
Comment on the statement.
1
(ii) As a student, what initiative would you take in
the common concern of ‘Sex of a child depends on
the chromosome it inherits from father.’ Give any
three suggestions.
2
Ans. (i) Yes, pre-natal sex-determination should be
banned.
The female-male sex ratio should be maintained for
the benefit of society.
1
(ii) Suggestions :
		
(a) Dramas or plays to make awareness in the
public.

		
(b) Doctor’s camp to satisfy the confusions of the
people.
		
(c) Group discussion with people, about sex
determination.

Q. 4. While playing near a sugarcane field, Mohan
noticed that the plants are almost similar to one
another. At the same time, he noticed the mango
trees in the next plot of land are not similar to one

another. Mohan concluded there is little variation.
Mango reproduces sexually, hence there is larger
variation.
(i) Why sugarcane cannot reproduce sexually ?
(ii) Can mango reproduce asexually ?

1
1

(iii) If a person wants to have a flower garden, what
type of plants should he grow ?
1
Ans. (i) Because they do not bear flowers.
(ii) Yes, by grafting and layering.

1
1

(iii) Since, the flower garden will be ornamental in
natural, the person should plant saplings which are
obtained from the same parent asexually. This will
give a uniform look to his garden.
1
Q. 5. Fossils are the remains, traces or impression of
the dead animals and plants of geological past.
Fossils are formed layer by layer in the earth’s
crust. Fossils of prokaryotes were found in older
rocks than those of eukaryotes. Invertebrates were
formed before vertebrates. Among vertebrates,
fishes appeared earlier than amphibians and
amphibians appeared earlier than reptiles, which
are earlier than birds and mammals. Thus, fossils
provide evidence for evolution.
(i) What is the main factor on which formation of
fossil depends ?
1
(ii) What is fossil dating ? Why the study of fossils
important ?
2
Ans. (i) Decomposition of organisms.

1

(ii) The age of fossils can be estimated by fossil dating. 1
The study of fossils is important because :
(i) It helps to analyse racial history of plants and
animals.
½
(ii) It helps to measure the geological time.

½

Q. 6. Evolution is the change in the inherited traits of
a population of organisms through successive
generations. After a population splits into smaller
groups, these groups evolve independently
and diversity into new species. A hierarchy of
anatomical and genetic similarities, geographical
distribution of similar species and the fossil record
indicate that all organisms are descended from a
common ancestor. Laetoli is a site of Tanzania
famous for its hominid (human and its fossil
ancestors) footprints, preserved in volcanic ash.
(i) What is the main reason for evolution according to
Darwin ?
1

(ii) ‘Both Human beings and chimpanzee have a
common ancestor’. Justify the statement by giving
reason behind the conclusion.
2


Ans. (i) Natural selection and generation of new
species.
1+1

(ii) (a) Changes due to genetic drift and natural
selection will result in isolation of two subpopulation which become more and more
different from each other.

240 ]
		(b) Characters of the fossils also stated the
characteristics of ancestors.
1½+1½
Q. 7. Darwin’s theory of ‘Survival of the fittest‘ states
that only the fittest will survive.
(i) How will you relate the Darwin’s theory to your
day–to–day life ?
2
(ii) How will you make yourself fit for a particular
work?
1

Oswaal CBSE Question Bank, SCIENCE, Class – 10

Ans. (i) ‘The Survival of the fittest’ theory teaches us that
whatever work one does, he or she should do it
in the best way. For example, one who play very
well will only survive for long time in sports. One
who sings consistently well can only survive in the
singing field.
2
(ii) To be fit for a work, we must practice it again and
again. Practice will bring perfection in work.

 Concave mirror mostly forms real images, which can be received on the screen. Convex mirror always forms
virtual images, which cannot be received on the screen.
 Differentiating between a plane mirror, a concave mirror and a convex mirror, without touching them :
(i) If the image formed is erect and is of same size as in reality then it is a plane mirror.
		
(ii) If the image formed is still erect but smaller in size then it is a convex mirror.
		
(iii) If the image formed is erect but magnified when the mirror is close to the object, then it is a concave mirror.
 Solar concentrations use huge concave mirrors to focus large amount of solar energy thereby producing high
temperature conditions in a solar power plant.
 The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is a point called the pole of the mirror and is usually
represented by P.
 The horizontal line passing through the centre of curvature and pole of the spherical mirror is known as principal
axis.
 The centre of curvature of a spherical mirror is the centre of the hollow sphere of glass, of which the spherical
mirror is a part and is usually represented by C.
 The radius of curvature of a spherical mirror is the radius of the hollow sphere of glass, of which the spherical
mirror is a part and is usually represented by R.
 The diameter of the reflecting surface, i.e., twice the radius is called its aperture.

		If hi < ho then m < 1 i.e., image is diminished.
 Magnification of plane mirror is always + 1.
		 '+' sign indicates that virtual image.
		 '1' indicates that image is equal to object's size.
 If 'm' is '+ve' and less than 1, it is a convex mirror.
 If 'm' is '+ve' and more than 1, it is a convex mirror.
 If 'm' is '–ve', it is a concave mirror.
 The phenomenon of change in the path of light from one medium to another is called refraction of light.
 The angle formed between the incident ray and the normal is called angle of incidence and the angle formed
between the refracted ray and the normal is called angle of refraction.
 The cause of refraction is the change in the speed of light as it goes from one medium to another medium.
 Larger the difference in speed of light between the two media across the interface, the greater will be the angle of
bending and vice-versa.
 When a ray of light passes from a rarer medium to a denser medium, it bends towards the normal. Also, the angle
of incidence is greater than the angle of refraction.
 When a ray of light passes from a denser medium to a rarer medium, it bends away from the normal. Also, the
angle of incidence is less than the angle of refraction.

Know the Terms
 Ray and beam : Light travels in a straight line–Rectilinear propagation. The straight line indicating the path of the
light (arrow–direction) is called a ray. A bundle of rays originating from the same source of light in a particular
direction is called a beam of light.
 Parallel beam : When the rays which constitute the beam are parallel to one–another, then it is called a parallel
beam of light.
 Convergent beam : When the rays actually meet or appear to meet at a point, then the beam containing such rays
are called convergent beam and rays are called convergent rays.
 Divergent beam : When the rays actually diverge or appear to diverge from a point, then the beam containing
such rays are called divergent beam and rays are called divergent rays.

LIGHT–REFLECTION AND REFRACTION

 Image : The point of convergence or the point from where the light appears to diverge after reflection or refraction
is called image.
 Aperture : The width of the reflecting surface from which reflection takes place is called aperture.
 Pole : The central point of the reflecting spherical surface is called pole (P). It lies on the surface of the mirror.
 Centre of curvature : The centre of the hollow sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part, is called centre of
curvature (C).
 Radius of curvature : The separation between the pole and the centre of curvature cut of the hollow sphere, of
which the mirror is a part, is called radius of curvature (R).
 Principal axis : The straight line joining the pole and the centre of curvature is called principal axis.
 Focus : The point F on the principal axis, where a beam of light parallel to the principal axis actually meet after
reflection or appear to come it from it is called its principal focus.
 Focal length : The length or separation between the pole and the focus is called focal length.

Q. 16. Why does the bottom of a tank or a pond

containing water appear to be raised ?

Ans. Light from the bottom of the pond undergoes
change in path at the interface of air and water. As a
result, the rays appear to come from a raised surface
rather than the actual bottom surface of the pond. 1
Q. 17. Does the speed of light increases or decreases

in a medium in comparison to its value in
vacuum ? Give an illustrative example.

Ans. Speed of light decreases in the presence of a
medium e.g., When a light ray enters in water from
air, its speed decreases.

Value Based Questions
Q. 1. Nature of image formed by mirrors depends on the
nature of the mirror and the position of the object in
some cases. In a single array, one can make mirrors
of various nature. A universal mirror, an object

that reflects all light waves back at their source,
has been created by scientists in Europe and Asia.
Unlike an ordinary mirror, which reflects object at
90 degrees, a universal mirror reflects object back

Q. 10. Write two precautions to be taken while tracing the
path of a ray of light passing through a rectangular
glass slab for different angles of incidence.
Ans. (i) The glass slab should be perfectly rectangular
with all its faces smooth.
(ii) While fixing the pins P1 and P2 or the pins P3 and
P4, care should be taken to maintain a distance of
about 5 cm between the two pins. This would help
in tracing the direction of incident ray and that of
emergent ray with greater accuracy.
1+1
Q. 11. Write two precautions to be taken while tracing the
path of a ray of light passing through a rectangular
glass prism.
Ans. (i) While viewing the collinearity of pins and images,
the eye should be kept at a distance from the pins
so that all of them can be seen simultaneously. The
collinearity of pins fixed on one side of the glass
prism and the images of pins on the other side could
also be confirmed by moving the head slightly to
either side while viewing them. All the pins and
images of pins would appear to move together if
they are collinear.
(ii) The pins P1, P2, P3 and P4 fixed on the paper may
not be exactly perpendicular (or vertical) to the plane

of paper. It is therefore desirable to look at the feet
of the pins or their images while establishing their
collinearity. That is why the position of each pin is
marked with pointed tip of the pins on the paper.

Parts of Human Eye
 Cornea : It is the outermost, transparent part. It provides most of the refraction of light.
 Lens : It is composed of a fibrous, jelly like material. Provides the focused real and inverted image of the object on
the retina. This convex lens that converges light at retina.
 Iris : It is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the size of the pupil.
 Pupil : It is the window of the eye. It is the central aperture in iris. It regulates and controls the amount of light
entering the eye.
 Retina : It is a delicate membrane having enormous number of light sensitive cells.
 Far point : The maximum distance at which object can be seen clearly is far point of the eye. For a normal adult eye,
its value is infinity.

Presbyopia (Old age Hypermetropia)
 It is the defect of vision due to which an old person cannot see the nearby objects clearly due to less power of
accommodation of the eye.
l
The near-point of old person having presbyopia gradually recedes and becomes much more than 25 cm away.
 The phenomenon of splitting of white light into its constituent seven colours on passing through a glass prism is
called dispersion of light.
 Different colours undergo different deviations on passing through prism.
 If a second identical prism is placed in an inverted position with respect to the first prism, all the seven colours
recombine to form white light.
 Atmospheric refraction is the phenomenon of bending of light on passing through earth’s atmosphere.
 As we move above the surface of earth, density of air goes on decreasing.
 Light travelling from rarer to denser layers always bends towards the normal.
 Stars twinkle on account of atmospheric refraction.
 Sun appears to rise 2 minutes earlier and set 2 minutes later due to atmospheric refraction.
 The phenomenon in which a part of the light incident on a particle is redirected in different directions is called
scattering of light.
 Very small particles scatter light of shorter wavelengths better than longer wavelengths.
 The scattering of longer wavelengths of light increases as the size of the particle increases.
 Larger particles scatter light of all wavelengths equally well.

Range of Vision : The distance between far point and near point of the eye is called the range of vision.
Accommodation : The ability of an eye lens to adjust its focal length by the action of ciliary muscles to get a clear
and sharp image of the distant object as well as nearby object is called accommodation. For a person having normal
vision, it is about 4 dioptres.
Power of Accommodation : The maximum variation in the converging power (focal length) of eye lens so that the
far–off and nearby objects are viewed clearly is called power of accommodation.
Persistence of vision : The time for which the impression or sensation of an object continues in the eye is called the
persistence of vision. It is about 1/16th of a second.
Prism : Prism is a homogenous, transparent, refracting material, such as glass, enclosed by two inclined plane
refracting surfaces, at some fixed angle, called refracting angle or angle of prism. It has two triangular bases and
three rectangular lateral surfaces which are inclined to each other.
Angle of Refraction : The angle between the refracted ray and the normal is called angle of refraction (∠n).
Angle of Emergence : The angle between the emergent ray and normal at the second refracting face of the prism
is called angle of emergence (∠e).
Angle of Deviation : The angle formed between the incident ray produced in the forward direction and emergent
ray produced in the backward direction in the refraction through the prism is called angle of deviation (∠d).
Dispersion : The splitting up of white light into its constituent colours is called dispersion. It occurs because
refraction or bending differs with the colour.
Atmospheric Refraction : Change in the direction of propagation of light rays travelling through the atmosphere
due to change in density of the different layers of air is called atmospheric refraction.
Scattering of Light : The phenomenon of change in the direction of propagation of light caused by the large
number of molecules, such as smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles of dust and molecules of air present
in the earth’s atmosphere is called scattering of light.
Tyndall effect : The phenomenon of scattering of light by the colloidal particles is known as tyndall effect.

Q. 2. What is meant by the term ‘power of
accommodation‘ of human eye ? How does it
help a person to see nearby as well as distant
objects clearly ? [Board Term II Foreign 2012]
OR
How are we able to see nearby and also the distant
objects clearly ?
(NCERT Exemplar)
Ans. Power of accommodation of human eye : The
ability of eye lens to adjust its focal length to form
the sharp image of the object at varying distance on
the retina is called its power of accommodation.
The curvature of eye lens can be changed (i.e.
change in its focal length) to some extent by the
ciliary muscles.
When we are looking at the nearby objects, the
ciliary muscles contract, it increases the thickness of
eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker. As a
result, the focal length of eye lens decreases in such
a way that the clear sharp image of nearby object is
formed on the retina. Thus, the object is seen clearly
to us. When we are looking at the distance objects,
these muscles are in relaxed position, the eye lens
becomes thinner, focal length of the lens increases.
Therefore, the parallel rays coming from the distant
object are focussed on the retina and object is seen
clearly to us. Thus, the accommodation power of an
eye helps a person to see nearby as well as distant
objects clearly.

Q. 3. (i) What is meant by ‘least distance of distinct

vision’ ?
(ii) How does iris controls the size of the pupil in
bright light and dim light ?
Ans. (i) The minimum distance at which objects can be
seen most distinctly without strain is called the least
distance of distinct vision.
1
(ii) In bright light, the iris contracts the pupil to allow
less light to enter the eye. In dim light, the iris
expands the pupil to allow more light to enter the
eye.

Q. 4. With the help of ciliary muscles the human eye
can change its curvature and thus alter the focal
length of its lens. State the changes that occur
in the curvature and focal length of the eye lens
while viewing (a) a distance object, (b) nearby
objects.
Explain, why a normal eye is not able to see
distinctly the object placed closer than 25 cm,
without putting any strain on the eye.
[Delhi 31/1/2 2017]
Ans. (i) When we see distant objects, the ciliary muscles
relax/expand to decrease the curvature and thereby
increase the focal length of the lens. Hence, the lens
becomes thin. This enables us to see the distant
object clearly. Thus, the focal length of the eye lens
increases while seeing distant objects.

[ 289

HUMAN EYE AND COLOURFUL WORLD

(ii) To see the nearby objects clearly, the focal length
of the lens should be shorter. For this, the ciliary
muscles contract to increase the curvature and
thereby decrease the focal length of the lens Hence,
the lens becomes thick. This enables you to see the
nearby objects clearly.

N

A normal eye is not able to see distinctly the objects
placed closer than 25 cm, without putting any strain
on the eye. This is because the ciliary muscles of
eyes are unable to contract beyond a certain limit.
If the objects are placed at a distance less than 25
cm from the eye, then the objects appear blurred
because light rays coming from the object meet
beyond the retina.

Detailed Answer :
The defect caused due to gradual weakening of
ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the eye
lens is presbyopia.
The type of lens required by such person to improve
the vision is bifocal lens.

A bifocal lens consists of both convex lens and
concave lenses. The convex lens used in bifocal lens
is used to correct hypermetropia (far-sightedness)
and concave lens is used to correct myopia (shortsightedness).

Q. 10. Write about power of accommodation of human
eye. Explain why the image distance in the eye
does not change when we change the distance
of an object from the eye ? [Delhi 31/1/3 2017]
Ans. The ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is
called power of accommodation.
The focal length of the eye lens is adjusted so that
the image distance does not change. Thus the image
distance is equal to distance from the centre of the
eye lens to the retina.

Q. 12. Discuss how the brain perceives the image
formed on the retina.
Ans. Retina contains light sensitive cells known as
rods and cones. These cells get activated upon
illumination and generate electrical signals or

[Board Term II, Outside Delhi Set-I, III, 2014]
Ans. (i) The pupil is the perforation in the iris. It is the
pupil (or aperture of the eye) through which light
enters our eyes. The relaxation and contraction of
the muscular fibres of the iris regulate the opening
and closing of the pupil. Hence, it is the pupil that
controls the amount of light entering our eyes.
(ii) The retina is the “film” of the eye like the film of a

Myopia (short-sightedness) : It is corrected by using
spectacles having concave lenses of appropriate
power.
Hypermetropia (far-sightedness) : It is corrected
by using spectacles having convex lenses of
appropriate power.
Presbyopia : This defect is corrected using bifocal
lenses of appropriate power in which the upper
part consists of a concave lens (to correct myopia)
and the lower part consists of a convex lens (to
correct hypermetropia).

(i) the focal length of the eye lens is too long, or
(ii) the eyeball has become too small.
Such a person has to keep a reading material
much beyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable
reading. This is because the light rays from a
nearby object are focused at a point behind the
retina.
Correction of Hypermetropia :
(i) This defect can be corrected by using a convex
lens of appropriate power.
(ii) Eye-glasses with converging lenses provide the
additional focusing power required for forming
the image on the retina.

[Board Term II, Foreign Set-I, 2015]
Ans. Stars are very distant and approximate pointsized sources.
½
Path of star light changes continuously due to
gradual changing of refractive index of the layers

index of hot air is less than that of cool air. So, the
physical condition of the medium are not constant.
Due to changing Refractive Index (RI) of medium,

Q. 9. During sunrise and sunset sky appears red

while during the day it appears blue. Explain
these natural phenomenon.
[Board Term II, Set (2045), 2012]

Ans.		 This is because of scattering of light.
1
		 Light from the sun near the horizon passes
through larger distance in the earth’s atmosphere
before reaching our eyes. So, most of the blue light
and shorter wavelengths are scattered away by
the particles.

296 ]

Oswaal CBSE Question Bank, SCIENCE, Class – 10

Therefore, the light that reaches our eyes is
of longer wavelengths. This gives rise to the
reddish appearance. But during the day shorter
wavelength are scattered more by molecules of air
and scattered blue light enters our eyes.

1
If we consider a planet as a collection of large
number of point-sized sources of light, the total
variation in the amount of light entering our eye
due to gradual change of refractive index of the

½+½
Q. 15. Why does the sun look reddish at the time of
sunrise and sunset ? Explain.
[Board Term II, Set B1, 2011]
Ans. At the time of sunrise or sunset when the sun is
near the horizon, the sunlight has to travel the
larger distance through the atmosphere to reach
us. During this long journey of sunlight, most of
the shorter wavelength blue-colour present in it
is scattered out and away from our line of sight.
So, the light reaching us at the time of sunrise and
sunset consists mainly of longer wavelength red
colour due to which it appears to be red.

Q. 11. Why do different colours get separated when
white light passes through a prism ? How can
we recombine the components of white light
after a prism has separated them. Explain.

[Board Term II, Foreign Set-II, 2014]
Ans. A spectrum is the band of distinct colours we obtain
when the white light is splitted by a prism. We can
recombine the component of white light by passing
them through a prism placed upside down near the
given prism. When we pass white light through
two identical prisms held side by side with their
refracting edges in opposite directions; the first
prism disperses white light but the second prism
recombines them. Thus light emerging from second
prism is white.

Q. 12. Why danger signs are made in red colour ?

[DDE 2017]
Ans. Red is the least scattered colour. It is least scattered
by fog and smoke and can be seen in the same

Why is the colour of the clear sky blue ?
[NCERT Exemplar]
Ans. The molecules of air and other fine particles in the
atmosphere have size smaller than the wavelength
of the visible light.
1
These are more effective in scattering light of
shorter wavelength at the blue end than the light
of longer wavelength at the red end. Thus, the blue
colour is due to the scattering of sunlight through
fine particles in air.

Q. 17. Stars twinkle while the planets do not. Why ?
[Board Term II, Set (2008) 2012, Set B1, 2011]
Ans. Continuously changing atmosphere refract light
from the stars by different amounts from one
moment to the other. When atmosphere refracts
more starlight towards us, the stars appears to
be bright and when the atmosphere refracts less
starlight, then the stars appear to be dim.
1
However the planets are nearer to us than the stars,
they appears to be comparatively bigger to us so
they cannot be considered as a point source, hence
no twinkling is seen.

Q. 1. State the cause of dispersion of white light

passing through a glass prism. How did Newton
show that white light of sun contains seven
colours using two identical glass prisms. Draw
a ray diagram to show the path of light when two
identical glass prisms are arranged together in
inverted position with respect to each other and
a narrow beam of white light is allowed to fall
obliquely on one of the focus of the first prism.
[Board Term II Delhi Set-III, 2016]
[OD 31/1 2017]

Ans. Cause of dispersion of white light : Different
colours of light bend through different angles
with respect to the incident ray as they pass
through a prism. Violet light bends the most and
red the least. Thus, the each colour emerges along
different paths.

appears blue and the sun appears reddish at
sunrise and sunset. Explain these phenomena
with reason. [Board Term II Delhi Set-II, 2016]
OR
What is the difference of colours of the sun
observed during sunrise/sunset and noon ?
Give explanation of each ? [NCERT Exemplar]
Ans. (i) Scattering of light – Phenomenon of spreading
of light (diffused reflection) by minute particles in a
medium.
1
(ii) The sky appears blue because the blue colour of
sunlight scatters much more strongly than the red
colour by particles in atmosphere/ air due to its
shorter wavelength.
1
(iii) At sun-rise and sun-set most of the blue light and
shorter wavelengths are scattered away by the
particles in the atmosphere as the light from the
sun near the horizon passes through thick layers
of air and larger distance. The light that reaches
us is of longer wavelength (red colour) giving a
reddish appearance.

Q. 3. How does refraction of light take place in the
atmosphere ? Explain the reason why stars
appear to twinkle and the planets do not
twinkle.
[Delhi Comptt. 31/1/2 2017]

(3 marks each)

Ans. l Since the atmosphere consists of varying
densities the apparent position of the object, as
seen through the hot air fluctuates. This wavering
of light is an effect on atmospheric refraction. 1
l The twinkling of a star is due to atmosphere
refraction of star light. The atmospheric refraction
of light occurs in a medium of gradually changing
refractive index.
The planets are much closer to the earth and
are thus seen as extended sources. A planet is
considered as a collection of large number of
point sized sources of light, the total variation
in the amount of light entering our eye from all
individual point sized sources will average out to
zero, thereby nullifying the twinkling effect.
Q. 4. Define angle of deviation. Why do different
components of white light split up into
spectrum when it passes through a triangular
glass prism ? Show the angle of deviation for
red colour when white light passes through a
prism.
[Board Term II, Set-QNA4XWT, 2014]
Ans. The angle between the extended incident ray and
the emergent ray is called the angle of deviation.
This is because the different colours travel through
a glass prism at different speeds.

[Board Term II, Foreign Set-I, 2015]



Ans. The sun rays have to travel through a larger
atmospheric distance. As λb < λr, most of the blue
light and shorter wavelengths are removed by
scattering. Only red colour, which is least scattered
is received by our eye and appears to come from
sun. Hence the appearance of sun at sunset or

reddish.

HUMAN EYE AND COLOURFUL WORLD

Ans. (i) During morning, sun rays travel large distances
in the earth’s atmosphere, and in this process the
shorter wavelengths scatter away and only large
wave length (red light) reaches us.
1
(ii) At noon, sun is overhead and light rays travel
comparatively smaller distance and only little of
blue / violet light scatter, so sun appears white. 1
(iii) No atmosphere in outer space for scattering, so

Q. 14. (i) “Stars seem higher than they actually are”
(ii) “The sky appears dark to passengers flying at very
high altitudes”
Justify these statements with reason.
[Board Term II, Set 8XSVHLC, 2014]

Ans. (i) Light coming from the stars are supposed to
travel in a straight line. But the refractive index
of air is not same throughout. It changes as hot
air is rarer than cold air. So refraction takes place.
In this case, starlight continuously travels from
a rarer medium to a denser medium. Hence, it
continuously bends towards the normal.
1½
The continuous bending of starlight towards the
normal results in a rise of the apparent position of
the star.
(ii) Scattering of light take place because of the
particles present in atmosphere. At high altitude
due to absence of atmosphere scattering of light
do not take place and hence sky appears dark to
passengers flying at high altitude.

Q. 17. Why does the sun seem to rise two minutes
before the actual sunrise and set two minutes
after the actual sunset ? Explain with the help of
labelled diagram.

[Board Term II, Delhi Set-II, 2014]
Ans. The Sun is visible to us two minutes before the
sunrise and two minutes after the sunset because
of the bending of the light due to atmospheric
refraction. The actual sunrise takes place when
the Sun is just above the horizon. But due to
atmospheric refraction of light, we see the Sun
about two minutes before it is actually above the
horizon.
When the Sun is slightly below the horizon, its light
moves from less dense air to more dense air and
gets refracted towards the normal. Because of this
atmospheric refraction, the Sun appears to be above
the horizon when it is actually slightly below the
horizon. It is also due to atmospheric refraction that
we can still see the Sun for about two minutes even
after it has set below the horizon.

Q. 18. Explain giving reason why the sky appears blue

to an observer from the surface of the earth ?
What will the colour of the sky be for an astronaut
staying in the international space station orbiting
the earth ? Justify your answer giving reason.

[Board Term II, Delhi Set-I, 2014]

Ans. Sunlight reaches the Earth’s atmosphere and is
scattered in all directions by the gases and particles
in the air. Blue light is scattered more than the other
colours because it has the shortest wavelength. This
is why the sky appears blue to an observer from the
surface of the Earth.

For an astronaut staying in the international space
station orbiting the Earth, the colour of the sky
will be black because the light reaching it does not
scatter.

Earth

Q. 19. Explain with the help of labelled diagram, the

cause of twinkling of stars.

Ans. Light coming from the stars undergoes refraction
on entering the Earth’s atmosphere. This refraction
continues until it reaches the Earth’s surface. This
happens because of uneven heating of atmospheric
air. Hence, the atmospheric air has changing
refractive index at various altitudes. In this case,
starlight continuously travels from a rarer medium
to a denser medium. Hence, it continuously bends
towards the normal.

Apparent position
Refractive index
increases with decrease
in altitude

Real position

The refractive index of air medium gradually
increases with a decrease in altitude. The continuous
bending of starlight towards the normal results in a
slight rise of the apparent position of the star.
Apparent position
Real position

Refractive index of
air increasing

Since the physical conditions of the Earth’s
atmosphere keeps changing, the apparent position
of the star is not stationary. The star changes its
position continuously, which makes it twinkle.
This happens because starlight travels a very large
distance before reaching the observer. However,
the path varies continuously because of uneven
atmospheric conditions. Hence, the stars seem to
be fluctuating, sometimes appearing brighter and
sometimes fainter. All this together, gives rise to the
twinkling effect of stars.

(ii) Define dispersion. How does a prism disperse
white light ? [Board Term II, Foreign Set-I, 2014]
(iii) Which colour of light bends the most and the
least?

Ans. (i) In the region above the fire, the hot air is lighter
than the cool air above it. Further the refractive
index of hotter region is less than the cooler region
and it is not static.
1
These physical conditions are not steady.
Subsequently the image when seen through the hot
region is not stationary. The apparent position of
the object fluctuates. This gives the wavering effect
to the image.
1
(ii) The phenomenon of obtaining a spectrum of
colours by passing white light through the prism is
known as dispersion.
½
Dispersion occurs because the refraction of different
colours travel with different speeds in a refracting
medium. Speed of violet colour is least and that
of the red colour is the most. Hence the refractive
index of the medium is largest for violet colour and
least for the red colour.
1
(iii) As a result, the refraction or bending of violet colour
is the maximum and that of red colour is minimum.
This difference in the extent of bending of different
colour of light causes dispersion of white light into
its constituent colours as they emerge out of prism.
Red colour bends the least and violet bends the
most.

Q. 2. Why is a normal eye not able to see clearly the
objects placed close than 25 cm ?
[NCERT] 3

HUMAN EYE AND COLOURFUL WORLD

Ans. Focal length of the eye lens cannot be reduced
below a certain limit.
If an object is placed very close to the eye lens less
than 25 cm, the ciliary muscles cannot contract
further to make eye lens more thick. So, eye lens
become unable to form sharp image on the retina.
Therefore, we cannot see an object clearly if it is
placed very close to the eye i.e. less than 25 cm. 3
Q. 3. Why is a concave lens used to correct myopia or
short- sightedness ?
3
Ans. A concave lens of suitable focal length diverges
the parallel rays from the distant objects as if they
are coming from the far point F of the myopic eye.
This helps the eye lens to form a clear image at the
retina.
3
Q. 4. A hypermetropic person prefers to remove his
spectacles, while driving. Give reason.
3
Ans. When a hypermetropic person wearing the
spectacles looks at a distant object, the parallel rays
from the distant object get converged in front of the
retina. The image appears blurred, in order to avoid
this, the person prefers to remove his spectacles. 3
Q. 5. Explain why ?
(i) Myopic person prefer to remove his spectacles
while reading a book.
3
(ii) A hypermetropic person prefer to remove the
spectacles while looking at the sky?
2
Ans. (i) Myopic person does not need spectacles while
reading a book as he has the near point at 25 cm.
If such person reads the book with corrective lens
(concave) he will have to keep the book at distance
greater than 25 cm so that the image of book will be
formed by the concave lens at 25 cm and moreover,
the size of the book that appear to him is also
smaller. Therefore, the person prefer to remove his
spectacles while reading a book.
3
(ii) Hypermetropic person does not need spectacles to
see distant objects as he has the far point at infinity.
If such person uses spectacles (convex lens) to
see the distant objects, the image will be formed,
before retina due to increase in converging power
and hence the person cannot see distant object
distinctly. Therefore such persons prefers to remove
spectacles while looking at the sky.
1+1
Q. 6. How does the colour of the scattered light depend
on the size of the colloidal particles ?
3

[ 307
Ans. The colour of the scattered light depends on the size
of the scattering particles. Very fine particles having
size less than the wavelength of visible light mainly
scatter blue light of shorter wavelength of the
visible spectrum. The particles of relatively larger
size scatter light of longer wavelengths. The large
particles such as raindrops, dust and ice particles
scatter white light.
3
Q. 7. Dispersion is caused by refraction not by reflection.
Why ?
3
Ans. The reason is that for a given angle of incidence, the
angle of reflection is same for all the wavelengths of
white light while the angle of refraction is different
for different wavelengths.
3
Q. 8. What is Tyndall effect ? What is its causes ? Name
two phenomena observed in daily life which are
based on Tyndall effect.
5
Ans. Tyndall effect : When a beam of light is passed
through a colloidal solution, placed in a dark
room, the path of beam becomes illuminated
when observed through a microscope placed
perpendicular to the path of light. This effect is
called Tyndall effect.
1½
Cause of Tyndall effect : The size of the colloidal
particle is relatively larger than the solute particle
of a true solution. The colloidal particles first absorb
energy from the incident light and then scatter
a part of this energy from their surfaces. Thus,
Tyndall effect is due to scattering of light by the

 Frictional Electricity : It is the electricity produced by rubbing two suitable bodies and flow of electrons from one
body to other.
 Electricity : A fundamental form of energy observable in positive and negative forms that occurs naturally (as in
lightning) or is produced (as in a generator) and that is expressed in terms of the movement and interaction of
electrons.
		Positive and Negative Charges : The charge acquired by a glass rod when rubbed with silk is called positive
charge and the charge acquired by an ebonite rod when rubbed with wool is called negative charge.
		Charge Conservation : When a glass rod is rubbed on silk, the glass rod acquires positive charge. But it is not
created. The negative charges from glass rod are shifted to silk leaving a net positive charge on glass rod. The net
charge in them remains the same. So, charges are not created or destroyed but can be transferred from one place
to another or remain conserved.
 Coulomb : It is the SI unit of charge. One coulomb is defined as that amount of charge which repels an equal and
similar charge with a force of 9 × 109 N when placed in vacuum at a distance of 1 meter from it. Charge on an
electron = 1.6 × 10–19 coulomb.
		Conductor : A substance which allows passage of electric charges through it easily is called a conductor. A
conductor offers very low resistance to the flow of current. For example, Copper, Silver, Aluminium etc.
		Insulator : A substance that has infinitely high resistance does not allow electric current to flow through it. It is
called insulator.
		Electric Potential Energy : It is defined as the work required to be done to bring the charges to their respective
location against the electric field with the help of a source of energy. This work done gets stored in the form of
potential energy of charge.
		Ohm : It is the SI unit of resistance. A conductor has a resistance of one ohm if a current of one ampere flows
through it on applying a potential difference of 1 volt across its ends.
						

1 ohm =

		Resistor : A conductor which has some appreciable resistance is called a ‘resistor’.
		Resistivity : It is defined as the resistance offered by a cube of a material of side 1m, when current flows
perpendicular to its opposite faces. Its SI unit is ohm-metre (Wm).
		Resistivity,

r=

RA
L

		For a material irrespective of length and area, the resistivity is constant. It is otherwise called specific resistance
of the material. It is also defined as the resistance offered by a cube of a material of side 1m when current flows
perpendicular to the opposite faces.
 Rheostat is a device which changes the magnitude of current in the circuit, by changing the resistance. It is
connected in series in the circuit. It is also used as a potential divider in the circuit.
 Semiconductors : Materials having resistivity between that of an insulator and a conductor are called
semiconductors. They are used in making integrated circuits.
 Superconductors : These are certain materials that lose their resistivity at low temperature. Such materials
are called as superconductors. The phenomenon of complete loss of resistivity by substances below a certain
temperature is called superconductivity.
 Fuse Wire : The wire which melts, breaks the circuit and prevents the damage of various appliances in the
household connections. It is connected in series and its thickness determines the maximum current that can be
drawn. It is made of an alloy of Aluminium, Copper, Iron and Lead.

(b)

Now let one bulb the circuits get fused. Will
the rest of the bulbs continue to glow in each

High Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) Questions
Q. 1. How does the resistance of a wire depend upon its
radius ?
3
Ans. As R ∝ l/A,
R ∝ l/ r ∝ pr2, i.e. R ∝ l/r2.
3
Q. 2. Though same current flows through the electric line
wires and the bulb filament, yet only the filament
of bulb glows. Give the reason behind it.
3
Ans. The resistance of electric line wires is very, very less
than that of the filament of the bulb. Therefore, the
current through high resistance filament produces
more heat which makes it glow.
3
Q. 3. The heating elements of electric toasters and
electric irons are made of an alloy rather than a
pure metal. Why ?
3
Ans. The heating elements of electric toasters and electric
irons are made of an alloy rather than a pure metal
due to the following reasons :
(i) Alloys do not oxidise readily at high temperature.

(ii) Alloys have higher resistivity than their constituent
elements.
3
Q. 4. For domestic purposes, we connect the electrical
devices in parallel instead of connecting them
in series. What are the advantages of connecting
electrical devices in parallel ?
3
Ans. By connecting the electrical devices in parallel :
(i) Each device gets the full or same voltage.
(ii) Each device gets proper current depending on its
resistance.
(iii) If one device is switched off / on, other electrical
appliances remain unaffected.
That is why for domestic purposes we connect the
electrical devices in parallel instead of connecting
them in series.

Q. 5. (a) A large number of free electrons are present in
metals. Why is there no current in the absence of
electric field across it ?

B

A

Ans. (a) In the absence of an electric field, the motion of
the electrons in a metal is random. There is no net
flow of charge across any section of the conductor.
So no current flows in the metal.

(b) As R = , clearly, slope of V-I graph gives
I
resistance R. As graph B has a greater slope
than A, so graph B represent series combination
(higher resistance) and graph A represents parallel
combination (lower resistance).

Q. 6. A number of bulbs are to be connected to a single
source. Will they provide more illumination when
connected in parallel or in series ? Give reasons to
justify your answer and also list two advantages of
this type of arrangement.

[Board Term I, Set-43, 2012] 3
Ans. The bulbs will provide more illumination when
connected in parallel as each bulb will get the
required voltage/current and their illuminations
will be added. In case the bulbs are connected in
series, they will not get the required voltage and
may even not glow.
1
The bulbs should be connected in parallel because
each bulb will show its maximum power or total
resistance decrease hence greater current may be
drawn from the cell.
1
Advantages of parallel arrangement :
(i) Voltage across each device is same and it can take
current as per its resistance.

(ii) If one device is damaged, then others continue to
work properly.

Q. 7. Explain the following ;
(i) Why is tungsten used exclusively for filament of
electric lamps ?
(ii) Why are the conductors of electric heating devices,
such as bread toasters and electric iron made of an
alloy rather than a pure metal ?
(iii) Why is series arrangements not used for domestic
circuit ?
(iv) How does the resistance of a wire vary with its
area of cross section ?
(v) How many joules are there in one kilo watt hour ?
[NCERT, NCT-2014] 5
Ans. (i) Tungsten has a high melting point (3380°C). It
does not melt at high temperatures. It retains as
much of heat generated, so that it becomes very hot
and emits light.
(ii) Conductors of electric heating devices are made
up of alloys because alloys do not oxidise readily at
high temperatures, unlike metals. Also alloys have
a greater resistivity as compared to their constituent
pure metals.
(iii) Because if one component fails, the circuit is broken
and none of the other components will work. Also
components need currents of widely different
values to operate properly. But in a series circuit,
the current is constant throughout the electric
device.
(iv) Resistance is inversely proportional to the area of
cross-section of the wire. Thus, if the wire is thick,
then resistance is less. If the wire is thin, then
resistance is large.
(v) The commercial unit of electrical energy is kilo-watt
hour.
			 1 kilowatt hour = 1 kW × 1h
				 = 103 W × 3600s
				= 3.6 × 106 Ws.

Magnetic field ∝ No. of turns in the coil
Magnetic field is additive in nature i.e., magnetic field of one loop adds up to magnetic field to another loop. This is
because the current in each circular turn has some direction.
A coil of large number of turns closely wound on a hollow cylinder of insulated material or otherwise is called a
solenoid. The end of the solenoid having clockwise current will act as south pole-field enters into, while on the
other hand having anti-clockwise current will act as north pole-field comes out. Thus, a solenoid acts as a normal
magnet.
Permanent magnets are made of carbon steel, chromium steel, tungsten steel and some alloys like Alnico and
Nipermag. Alnico is an alloy of aluminium, nickel and cobalt.
When a material is placed inside a coil carrying current, it will get magnetised. A bunch of nails or an iron rod
placed along the axis of the coil can be magnetised by the current allowed to pass through the coil. Such magnets
are called electromagnets.
Ampere suggested that when a current I passes through a conductor of length l placed in a perpendicular magnetic
field B, then the force experienced is given by F = IBl sin q, where q is the angle between the length of the conductor
and magnetic field.

Stretch the thumb, fore finger and middle finger of your left hand such that they are mutually perpendicular. If fore

An electromagnet is a solenoid coil that attains magnetism due to the flow of current. It works on the principle of
magnetic effect of current.
The production of electric current due to relative motion between a conductor and a magnetic field is called
electromagnetic induction. Electric current produced due to this phenomenon is called induced current.
When the current flowing through a coil changes, then the current is induced in the coil itself. This phenomena is
called self induction.
Magnetic flux is defined as the product of the magnetic field and the area through which magnetic field passes
perpendicularly. φ = NBA, when field passes perpendicular to the plane of the coil. It is measured in weber. If B and
A are at angle θ, φ = NBA cos θ, where N is the number of turns.
If the current always flows in the same direction, it is called direct current. DC can be obtained from a cell or a
battery. The positive and negative polarities of DC are fixed.
If the current changes direction after equal intervals of time it is called alternating current. The positive and
negative polarities of AC are not fixed.
Connecting the outer frame of an appliance to earth to avoid any shock caused by fault or current leakage is called
earthing.
The coil having many turns used in electric motor or generator is called armature.
Fuse is a safety device commonly used in electric circuits. It is connected in the live wire.

Q. 5. A magnetic compass needle is placed in
the plane of paper near point A as shown
is Figure. In which plane should a straight
current carrying conductor be placed so that
it passes through A and there is no change is
the deflection of the compass ? Under what
condition is the deflection maximum and why ?
[NCERT Exemplar 2017]
Ans. In the plane of the paper itself. The axis of the
compass is vertical and the field due to the
conductor is also vertical. It could result in a dip of
compass needle which is not possible in this case
(dips result only if axis of compass is horizontal).
The deflection is maximum when the conductor
through A is perpendicular to the plane of paper
and the field due to it is maximum in the plane of
the paper.
Q. 6. A magnetic compass shows a deflection when
placed near a current carrying wire. How will
the deflection of the compass get affected if the

current in the wire is increased ? Support your
answer with a reason. [NCERT Exemplar 2017]

Ans. Fleming’s Left Hand Rule : The direction of force
which acts on the current carrying conductor
placed in a magnetic field is given by Fleming’s left
hand rule. It states that if the forefinger, thumb and
middle finger of left hand are stretched mutually
perpendicular and the forefinger point along the
direction of external magnetic field, middle finger
indicates the direction of current, then thumb
points along the direction of force acting on the
conductor.

Ans. (i) Take a battery (12 V), a variable resistance (or
a rheostat), an ammeter (0 - 5A), a plug key and
a long straight thick copper wire. Insert the thick
wire through the centre, normal to the plane of a
rectangular cardboard. Take care that the cardboard
is fixed and does not slide up or down.
Connect the copper wire vertically between the
points X and Y, in series with the battery, a plug
and key. Sprinkle some iron filings uniformly on the
cardboard. Keep the variable of the rheostat at a fixed
position and note the current through ammeter.
Close the key, So that current flows through the
wire. Ensure that the copper wire placed between
the points X and Y remains vertically straight.
Gently tap the cardboard for a few times. Observe
the pattern of the iron filings. You would find that
the iron filings align themselves showing a pattern
of concentric circles around the copper wire. This
represents the magnetic field around the currentcarrying conductor. The direction of magnetic field
changes on reversing the direction of current.

it. As a result galvanometer gives a deflection in
the reverse direction. (say towards right). 1½
		(c) If the bar magnet is held stationary inside the
coil, then there is no induced current in the
coil, because there is no change in magnetic
field through it. As a result, galvanometer does
not show any deflection.

Short Answer Type Questions-I
Q. 1. Explain the terms : Overloading and short-

circuiting.

[Board Term I, Set-36, 2012]

Ans. Overloading occurs when or two many appliances
of high power ratings are connected to a single
electric circuit and switched on simultaneously. As
a result, the circuit draws large current beyond its
capacity.
Short-circuiting takes place in domestic power
supply if the live wire and the neutral wire come
into direct contact, due to damage of insulation of
live wire.

electrical appliance ? Why should a fuse with
defined rating not be replaced by one with a
larger rating ?
[NCERT Exemplar 2017, KVS 2017]
Ans. Fuse is used for protecting appliances due to shortcircuiting or overloading. The fuse is rated for a
certain maximum current and blows off when a
current more than the rated value flows through it.
If a fuse is replaced by one with larger ratings, the
appliances may get damaged while the protecting
fuse does not burn off. This practice of using fuse of
improper rating should always be avoided.

force acting on the electron will be :
(a) to the right, (b) to the left, (c) out of the page,
(d) into the page.


Ans.

When a force conductor carrying current
is placed perpendicular to the direction of
magnetic field, the magnetic field acting on it
is given by Fleming’s left hand rule. Since the
direction of current is the same as that of the
motion of a positive charge, the direction ot force
acting on it when moving perpendicular to the
direction of magnetic field is the same as that
acting on a current-carrying conductor placed
perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field.

3

Obviously, the force acting on an electron is
opposite to that. Therefore in this case it is into
the page.

Q. 16. It is necessary to connect an earth wire to electric
appliances having metallic covers. Why? How
will you identify earth wire in household
circuit ? [Board Term I, Set-OQKPLGV, 2016]
Ans. The earth wire provides a low resistance
conducting path for the current. In case of any
leakage of current to the metallic body of any
appliance, the earth wire allows the current to flow
into the earth and user saved from electric shock.
Earth wire has green insulation.
		
[CBSE Marking Scheme, 2016]
Detailed Answer :
The earth wire is connected to a metallic plate deep
inside the earth. In this way, the metallic body of
appliance is connected to the earth, which provides
a low resistance conducting path for electric current.
Hence, any leakage of current to the metallic body
of appliance keeps the potential to that of earth.
The user might not get a severe electric shock on
touching such an appliance.
Earth wire has green insulation, so it can be
identified.

not possible.
3
Q. 2. The deflection of the compass needle increases as it
is moved towards the pole of a bar magnet. Why ? 3
Ans. The magnetic field due to a bar magnet is highest
near its two poles. Therefore, the force exerted by
the bar magnet on the compass needle is larger
in such a region. That is why the deflection of the
compass needle increases when it is moved towards
the pole of a bar magnet.

I. Fossil Fuels :
 Fuels developed from the fossils e.g., coal, petroleum.
 Take million of years to form.
 Available in very limited amount.
 These are non-renewable sources of energy.

[ 365

SOURCES OF ENERGY



India has about 60% share in the world reserved coal, that may last 250 years more at the present rate of consumption.

		In power stations, one needs energy to run turbines. Large quantity of fossil fuels like coal are burnt to produce
heat energy. This produces steam which is used to rotate turbines to produce electricity. The flow of energy is as
listed below :
		

Fossil fuels—Heat Energy—Mechanical Energy—Electrical Energy.



The energy of water flowing through rivers or stored in dam is another potential source of energy. It is also indirect
source of solar energy. It is the solar energy which recycles water in nature from oceans and the earth’s surface
through rain and snow. The energy of water flowing through rivers has been used for rotating the wheels of
watermills which are still operating in remote hilly areas.



The material contained in the bodies of plants and animals is called biomass. It act as a fuel. It includes waste from
tree and grass crops, forestry agricultural and urban wastes. The excreta of living organisms and their bodies after
death also contribute to the biomass.

I.					


The dead part of plants and trees and the waste materials of animals and man are called Biomass.

		

(1) Wood : It is a biomass and used as a fuel for a long time.

		

Disadvantages :

				

l Produces a lot of smoke on burning.

				

l Do not produce much heat.

		

(2) Charcoal : When wood is burnt in limited supply of air, then water and other volatile materials gets removed
and charcoal is formed.
Supply of O2
Wood Limited

→ Charcoal

		 Charcoal is better fuel then wood because :
		

(i)

It has higher calorific value than wood.

		

(ii) Does not produce smoke while burning.

		

(iii) It is a compact fuel, easy to handle and convenient to use.

		 (3) Cowdung : It is a biomass but it is not good to burn cowdung directly as fuel because :
				

l it produces lot of smoke.

				

l cowdung does not burn completely, produces lot of ash as residue.

				

l low calorific value.

				

lby making bio gas (or gobar gas) from cow dung, we get a smokeless fuel.

		

(4) Bio gas : It is produced in a biogas plant. Anaerobic micro organisms decomposes the complex compound of
the cow dung + water slurry. It takes few day for the decomposition process and generate gases like methane, CO2,
hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide. Bio gas is stored in the gas tank above the digester from which they are drawn
through pipes of use.

		

Alternate or Non-conventional Sources of Energy



Day by day, our demand for energy is increasing, so there is a need for another sources of energy.

Reasons for alternate source of energy
		

(i) The fossil fuel reserves in the earth are limited which may get exhausted soon if we use them at the current rate.

		

(ii) To reduce the pressure on fossil fuels making them last for a much longer time.

		

(iii) To reduce the pollution level and to save the environment.

I. Solar Energy :


Sun is the ultimate source of energy.



Energy obtained from the sun is called solar energy.
Solar constant = 1.4 KJ/s/m2



Outer edge of the earth receives solar energy equal to 1.4 KJ/s/m2 or 1.4 KW/m2 [1 KJ/s = 1 KW]



Electrical energy is one of the widely used energies. It is generated by harnessing different sources of energy. In
any conventional power plant, turbines of generators are rotated by using steam arrived by heating water from one
source of energy.



Indirectly or directly all forms of energy originate from the solar energy. Besides heat energy, ultraviolet, gamma
rays and visible light also come from solar energy.



Solar cell is a device which converts solar energy i.e., light energy directly into electricity. They are made up of
semi-conductors like–silicon, germanium and selenium.

Solar cell panel comprises of a large number of solar cells and can provide much higher power for many uses.
The blowing wind has energy which is called wind energy. Wind is associated with kinetic energy. Solar energy is
responsible for the blowing of the wind. The three factors which help in blowing of wind are :
		 (i) The uneven heating of equatorial region and polar region of earth by sun rays.
		 (ii) Rotation of earth.
		 (iii) Local conditions.
 Ocean Thermal Energy (OTE) : There is always a temperature difference between water at the surface and
at deeper level up to 20°C. This form of energy is called ocean thermal energy which can be converted into
electricity.
 Energy from oceans is also available in the form of sea-waves. Due to blowing of wind on the surface of ocean, very
fast sea-waves move on its surface. It has lot of kinetic energy due to high speed.
 The rise of ocean water due to attraction of moon is called ‘high tides’ whereas fall of ocean water is called ‘low
tides’. The tidal waves rise and fall twice a day. Tidal energy can be harnessed by constructing a tidal barrage or
tidal dam.
 The heat from inside the earth heats up the water below the surface. This hot water can be used under favourable
conditions as a source of energy. This energy with hot water below the earth is called geothermal energy.

Unit for energy is associated with electrons accelerated through a potential of 1 volt.
1 eV = 1.6 × 10–19 joule, 1 MeV = 1.6 × 10–13 joule.
According to Einstein, the mass and energy are inter-convertible. They are related by the relation E = mc2, where c
is the velocity of light. (3 × 108 ms–1).
When nuclear fission reaction takes place, it also releases neutrons which are capable of creating further fission. For
continuous production of energy, fission should be continuous. The neutrons released are made to bombard other
uranium nuclei to produce more fission. Such self-sustained reactions are called chain reactions.
In order to make a chain reaction possible there should exist sufficient 235U nuclei. The minimum mass of fissionable
material required in order to make a chain reaction possible is called critical mass.

allow infra-red radiations of higher wavelength.
Since the sun sends infra-red radiations of lower
wavelengths, these pass through the glass windows,
and gets trapped inside the car in the form of heat.
This heat or infra-red radiations can not pass out
and thus gets trapped in the car for longer time,
making it hot from inside.

explain with an example why we should worry
about our energy resources ?
[Board Term I, Set-L7ZSVLH, 2016]

370 ]

Oswaal CBSE Question Bank, SCIENCE, Class – 10

Ans. Energy used is dissipated in less usable form.
The energy used is consumed and cannot be used
again.
Example : Burning of candle → light + heat but
products cannot produce chemical energy (Or any
other example) [CBSE Marking Scheme, 2016] 3
Detailed Answer :
The law of conservation of energy states that energy
can neither be created nor be destroyed. But, it
can only be converted from one form to another.
Despite this fact, the world is facing energy crisis.
The reason behind it is that energy is converted into
non-usable forms.
Fossil fuels like coal, petroleum etc. are the sources
of energy which have accumulated in nature over
a long time and cannot be replaced. We should
worry about such sources because these sources of
energy are getting depleted and sooner or late, will
no longer be available to us.

Q. 3. Explain the term geothermal energy’. How can

it be exploited ? Though it is economical yet it is
not harnessed in most of the countries. Why ?
[Board Term-I, Set-1ZHNPNO, 2016]

374 ]
Ans. Geothermal energy is heat energy trapped in hot
regions called hot spots when molten rocks are
pushed upwards.
When underground water comes in contact with
hot spots steam is generated. Steam trapped
in rocks is routed through a pipe to a turbine to
generate electricity.
Very few commercially viable sites are available
where such energy can be exploited.
		
[CBSE Marking Scheme, 2016] 3
Detailed Answer :
The heat from interior of the earth can be utilised
as a source of energy under certain favourable
conditions that are created by natural processes.
This is known as geothermal energy.
Molten rocks formed in the deeper hot regions of
Earth’s crust are pushed upward and trapped in
certain regions due to geological changes. These
spots are called hot spots. Underground water
when comes in contact of hotspots, it gets converted
into steam due to heat of molten rocks (magma)
and remains trapped between the rocks, at high
pressure. This steam can be used to run turbines
connected to electric generators.

OUR
ENVIRONMENT

 Our Environment : Ecosystem, Environmental problems, ozone depletion, waste production and their
solution, biodegradable and non-biodegradable substances.

Quick Review
Everything that surrounds us is environment. It includes both living (biotic) and
TOPIC - 1
non-living (abiotic) components.
Ecosystem and Food Chain
 Interaction between these biotic and abiotic components form an ecosystem.
.... P. 383
 In an ecosystem living components depend on each other for their food which
give rise to food chains and food webs in nature.
TOPIC - 2
Biodegradable and Non Human activities lead to environment problems such as depletion of ozone

layer and production of huge amount of garbage.
and Global Warming.... P. 390
Ecosystem
 All the interacting organisms in an area together with the non-living constituents
of the environment form an ecosystem. E.g., forest, pond etc.
		 Types of ecosystem : It is of two types :
		 (a) Natural ecosystem : The ecosystem which exist in nature on its own. e.g., forest, lake, ocean.
		 (b) Artificial ecosystem : Man-made ecosystem are called artificial ecosystem. e.g., crop field, aquarium, garden.


Components of an ecosystem
Biotic components
(Plant, animals)

Abiotic components
(Air, water, land)
Producer
Herbivore

Consumer
Carnivore

Decomposers

Omnivore

Parasites

 Herbivores, carnivores, omnivores and parasites are the various type of consumers.
 Consumers are those organisms which depend upon the producers for food, either directly or indirectly by
feeding on other consumers for their sustenance. They are also called heterotrophs.
 Parasites are those organisms that live on (ectoparasites) or in (endoparasites) the body of another organism, i.e.,
host from which it obtain its nutrients, e.g., parasites of man includes fleas and lice.
 Decomposers are those micro-organisms that obtain energy from the chemical break down of dead organisms
or animals or plant wastes. Decomposers break down the complex organic substances into simple inorganic
substances that go into the soil and are used up once more by the plants.
 Food chain is sequence of organisms through which energy is transferred in the form of food by the process of
one organism consuming the other.
		
Examples :
		Grass

 Trophic levels are the various steps or levels in the food chain where transfer of food or energy takes place.
Producers are the first trophic level, herbivores are second trophic level, carnivores or secondary consumers are
third trophic level and large carnivores or tertiary consumers are the fourth trophic level.
 Food web is the network of various food chains which are interconnected at various tropic levels. Since an
organism can occupy position in more than one food chain, in a food web it occupies more than one trophic level.
 The flow of energy through different steps in the food chain is unidirectional. This means that energy captured
by autotroph does not revert back to the solar input and it passes to the herbivores.
Flow of energy between trophic levels


Flow of energy in a food chain is unidirectional.



Green plants capture 1% of sunlight and convert it into food energy.



10 percent law : Only 10% of energy is transferred to the next trophic level. The remaining 90% energy is used is life
processes (digestion, growth, reproduction etc.) by present trophic level.



Due to this gradual decrease in energy, food chains contain 3-4 trophic levels.



Biological magnification : The concentration of harmful chemicals increases with every next trophic level in a food
chain. This is called biological magnification.



Maximum concentration of such chemicals get accumulated in human bodies as human occupy the top level in any
food chain.



Ozone (O3) is an isotope of oxygen i.e., it is a molecule formed by three atoms of oxygen. Ozone performs an
essential function of shielding the surface of the earth from ultraviolet radiation of the sun.
O2 + O → O3



Ozone layer is a layer of the earth’s atmosphere in which most of the atmosphere’s Ozone is concentrated.



Ozone layer protects the earth from harmful radiations.



There are several reasons for depletion of ozone layer.



The foremost is the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The other factor responsible for ozone destruction is the
pollutant nitrogen monoxide (NO).

 When the harmful chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are released into the air, it accumulates in the upper
atmosphere and reacts with ozone resulting in reduction in thickness of the ozone layer.


Thus, the ozone layer in the atmosphere becomes thinner and gets depleted allowing more ultraviolet rays to pass
through it.



The Antarctic hole in ozone layer is caused due to chlorine molecules present in chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), that
are used by human being.

Garbage disposal


Improvements in lifestyle have resulted in accumulation of large amounts of waste materials.



Garbage contains following type of materials :

		 (a) Biodegradable wastes : Substances which can be decomposed by the action of micro-organisms are called
biodegradable wastes.
		

E.g., fruit and vegetable peels, cotton, jute, dung, paper, etc.

		

(b) Non-biodegradable wastes : Substances which cannot be decomposed by the action of micro-organisms are called
non-biodegradable wastes.

		

E.g., plastic, polythene, metals, synthetic fibres, radioactive wastes, pesticides etc.

		

Micro-organisms release enzymes which decompose the materials but these enzymes are specific in their action that's
why enzymes cannot decompose all the materials.

Some methods of waste disposal
		

(a) Biogas plant : Biodegradable waste can be used in biogas plant to produce biogas and manure.

		

(b) Sewage treatment plant : The drain water can be cleaned in sewage treatment plant before adding it to rivers.

		

(c) Land fillings : The wastes are buried in low lying areas and are compacted by rolling with bulldozers.

		

(d) Composting : Organic wastes are filled in a compost pit and covered with a layer of soil, after about three months
garbage changes to manure.

		

(e) Recycling : Non-biodegradable waste are recycled to make new items.

		 (f)

Reuse : It is a conventional technique to use an item again e.g., newspaper for making envelops.

OUR ENVIRONMENT

Know the Terms


Environment : It is the sum total of all external conditions and influences that affect the life and development of an
organism, i.e. the environment includes all the physical or abiotic and biological or biotic factors.



Biodegradable substances are those substance which are broken down into simpler, harmless substances in nature
in due course of time by the biological processes such as action of micro-organisms.



Non–biodegradable substances are those substance which cannot be broken down into simpler, harmless
substances in nature. These substances may be in solid, liquid or gaseous form and may be inert and accumulate
in the environment or may concentrate in the food chain and harm the organisms.



Ecosystem : It is the structural and functional unit of biosphere, comprising of all the interacting organisms in an
area together with the non–living constituents of the environment. Thus, an ecosystem is a self sustaining system
where energy and matter are exchanged between living and non-living components.



Producers : Those organisms which produce food by photosynthesis i.e. organisms which can make organic
compounds like sugar and starch from inorganic substances using the radiant energy of the sun in presence of
chlorophyll.



Consumers : Those organisms which depend upon the producers for food, either directly or indirectly by feeding
on other consumers for their sustenance. Consumers therefore, feed upon those below it in a food chain and are
called heterotrophs.



Decomposers : They are those micro-organisms that obtain energy from the chemical breakdown of dead
organisms or animals or plant wastes. These micro-organisms are decomposers as they breakdown the complex
organic substances into simple inorganic substances that go into the soil and are used up once more by the plants.



Food Chain : It is the sequence of organisms through which energy is transferred in the form of food by the process
of one organism consuming the other. It shows the relationship of producer and consumer i.e. 'who eats whom'.
Thus, it is a series of organisms taking part at various biotic level from the producer and ends in consumer.



Trophic Levels : These are the various steps or levels in the food chain where transfer of food or energy takes
place. The producers or autotrophs are the first trophic level, the herbivores or primary consumers are the second
trophic level, the carnivores or secondary consumers are the third trophic level and the large carnivores or tertiary
consumers are the fourth trophic level of the food chain.



Food Web : It is the network of various food chains which are interconnected at various trophic levels. Since, an
organism can occupy position in more than one food chain, in a food web it occupies more than one trophic level.



Flow of Energy : The flow of energy through different steps in the food chain is unidirectional. This means that
energy captured by autotroph does not revert back to the solar input and it passes to the herbivores. It moves
progressively through various trophic level

(ii) Decomposers are recyclers of life materials,
returning materials to the system for use by living
organisms.
1+1
Q. 11. Why are only 4 or 5 trophic levels present in

each food chain ?

Ans. There is only 10% flow of energy from one trophic
level to the next higher level. The loss of energy at
each step is so great that very little usable energy
remains after four or five trophic levels. Hence, only
4 to 5 trophic levels are present in each food chain. 2
Q. 12. Look at the following figures. Choose the

correct one and give reason for your answer.

[KVS 2017]

Fig 'A'

Fig 'B'

Ans. Fig. “A’’ is correct. In a ecosystem, the number of
individuals at producer level is maximum. This
number reduces at each successive level. Therefore,
the shape is a pyramid with broader base and
tapering apex. On an average 10% of the food
changes into body mass and is available for the next
level of consumers.

Q. 13. Aquarium required regular cleaning whereas

lakes normally do not. Why ?


[KVS 2017]

Ans. Normally a lake has more diverse forms of life and
hence a larger number of food chains. The leads to
natural cleaning. Thus, the ecosystem is more stable.
The aquarium has a very limited number of food
chains and unable to sustain itself. But, sometimes
there is excessive growth of algae in lake. Then it
also needs to be cleaned.

Short Answer Type Questions-II
Q. 1. What is an ecosystem ? List its two main

components. We do not clean natural ponds
or lakes but an aquarium needs to be cleaned
regularly. Why is it so ? Explain.
[NCERT Exemplar] [Board Term II, O.D. Set II, 2015]
Ans. Ecosystem is the structural and functional unit
of biosphere, comprising of all the interacting
organisms in an area together with the non–living
constituents of the environment.
Two main components of Ecosystem are :
(i) Biotic component
(ii) Abiotic component
An aquarium is an artificial and incomplete
ecosystem compared to pond or lakes which are
natural, self–sustaining and complete ecosystem
where there is a perfect recycling of materials.
We need to clean of aquarium because of the :
(i) absence of natural decomposer.
(ii) stagnancy of water.
1+1+1
Q. 2. What are biotic factors ? Give any two examples.
Ans. Biotic factors are the living components of the
environment which interact with each other as
well as with the abiotic factors of the ecosystem.
Example : Plants and animals.
2+½+½
Q. 3. What is meant by food chain ? “The number of
tropic levels in a food chain is limited.” Give
reason to justify this statement.
[Board Term II, Foreign Set I, III]
Ans. Food chain is a simple representation of energy
flow in nature.
For example : A rat eats grains,a snake eats a
rat,which in turn, is eaten by an eagle.
In a food chain, the number of trophic levels are
limited to 4-5. This is because according to 10%
law of energy transfer, only 10% of energy passes
from one trophic level to next. Thus the amount
of energy decreases with successive trophic levels.
After five trophic levels, existence of organisms
would become impossible with such negligible
amount of energy.
2+1
Q. 4. Explain the phenomenon of ‘Biological
Magnification’. How does it affect organisms
belonging to different trophic levels particularly
the tertiary consumers ?
Ans. Biological magnification refers to the process of
increase in the concentration of a toxic chemical
with increasing trophic level in a food chain.
1
Harmful or poisonous substance such as DDT
sprinkled to kill pests on plants enter the food
chain. The plants absorb these harmful chemicals
from soil along with water and minerals. They enter
the food chain at producer level and then transfers
to the next trophic level. The tertiary consumers get
more higher levels of these chemicals.
2
Q. 5. Define Ecosystem. Briefly describe the two
types of ecosystem.

(3 marks each)

Ans. Ecosystem is the structural and functional unit
of biosphere, comprising of all the interacting
organisms in an area together with the non-living
constituents of the environment.
1
Ecosystem are of two types :
(i) Natural Ecosystem : The natural ecosystems are
terrestrial (land) as well as aquatic. The common
example of land ecosystem are forest, grassland,
desert, etc. The common examples of aquatic
ecosystem are ponds, lakes, rivers, ocean, etc.
1
(ii) Human made or Artificial Ecosystem : These
ecosystems are made by human beings. The
common examples are crop fields, gardens, parks,
aquarium, etc.
1
Q. 6. What are consumers ? Name the four categories
into which the consumers are further grouped.
[DDE 2017]
Ans. Organisms that feed directly or indirectly on
producers and cannot synthesize their own food
from inorganic sources are called consumers.
2
Herbivores, Carnivores, Omnivores and Parasites
are various categories of consumers.
1
Q. 7. What are trophic levels ? Give an example of a
food chain and state the different trophic levels
in it.
Ans. Trophic levels are different steps of a food chain.
A trophic level is the level of species in an
ecosystem on the basis of the source of nutrition
such as producers, primary consumers, secondary
consumers etc.
The producers form the first trophic level as they
manufacture food.
The primary consumers form the second trophic
level, the secondary consumers form the third,
and the tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic
level.

(Herbivore)		(Carnivore)
		1st Trophic level 2nd Trophic level 3rd Trophic level 1
Q. 8. Why there is a progressive decline in the
amount of energy at each trophic level ?
Ans. At every trophic level, large amount of energy
is lost in form of heat for maintaining metabolic
activities and lost as heat. The amount of heat lost
is generally 90 percent and the amount of energy
retained is available from previous trophic level to
the next. The decline in energy level leads to :
2
(i) Lesser number of organisms in each trophic level.½
(ii) Limited number of trophic level in food chains. ½
Q. 9. Mention any three significance of a food chain.
Ans. Significance of a food chain :
(i) It helps in understanding the food relationship
and interactions among various organisms in an
ecosystem.

[ 389

Q. 13. “Our food grains such as wheat and rice,

the vegetables and fruits and even meat are
found to contain varying amounts of pesticide
residues.” State the reason to explain how and
why it happens ?

[Board Term II, Delhi Set I, 2015]

[Board Term II, Delhi Set I, III, 2014]

[Board Term II, Outside Delhi Set I, III, 2014]

Ans. A large number of pesticides and chemicals are
used to protect our crops from pests and diseases.
Some of these chemicals are washed down into the
soil, while some enter in the water bodies. From the
soil, they are absorbed by plants along with water
and minerals; and from water bodies, they are
taken up by aquatic plants and animals. This is how
these chemicals enter the food chain. Because these
chemicals cannot decompose, they accumulate
progressively at each trophic level. As the food
chain proceeds, the concentration of pesticides
also increases. This increase in the concentration of
harmful chemicals with each step of the food chain
is called biomagnification. That is why food grains,
such as wheat and rice, vegetables, fruits and even
meat are found to contain pesticide residue.
3

Q. 10. "Energy

flow in food chains is always
unidirectional". Justify this statement. Explain
how the pesticides enter a food chain and
subsequently get into our body.
Ans. (i) In a food chain the energy moves progressively
through the various trophic levels and is no longer
available to the organisms of the previous trophic
level/ energy captured by the autotrophs does not
revert back to the solar input.
1
(ii) Pesticides used for crop protection when washed
away/down into the soil/water bodies absorbed by
plants/ producers.

(iii) On consumption they enter our food chain and
being non-biodegradable, these chemicals get
accumulated progressively and enter our body. 1
[CBSE Marking Scheme, 2015]
Q. 11. Give reason to justify the following :

(i) The existence of decomposers is essential in a
biosphere.


(ii) Flow of energy in a food chain is unidirectional.
[Board Term II, Delhi Set I, 2016]
Ans. (i) The existence of decomposers is essential in
a biosphere because they breakdown complex
organic substances into simple inorganic substances
that can be absorbed by the plants.
Thus, decomposer :

(iii) Crop fields are man-made and some biotic and
abiotic components are manipulated by humans. 1

Q. 14. Why is only 10% of energy made available to

the next trophic level when green plants are
eaten by herbivores ?
[DDE 2017]
Ans. When green plants are eaten by herbivores, a great
deal of energy is lost in the form of heat to the
environment.
1
Some amount goes into digestion and in doing
work and the rest goes towards growth and
reproduction.
1
The remaining is only an average of 10% of the food
eaten that is turned into its own body and made
available for the next level of consumers.

Q. 15. Calculate the amount of energy available to lion

in the following food chain if plants have 20,000
J of energy available from the sun.
Plant → Deer → Lion

Ans. According to 10% Law,
Plants have 20,000 J energy available.
Plants transferred their 10% energy to deer i.e.
			

20,000 ×

Q. 12. Write the harmful effects of using plastic bags,
on the environment. Suggest alternatives to
plastic bags.
[Board Term II, O.D. I, 2013]
[Foreign Set 2017]
Ans. Plastic bags are non-biodegradable wastes, they
are not degraded, they begin to stink, emitting foul
gases, spoil the beauty of places and contaminate
soil, water and air with toxins.
Cloth bags are used instead of plastic bags because
they are stronger, more durable and washable. 1+1
Q. 13. Why do enzymes which break down carbohydrates
in foods does not break down coal ?
Ans. Enzymes are specific in their action. Specific
enzymes are needed for the breakdown of a
particular substance.
So, enzymes which digest carbohydrates in food are
specific for acting only on the carbohydrates and
hence cannot act on other substances like coal.

Q. 14. In some states of our country there is a ban on
the use of polythene bags for shopping. Why ?
List three advantages of using jute or cloth bags
over polythene bags.

[Board Term II, Delhi Set III, 2014]
Ans. There is a ban on the use of polythene bags for
shopping in some states of our country because
they cannot be degraded naturally by the
action of microorganisms. Because of their nonbiodegradability, they stay in the soil for a long time
and continue to poison it with toxic by-products
that keep leaching from them. Also, they do not

allow water to seep in, as they are waterproof.
These polythene bags when accidentally eaten by
stray animals can harm them and can even cause
their death.
The three advantages of using jute or cloth bags
over polythene bags are as follows :
(i) Cloth or jute bags are environment-friendly; they
are biodegradable.
(ii) They are renewable and can be easily recycled.
(iii) They have more strength than polythene bags
because they are thick and can be used again and
again.
½x4
Q. 15. Why is Government of India imposing a ban
on the use of polythene bags ? Suggest two
alternatives to use these bags and explain how
this ban is likely to improve the environment.
[Board Term II, Delhi Set I, 2014]
Ans. Government of India is imposing a ban on the use
of polythene bags because they cannot be degraded
naturally by the action of microorganisms. Because
of their non-biodegradability, they stay in the
soil for a long time and continue to poison it with
toxic by-products that keep leaching from them.
Also, they do not allow water to seep in, as they
are waterproof. These polythene bags, when
accidentally eaten by stray animals, can harm them
and can even lead to their death.
Jute and cloth bags can be used in place of polythene
bags.
They are environment-friendly as they are
biodegradable.
They are renewable and can be easily recycled.
Thus, using jute and cloth bags will help to reduce

chain. The food chain which you would suggest,
is advantageous in an another aspect. How ?
Ans. Vegetarian food chain will be suggested in case of
entry of non-biodegradable toxic chemical into the

(5 marks each)

food chain.
Non-biodegradable chemical gets concentrated
at every trophic level by the process of biological
concentration. As the concentration increases with
the number of trophic level in a food chain, man
will get high concentration of the chemical in non–
vegetarian food chain than in a vegetarian food
chain. Example :
Vegetarian food chain :
		Plants → Man
		5 PPM

		Vegetarian food chain is advantageous in terms
of energy available to man because it has less
number of trophic level. As 90% of energy is lost
to the environment, at every level lesser number of
trophic level will result in lesser energy loss. 3 +2

High Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) Questions
Q. 1. Why do harmful chemicals concentrate as we go
up in a food chain ?
[DDE 2017] 3
Ans. Harmful chemical concentrate in the trophic levels
of food by the process of biological concentration or
bio-magnification. The process of entry of a non–
biodegradable chemical into a food chain and its
getting accumulated at successive trophic levels,
reaching the maximum quantity in the top most
level is biological magnification.
3
Q. 2. With the knowledge of energy transfer in
the food chain, man can place himself at an
advantageous position in the food chain.
Explain.
5
Ans. When man places himself close to the producers,
he gets more calories. Lower the distance from
producer level, lesser the amount of calories
available. This is due to the fact that at every trophic

level 90 percent of energy is lost to the environment.
e.g.,

Q. 3. Why are green plants called producers ?
3
[DDE 2017]
Ans. Green plants are also called producers because only
they can synthesize organic food from inorganic
raw materials with the help of solar energy in the
process of photosynthesis. This food is not only
used by green plants but also by other organisms
called consumers.

Q. 4. (i) What is biological magnification ?
(ii) If the concentration of DDT is 0·2 ppm in water of
lake, what would be its likely concentration in fish
in the food chain ?
Plankton → Fish → Fish eating birds.
5
Ans. (i) Biological Magnification : The increase in the
concentration of a chemical per unit weight of the
organisms with the successive rise in tropic level. 2
(ii) Water → Plankton → Fish → Fish eating bird
(0.2ppm.) (5.0ppm) (240ppm)
Concentration in Fish would be approximately 240
ppm.
3
Q. 5. Why are bacteria and fungi called decomposers ?3
Ans. Most of the bacteria and fungi are saprophytes. They
obtain their nourishment from organic remains.
For this they secrete digestive enzymes over the
remains. The remains are converted into soluble
absorbable form. This results in decomposition of
organic matter. Therefore, bacteria and fungi are
called decomposers.
3
Q. 6. The use of pesticide DDT is discouraged since this
chemical is found in human body. How does this
chemical enter our body ?
3
Ans. DDT enters through the food chain into the human
body by the process called biomagnification
or biological concentration. DDT is a non–
biodegradable chemical that remains toxic in the
soil for a long time, absorbed by the plants and
thus, enters into the food chain. It gets accumulated
at every successive trophic level reaching maximum
quantity in the top–most trophic level.
3
Q. 7. Explain why there are greater chances of
accumulation of harmful chemical in the body of
human beings.
3
Ans. Man is at the top of most food chains and hence,
due to biological magnification there are greater
chances of accumulation of harmful chemicals in
the body.

manufacture.
3
Q. 9. Why are some substances biodegradable and some
non-biodegradable ?
5
Ans. Substance which can be degraded and disposed off
naturally by saprophytic organisms or decomposers
are called biodegradable, e.g., organic remains,
garbage, sewage, livestock waste. Substances which
cannot be degraded by saprophytes are known
as non-biodegradable. They are mostly manmade articles like pesticides, plastic, polythene
etc. Biodegradable articles are formed naturally in
biosphere. Decomposer organisms feed on them
by secreting digestive juices and absorbing the
solubilised substances. Biogenetic nutrients are
released in the process called mineralization.

Q. 10. “Damage to the ozone layer is a cause of concern.”
Justify the statement. Suggest any two steps to
limit this damage.
5
Ans. Cause of Concern : Ozone layer present in the
stratosphere has thinned out by about 8% over the
equator and more so over the Antarctica where a big
ozone hole appears every year. This has increased
the level of UV-B radiations reaching the earth by
15-20 %. These radiations are causing increased
number of skin cancers, cataracts and reduced
immunity in human beings. These causes increased
incidence of blindness of animals, death of young
ones, reduced photosynthesis, higher number of
mutations and damage to articles.

MANAGEMENT
OF NATURAL
RESOURCES

Quick Review
 Natural Resources : Anything in the environment ‘which can be used’ is
called natural resource. For example, soil, air, water, forests, wildlife, coal and
petroleum.
Types of Resources

Exhaustible

Inexhaustible

These are present in limited quantity
E.g., Coal, petroleum.

These are present in unlimited quantity
E.g., Air, water.

 Coliform is a group of gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria that are found in
human intestine. Their presence in water is an indicator of contamination by disease-causing micro-organisms
indicating faecal pollution. It includes Salmonella and Escherichia coli.
 Largely untreated sewage such as garbage and excreta are dumped into Ganga. Pollution is also caused by
human activities such as bathing, washing and immersion of ashes or unburnt corpses.
 Industries also contribute in Ganga’s pollution by loading chemical effluents and making the water toxic, killing
aquatic organisms.
 Ganga Action Plan is a massive multi-core project launched in 1985, which has been undertaken to clean the
excess pollution from river Ganga.
 Management of Natural resources
		 Three R’s to save the environment :
3R's

REDUCE
Use Less

1. Switching off
unnecessary lights
and fans.
2. Repairing leaky taps.

RECYCLE
Segregate waste that can
be recycled

REUSE
Use again

Plastic, glass, metal items
can be recycled instead of
synthesizing or extracting
new ones.

Instead of throwing
things away, they can
be used again.

3. Not wasting food.

 Sustainable Management
		
Management of resource wisely so they meet current basic human needs while preserving them for the needs of
future generations.
 The management of natural resources require :
(a) Long term perspective so that these will last for generations to come.
(b) Ensure equitable distribution of resources so that all economic sections benefit from these resources.
(c) Safe disposal of waste.
 The objective of sustainable development is to provide the economic well being to the present and the future
generations and to maintain a healthy environment and life support system.
 pH stands for ‘Potential of Hydrogen’. It is negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion concentration in
moles per litres.

 The acidic and basic character of aqueous solutions can be described in terms of hydrogen ion and hydroxide ion
concentration.
 Pollutant is the substance that causes a harmful change in the environment, thereby producing adverse effects on
living organisms. Some of the common pollutants include pesticides, industrial wastes and emissions, exhaust
fumes from vehicles and sewage.
 Biodiversity is the existence of a wide variety of species of plants, animals and micro-organisms in a natural
habitat within a particular environment or of genetic variation within a species.
 Forest is a ‘biodiversity hotspot’ because it is an area where number of species or range of different life form
exists.
 Wildlife means all those naturally occurring animals, plants and their species which are not cultivated,
domesticated and tamed.
 Conservation is the sensible use of the earth’s natural resources in order to avoid excessive degradation and
betterment of the environment.
 Afforestation is the practice of transforming an area into forest, usually when trees have not grown there, and
involves three types of forestry programmes.
 Social and environmental forestry involves raising of trees for firewood, fodder, agricultural implements for the
benefits of rural and tribal community.
 Agro-Forestry is an absolute commercial forestry developed to fulfil the need of various forest-based industries.
It is done on the fallow land or free-grazing lands.
 Urban forestry involves growing of ornamental trees along roads, vacant lands and common parts of urban
areas.
 Large reservoirs of petroleum have been preserved by nature for millions of years between porous rocks beneath
the earth.
 Non-renewable energy sources are energy sources which cannot be replaced easily when they get exhausted and
are also called conventional sources of energy. They are used traditionally for many years and take millions of
years to form fossil fuels.
 The fossil fuels, coal and petroleum get exhausted and their combustion pollutes our environment, so a judicious
use of these resources is necessary.
 Necessity of judicious use of coal and petroleum : The fossil fuels, coal and petroleum will get exhausted and their
combustion pollutes our environment, so a judicious use of these resources is necessary.
 When combustion takes place, oxides of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur are formed.
 Carbon monoxide is formed instead of carbon dioxide if there is insufficient air.
 The oxides of sulphur, nitrogen and carbon monoxide are poisonous at high concentrations.
 Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which leads to global warming.
 Water for all
(a) Water is the basic necessity for all terrestrial forms of life.
(b) Rain is an important source of water.
(c) Irrigation methods like dams, tanks and canals have been used in various parts of India.
 Dams
		 Dams ensure the storage of adequate water for irrigation and are also used for generating electricity.
		 Various dams have built on rivers to regulate the flow of water.
E.g., (a) Tehri Dam — On river Ganga
(b) Sardar Sarovar Dam — On river Narmada
(c) Bhakra Nangal Dam — On river Satluj
 Advantages of Dams
(a) Ensures adequate water for irrigation.
(b) To generate electricity.
(c) Continuous supply of water to cities and towns.
 Disadvantages of Dams
(a) Social problems :
(i) Many tribals and peasants are displaced and rendered homeless.
(ii) They do not get adequate compensation or rehabilitation.
(a) Environmental problems :
(i) Deforestation
(ii) Loss of biodiversity
(iii) Disturb ecological balance
(c) Economic problems :
(i) Huge amount of public money is used.
(ii) No proportionate benefit to people.

Q. 21. List three problems which arise due to
construction of big dams. Suggest a solution of
these problems.

[Board Term II, Delhi Set II, 2014]
Ans. The three types of problems that arise because of
the construction of big dams are :
(i) Environmental problems : Construction of dams
across rivers leads to deforestation, which results
in the loss of biodiversity. This disturbs the natural
ecosystem.
Solution : We should plant more and more trees.
(ii) Social problems : Construction of dams involves
the building of large reservoirs. In some cases,
constructing a reservoir may result in the flooding
of nearby towns and villages. A large number of
people get displaced as a direct consequence of
the construction of reservoirs. In such cases, the
government has to rehabilitate the people living in
these areas, which, in itself, is a huge task.

Solution : The government should first relocate the
people to a safer place where they can continue with
their daily work. If, in case, the life of the people
gets affected, the government should provide
proper compensation to those people.
(iii) Economic problems : Construction of dams requires
a huge amount of monetary investments.

effects on the environment. As people become
more affluent they demand more goods and
services, the production of these goods and services
in turn damages the environment. At the same time
these affluent people are able to spend money to
restore the environmental damage done by their
consumerism.
