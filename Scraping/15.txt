Q. 30. What do you understand by amphoteric nature of proteins?
Ans. A chemical, like protein, carrying both positive and negative charge is called
amphoteric.
Q. 31. Define isoelectric point.
Ans. Isoelectric point of the amino acid is defined as the point at which a molecule exist as
zwitter ion with no net charge.

Ans. The inactive state of enzyme is called zymogen or proenzyme.
Q. 36. What are ligases?
Ans. Ligases are the enzymes that join two substrate molecules.

Q. 37. Define allosteric modulation or feedback inhibition.
