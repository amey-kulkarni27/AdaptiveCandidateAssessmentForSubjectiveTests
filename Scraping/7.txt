Short Answer Type Question-1
Q.1. In how many groups are body glands classified?
Ans. The body glands are classified into two main groups:
(i) Exocrine glands: The secretions of these glands are carried by ducts to a particular
organ for some metabolic activity. e.g., salivary glands, liver etc.
(ii) Endocrine glands: These glands have no ducts and their secretions get absorbed into
the immediate surrounding blood circulation to reach specific organs to initiate a particular
metabolic change. e.g. pituitary, thyroid.
Q. 2. How fall and rise in blood calcium stimulates secretion of parathyroid?
Ans. Parathyroid is under the feedback control of blood calcium level. A fall in blood calcium
stimulates them to secrete parathormone. A rise in blood calcium inhibits parathormone
secretion from them.
Q. 3. Why pituitary gland is called as master gland?
Ans. (i) The pituitary is called "Master Endocrine Gland" because of number of hormones it
produces and the control it exercises over other endocrine gland.
(ii) It itself is under the control of the releasing- hormones secreted by the hypothalamus of
the brain. Thus, there is a chain of orders : the hypothalamus directs the pituitary output,
which controls the secretion of hormones by other endocrine glands.
Q. 4. What is Addison's disease? What are its symptoms?
Ans. Hyposecretory disorder of the adrenal cortex or destruction of adrenal cortex in
diseases such as tuberculosis leads to deficit of both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.
This condition is known as Addison's disease. Persons with Addison's disease tend to lose
weight, their blood glucose and sodium levels drop and potassium levels rise.
