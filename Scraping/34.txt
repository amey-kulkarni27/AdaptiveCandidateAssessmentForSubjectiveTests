are found in pisces, amphibians, reptiles and birds.
Q. 14. Which are the largest of all types of leucocytes ? Mention its function.
Ans. Monocytes are the largest of all types of leucocytes they are phagocytic in nature and
engulf bacteria and cellular debris.
Q. 15. How does lymph maintains the volume of blood ?
Ans. As soon as the volume of blood reduces in the blood vascular system, the lymph rushes
from the lymphatic system to the blood vascular system.
Q. 16. What is the function of sino-atrial node ?
Ans. Sino-atrial node acts as a pace-maker and initiates the heart beat.
Q. 17. How can be erythroblastosis foetalis avoided in a pregnant woman immediately
after the delivary of the first child ?
Ans. The condition of erythroblastosis foetalis can be avoided by administering anti-Rh
antibodies to the pregnant woman immediately after the delivery of the first child.
Q. 18. Where does the cardiac impulse originate?
Ans. Cardiac impulse originates in the sino-atrial node (SAN).
Q. 19. Where is the basian valve located ?
Ans. The right atrium receives the opening of coronary sinus which is known as the basian
valve.
Q. 20. What is the function of pericardium ?
Ans. The pericardium protects the heart from shocks and mechanical injuries and also allows
free movement of the heart.
Q. 21. What are the constituents of lymphatic system ?
Ans. The constituents of lymphatic system are lymphatic capillaries, lymphatic vessels,
lymphatic nodes and lymphatic ducts.
Q. 22. What are lacteals ?
Ans. The lymphatic capillaries of intestine absorbs the digested fats. They are milky in
appearance a are called as lacteals.
Q. 23. What stimulates the waves of contraction in atria and which way the blood
moves ?
Ans. The atria contracts due to a wave of contraction, stimulated by the SA node. The blood
is forced into the ventricles as the bicuspid and tricuspid valves are opened.

Q. 24. What is haemocoel ?
Ans. The body cavity of the cockroach is filled with blood or haemolymph, referred to as
haemocoel.
Q. 25. Give the names of the blood groups which are universal donor and universal
acceptor
Ans. Universal donor blood group is O and universal acceptor blood group is AB.
Q. 26. What does Rh-factor means in a blood group ?
Ans. Rh-factor is a type of blood protein which was found for the first time in the blood of the
Rhesus monkey. It is an antigen or a protein occurring on the surface of the red blood cells.
Q. 27. What is the average rate of heart beat in humans?
Ans. The average rate of heart beat is 72 times minute.
Q. 28. Write two forms of lymphocytes.
Ans. The two forms of lymphocytes are: B-lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte.
Q. 29. Why do we consider blood as a connective tissue ?
Ans. Because it connects various parts of the body and contains plasma and the formed
elements such as RBCs, WBCs, blood platelets etc.
Q. 30. What is joint diastole?
Ans. During blood circulation when both the atria and ventricles are in relaxed phase, it is
called joint diastole.
Q. 31. What is heamolysis ?
Ans. Heamolysis is the destruction of RBCs.
Q. 32. Where does the cardiac impulse originates ?
Ans. The cardiac impulse originates from Sino-atrial node at the top of right atria.
Q. 33. What does the T wave in a normal electrocardiogram indicates ?
Ans. The T-wave represents the return of the ventricles from excited to the normal state i.e.,
repolarization takes place. It marks the end of systole.
Q. 34. What do you understand by stroke volume ?
Ans. During a cardiac cycle, each ventricle pumps out approximately 70 ml. of blood which is
called the stroke volume.
Q. 35. Mention the important functions of the systemic circulation ?
Ans. The systemic circulation provides nutrients O 2 and other essential substances to the
tissues and takes CO 2 and other harmful substances away for elimination.

Q. 36. What is hypertension ?
Ans. The increase in blood pressure is called hypertension.
Q. 37. What is atrial pulse ?
Ans. It is the wave of distention that passes along the arteries immediately following the
ventricular systole.
Q. 38. Why lymphatic circulation takes place very slowly ?
Ans. It is because lymphatic circulation occurs due to squeezing action of surrounding
muscles and not by the heart.
Q. 39. What is coronary circulation ?
Ans. The flow of oxygenated blood from the ascending aorta to the heart muscles and the
return of deoxygenated blood from the heart muscles to the right atrium is called coronary
circulation.
Q. 40. What is a heart block ?
Ans. It is a condition in which impulses are interrupted at any point along the conducting
system of the heart. Thus, impulses do not follow the normal conduction pathway.
Q. 41. What is the importance of ECG ?
Ans. The importance of ECG is that it gives accurate information about the heart. It is of
great diagnostic value in cardiac diseases.
Q. 42. From where does the hepatic portal system brings the blood ?
Ans. Hepatic portal system brings blood from the alimentary canal, pancreas and spleen to
the liver.
Q. 43. What is anaemia?
Ans. It is the condition in which there is reduced number of erythrocytes with a reduced
amount of haemoglobin. It is a deficiency disease caused by the deficiency of iron.
Q. 44. What do QRS and T represent in this figure ?

[KVS 2012-13]

Ans. QRS represents ventricular depolarisation while T wave represents ventricular
repolarization.
Q. 45. Expand ECG.
Ans. Electrocardiogram.

[KVS 2013-14]

Q. 46. A cardiologist observes an enlarged QR wave in the ECG of a patient? What
does this indicate?
Ans. The enlarged QR wave indicates myocardial infarction.
