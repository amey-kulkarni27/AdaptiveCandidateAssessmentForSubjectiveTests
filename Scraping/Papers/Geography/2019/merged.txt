for resources which sustain them.” Examine the
statement.
OR

beings on nature for resources which sustain them.
The physical environment for such socientes becomes
the “Mother Nature”. Nature is powerful source,
worshipped, revered and conserved. Human beings
afe directly dependent on nature for resources
which sustain them. They create possibilities with
the resources obtained from the environment.
The human actvities create cultural landscape. The
imprints of human activities ate created everywhere;
health resorts on highlands, huge urban sprawls,
fields, orchards and pastures in plains and rolling hills,
ports on the coasts, oceanic routes on the oceanic
sutface and satellites in the space. Nature provides
opportunities and human beings make use of these
and slowly nature gets humanized and starts bearing
the imprints of human endeavour.
OR
Human beings interact with their physical
environment with the help of technology. It is
not important what human beings produce and
create but it is extremely important ‘with the help
of what tools and techniques do they produce and
create’. Technology indicates the level of cultural
development of society. Human beings were able
to develop technology after they developed better
understanding of natural laws.
(i) The understanding of concept of friction and
heat helped us discover fire.

(ii) Understanding of the secrets of DNA and
genetics enabled us to conquer many diseases.
(iti) The laws of aerodynamics were used to develop
faster planes.
(iv} Knowledge about nature is extremely umportant
to develop technology and technology loosens the
shackles of environment on human beings.

evolved after 1850. For e.g, a large number of towns
were developed as administrative headquarters, ¢.g,,
Chandigarh, Bhubaneswar, Gandhinagar, Dispur,
etc. and as industial centres such as Durgapur, Bhilai,

Sindri, Barauni, etc. Some old towns also developed
as satellite towns around metropolitan cities such as

ate found to develop near mining centres. They
favour high‘density of population. For e.g., Durgapur
and Jamshedpur.
(ii) Urbanisation : Urban settlements offer better
standard of living, medical facilities, well developed
transport networks and better employment
opportunities etc. These facilities encourage rural
to urban migration resulting in high density of

prospect in the production of such resources that
will provide sustained and envitonmental fnendly
energy io the future:
(i} The large expanse of deserts and the coastlines
are an ideal site for the generation of wind energy.
The largest wind farm cluster in India is located in
Tamilnadu,
(ii} Bio gas is an important non conventional
energy resource in rural areas. Shrubs, animal and
agricultural wastes are used to produce biogas. The
use of biogas for domestic consumption in rural
areas can reduce the burning of fuel wood and thus
reduce the feeling of trees.
(iii) The long coastline of India is an ideal site for
the peneration of tidal energy. It can be used for
generation of electricity which is non- polluting and
a sustainable source of energy.
OR
Conservation of mineral resources is essendal for

the development of India.
(i) They are unevenly distributed over space. There
is inverse relationship in quantity and quality of
minerals,

replenished immediately at the time of need.
(iii) Minerals are an integral part of our life. They
are used for various purposes. They are used in the
manufacturing of a tiny pin to large constructions
e.g., automobiles, roads, railway tracks, etc. Hence

conservation 1s necessary for continuous use, The

presence of resources and minerals contributes a
lot to the economic growth of the country. It also
creates a lot of revenue for the government to put
to better use, It makes transportation faster.
20. “Indian railways network is one of the longest
networks of the world and has contributed a
lot to the growth of the economy.” Support the

following way :
(i) It has connected the remote rural areas to the
urban markets. This helps the farmers to carry their
apticultural products to the urban centres,
(ii) Railways help to carry bulky raw materials like
coal from the mining centres to the industrial units.
(iii) It has helped to connect the rural areas to
the urban centres. This has helped to generate
employment opportunittes for the rural people.

People can easily move from place to place in search
of employment or for business purposes.

‘productive irrigation’.
Answer : Protective irmgation is done in order
to protect the crops from adverse effects of soil
moisture deficiency and to provide soil moisture to
maximum possible area.
The objective of productive irrigation 1s to provide
sufficient soil moisture in the cropping season to
achieve high productivity and in this the water
input per unit area of cultivated land is higher than
protective irrigation.
5. Evaluate the utility of ‘Rural Roads’.
[1]
Answer : Rural roads are useful because :
(i) The link the remotest part of the country with
each other.

15. How to human beings pollute the water through
industrial and agricultural activities ? Explain.
[2’42t2742=5]

Answer : Human beings pollute the water through
industrial, apricutural and cultural activites. Among
these activities, industry is the most significant
contributor.

Industries produce several undesirable products
including industrial wastes, polluted waste water,
chemical residuals, numerous heavy metals, etc. Most
of the industrial wastes are disposed off in running
water or lakes. Consequently, poisonous elements
reach the reservoirs, rivers and other water bodies,
which destroy the bio-system of these waters. Major

water polluting industries are leather, pulp and paper,
textiles and chemicals.
Various types of chemicals used in modern
agriculture such as inorganic fertilisers, pesticides and
herbicides are also pollution generating compounds.
These chemicals are washed down into rivers, lakes

and tanks. These chemicals also infiltrate the soil to
reach the groundwater. Fertiliser includes an increase
in the nitrate content of surface waters.

quality of water resources in India are :
(i) Direct dumping of various foreign substances
from industries such as chemical residual, numerous
heavy metals, industrial wastes, in water bodies

making then useless and unfit for vatious purposes.
(ii) Various kinds of agricultura] chemicals
(inorganic fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides etc.) are
washed down in rivers, which naturally affect the
quality of water.
(iii) Addition of loads of untreated sewage into
rivers declines the quality of water and severely
harms aquatic life and system.

6. Explain any five important characteristics of
[5]
‘mixed farming’ practised in the world.
Answer : Mixed farming is a type of agriculture
which involves both crops and livestock. Mixed
farming yields fairly high agricultural returns because
of efficient methods of farming, excellent transport
systems, and proximity to the urban markets and rein
ability of precipitation.
The cool-moist summer and comparatively mildmoist winters promote the growth of hay crops and
grasses in many undulating tracts and low flatlands.
The pastures remain fresh all the year round and
large flocks of sheep and herds of cattle are grazed.
The five important characteristics of mixed farming
pracused in the world :
(i) Equal emphasis is laid on crop culavanon.
(ii) Animals like cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry
provide the main income with crops like wheat,
barley, dats, maize, fodder, root crops.
(iii) Mixed farms are moderate in size.

Four geographical factors that influence the
distribution of population in the world:
(i) Available of water: It is the most important
factor for life. So, people prefer to live in areas where
fresh water is easily available.

and gentle slopes. This is because such areas are
favourable for the production of crops and to build
roads and industries.

or cold deserts are uncomfortable climage, but where
there is not much seasonal variation, attracts more
people.
