High Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) Question
Q.1. How can you explain that plant cell act as an osmotic system ?
Ans. (i) A plant cell has a cell membrane and cell wall as its boundary. The cell wall is freely
permeable to water, hence it is not barrier to movement.
(ii) In plant cells, the cells usually contains a large central vacuole, whose contents, the
vacuolar sap, contribute to the solute potential of the cell.
(iii) The cell membrane and the membrane of the vacuole, the tonoplast, together are
important determinants of movement of molecules into the cell.
Q. 2. What is stomatal periodicity? What are the categories of stomata?
Ans. Stomatal periodicity is the rate of opening and closing of stomata during day and night.
Stomata usually open during day and close during night. There are three categories of
stomata :
(i) Barley or cereal type : They are dumb-bell shaped. The stomata usually open during the
day for a few hours.
(ii) Leuceme or alfalfa type : They open during day and close during night under mesophytic
conditions. In succulents, the stomata remain closed during the day. They open only during
night.
(iii) Potato Type : Under mesophytic conditions, the stomata can remain open through day
and night but close down for different periods and at various times under less water
availability.
