13,Q.14. What are the economic implications of globalisation? How has globalisation impacted on India with regard to this particular dimension? ,"Ans. The most important feature of process of economic globalisation is greater economic flows among different countries of the world. Some of this is voluntary and  some forced by international institutions and powerful countries. Flow or exchange can take various forms: Commodities, Capital, people and ideas, Globalisation has involved greater trade in commodities across the globe; the restrictions imposed by different countries on allowing the imports of other countries have been reduced. The restrictions on movement of capital across countries have also been reduced. In operational terms, it means that investors in the rich countries can invest their money in countries other than their own, including developing countries, where they might get better return. Globalisation has also led to the flow of ideas across national boundaries. The spread of internet and computer related services is an example of that. Consequences of globalisation are not the same in every country. They may vary. Economic globalisation has created an intense division of opinion all over the world. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. They point out that it is likely to benefit only a small section of the population while impoverishing those who were dependent on the government for job and welfare (education, health, sanitation, etc.) They have emphasised the need to ensure institutional safeguards or creating ‘social safety nets’ to minimise the negative effects of globalisation on those who are economically weak. Advocates of economic globalisation argue that it generates greater economic growth and well-being for larger section of the population when there is de-regulation. They also advocate that economic globalisation is inevitable and it is not wise to resist the march of history. More moderate supporters of globalisation says that globalisation provide a challenge that can be responded to intelligently without accepting it uncritically. Interdependence and integration between governments, business and ordinary people in different parts of the world has increased as a result of globalisation. In 1991, responding to a financial crisis and to the desire for higher rates of economic growth, India embarked on a programme of economic reforms that has sought increasingly to deregulate various sectors including trade and foreign investment. It is not possible to say how good this has been for India, the ultimate test is not high growth rates as making sure that the benefits of growth are shared so that everyone is better off."
14,Q.15. Do you agree with the argument that globalisation leads to cultural heterogeneity? ,"Ans. Yes. Globalisation influence our culture upto an extent. Globalisation affect us in our home, in our home, in what we eat, drink, wear and indeed in what we think. Globalisation leads to the rise of a uniform culture or what is called homogenisation. The rise of a uniform culture is not the evolution of a global culture. This is imposition of Western culture on the rest of the world. US hegemony can be seen on different cultures. The popularity of a burger or blue jeans, some argue, has a lot to do with the powerful effect of the American way of life. Thus, the culture of the politically and economically dominant society leaves its imprint on a less powerful society, and the  world begins to look more like the dominant power wishes is to be. McDonaldisation of the world is a clear example of increasing effect of American culture. Culture is a dynamic concept. All culture accept outside influences all the time. These changes simple enlarge our choices, and sometimes they modify our culture without overwhelming the traditional. The Burger is added on to our food choices. In the same way Blue jeans can go well with the homespun khadi kurti. The outcome of outside influence is a new combination that is unique, a Khadi kurta worn over jeans, interestingly this clothing combination has been exported back to the country that gave us blue jeans so that it is possible to see young Americans wearing a Kurta and jeans. While cultural globalisation is a facet of globalisation, the same process also generate precisely the opposite effect. It leads to each culture becoming more different and distinctive. This phenomenon is called cultural heterogenisation. This is not to deny that there remain differences in power when cultures interact but instead more fundamentally to suggest that cultural exchange is rarely one way."
15,Q.16. Explain any four consequences of globalisation. ,"Ans. (i) Political: Globalisation affect ‘traditional conceptions of state sovereignty’. It result in an erosion of state capacity, that is, the ability of government to do what they do. It encourages more minimalist states in place of welfare state.

However it withdraws from many of its earlier welfare functions directed at economic and social well being. (ii) Economic: Economic concept of world is a part of chain of globalisation. Economic gloabalisation play a very important role in the world’s politics. Economic globalisation involve many international institutions like World Bank and International monetary fund. Both of these institutions play a very important role in determining economic policies across the world. Yet, globalisation must not be viewed in such narrow turns. Economic globalisation involves many factors other than these international institutions. (iii) Cultural: The consequences of globalisation are not confined only to the sphere of politics and economy. Globalisation affect us in our home, in what we eat, drink wear and indeed in what we think. It shapes what we think are our preferences. The cultural influence of globalisation leads to the fear that this process poses a threat to cultures in world. It does so, because globalisation leads to the rise of a uniform culture or what is called ‘cultural homogenisation’. The rise of a uniform culture is not the evolution of a global culture. Thus, global culture is the imposition of western culture on the rest of the world. The popularity of burger or blue jeans has a lot to do with the powerful influence of the American way of life. (iv) Economic: Globalisation encourages different opinion all through the world. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. They point out that it is likely to benefit  only a small section of the population while impoverishing those who were dependent on the government for job and welfare (education, health, sanitation, etc.) They have called for a halt to force economic globalisation, for the poor within these countries.
