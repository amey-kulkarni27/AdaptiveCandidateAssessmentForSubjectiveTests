0,Q.1. What makes the European Union a highly influential regional organisation? ,"Ans. Following are the factors that make the European union a highly influential regional organisation: (i) Establishment of peace and tranquility: It became clear that war can never prove to be a step in the direction of country’s development. Prosperity and peace can be established by maintaining tranquillity and helping others. This was the objective of EU and it also succeeded in this. (ii) Challenge to US hegemony: US hegemony was established after the disintegration of Soviet Union, Organisations that can control US hegemony were required. EU was established and it was made strong so that they don’t have to bend in front of powers like America and China. The EU has emerged as an organisation that is economically, politically and militarily stable. (iii) Economic development: The EU is the world’s biggest economy with a GDP of more than US $12 trillion 2005, which is slightly larger than that of US. Its share of world trade is three times larger than that of the US. Its currency, Euro can pose a threat to the dominance of US dollar. Its economic power gives it an influence over America and China. (iv) Political and diplomatic powers: The EU also has strong political and diplomatic influence. This has enabled the EU to influence some US policies, such as the current US position on Iran’s nuclear programme. Its use of diplomacy, economic investments, and negotiations rather than coercion and military force has beeneffective as in the case of its dialogue with China on human rights and environmental degradation. (v) Military power: Militarily, the EU’s combined armed forces are the second largest in the world. Its total spending on defence is second after the US.

1,Q.2. How did European countries fire their problems after the Second World War? Discuss the steps taken which led to the establishment of the European Union.,"Ans. European leaders were worried as they were unable to decide whether to restart old confrontations or to bring out positive reforms to improve international relationship. The second world war had shattered many of the assumptions and structures on which the European states had based their relations. America extended massive financial help  for reviving Europe’s economy under what was called the ‘Marshall Plan’ in 1948. Western countries were made clear that they would definitely have to face a huge destruction if they continue to fight amongst themselves. The incident of monopoly of a communist government in Czechoslovakia in February 1948 made this clear. The Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) was established in 1948 to channel aid to the West European states. ‘The Council of Europe’ established in 1949, was another step forward in political cooperation. The process of economic integration of European capitalist countries proceeded step by step leading to the formation of the European Economic Community in 1957. The Collapse of the Soviet bloc put Europe on a fast track and resulted inthe establishment of the European Union in 1992. The foundation was thus laid for a common foreign and security policy, cooperation on justice and home affairs and the creation of a single currency. It has its own flag, anthem, founding date, and currency. It also has some form of a common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations."
2,Q.3. Name the pillars and objectives of the ASEAN Community. ,"Ans. Countries of South-East Asia were under pressure of colonialism before the Second World War. The colonialism was of European countries like France, Britain and Holland. These countries, even after their independence had to suffer from miseries like poverty, illiteracy, scarcity of food, economic backwardness and formation of nation. They had to suffer from the hegemony of a single superpower after the end of Cold War. Bandung summit and NAM didn’t prove successful in promoting unity in Asia and third world countries. In this condition, five countries of South-East Asia namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand by signing the Bangkok Declaration in 1967, established Association for Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN took step forward to form ASEAN community based on the following three pillars in 2003: 1. ASEAN security community: ASEAN security community was based on the conviction that outstanding territorial disputes should not escalate into armed confrontation. By 2003, ASEAN has several agreements in place by which member state promised to uphold peace, neutrality, cooperation, noninterference, and respect for national differences and sovereign rights. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), established in 1994, is an organisation that carries out coordination of security and foreign policy. 2. ASEAN Economic Community: ASEAN still remains principally an economic association. While the ASEAN region as a whole is a much smaller economy compared to the US, the EU and Japan, its economy is growing much faster than all these. This accounts for the growth in its influence on both, in the region and beyond. The objectives of the ASEAN Economic Community are to create a common market and production base with ASEAN states and to aid social and  economic development in the region. ASEAN has focussed on creating a Free Trade Area (FTA) for investment, labour and services. 3. Regional and Cultural Community: ASEAN is rapidly growing into a very important regional organisation.
