0,Q.1. Explain any three environmental concerns in global politics. ,"Ans. Environmental concerns in global politics: (i) Cultivated area in world is limited and there is less scope to expand it. It is also a matter of concern that a substantial portion of existing agricultural land is losing fertility and are over-harvested. (ii) Issues related to access safe water and sanitation is very important. According to UNDP report, 1.2 billion people in developing countries have no access to safe water and 2.6 billion have no access to sanitation. (iii) For ecological balance, natural forests are important environmental concerns in global politics. Ecological degradation may affect climate change and it may affect biodiversity on land. (iv) A steady decline in the total amount of ozone in the earth’s stratosphere poses a real danger to ecosystems and human health. (v) The Coastal waters are becoming increasingly polluted largly due to landbased activities. It may cause deterioration in the quality of marine environment."
1,Q.2. What is meant by ‘Common but differentiated responsibility’? How could we implement the idea?  Or ‘States have Common but different responsibilities towards environment’. Substantiate your answer with a suitable example.  Or Explain ‘Common but different responsibilities’. How and where has this been pressurised? ,"Ans. On the issue of ‘Environmental Protection’, the developing countries agree that ecological degradation is a product of industrial development undertaken by advanced countries. Thus responsibilities of its compensation should be a priority. This argument  was accepted in the Rio Declaration at the ‘Earth Summit’ in 1992 and is called the principle of ‘Common but differentiated responsibilities’. The relevant part of the Rio Declaration says that ‘States shall cooperate in the spirit of global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity of Earth’s ecosystem, in view of the different contributions of global environmental deterioration, states have common but differentiated responsibilities. The developedcountries acknowledge the responsibilities that they bear in the international pursuit of sustainable development in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technological and financial resources they command’. The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also provides that the parties should act to protect the climate system on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities."
2,Q.3. Explain indigenous people and their rights with respect to India.,"Ans. The indigenous people bring the issues of environment, resources and politics together. The UN defines indigenous populations as comprising the descendants of peoples who inhabited the present territory of a state at the time when persons of a different culture or ethnic origin arrived there from other parts of the world and overpowered them. Indigenous people today live more in conformity with their particular social, economic, and cultural customs and traditions than the institutions of the country of which they now form a part. In the context of the world politics, the common interest of approximately 30 crore indigenous people spread throughout the world including India, like other social movements, indigenous people speak of their struggles, their agenda and their rights. The indigenous voices in the world politics call for the admission of indigenous people to the world community as equals, indigenous people occupy areas in Central and South America, Africa, India and Southeast Asia. In India, the description ‘Indigenous People’ is usually applied to the scheduled tribes, who constitute nearly 8 per cent of the population of the country. With the exception of small communities of hunters and gatherers, most indigenous population in India depend for their subsistence primarily on the cultivation of land. For Centuries, if notmillennia, they had free access to as much land as they could cultivate. It was only after the establishment of the British colonial rule that areas, which had previously been inhabited by the Scheduled Tribe Communities were subjected to outside forces. Although they enjoy a constitutional protection in political representation, they havenot got much of the benefits of development in the country. In fact, they have paid a huge cost for development since they are the single largest group among the people displaced by various development projects since independence.Issues related to the rights of the indigenous communities have been neglected in domestic and international politics for very long. During the 1970s, growing indigenous leaders from around the world aroused the world a sense of common concern and shared experience. The World Council of Indigenous peoples was formed in 1975. The council became subsequently the first of 11 indigenous NGOs to receive consultative status in the UN. "
3,Q.4. Describe any three steps taken by the Indian Government to check the environmental degradation. [CBSE (AI) 2015],"Ans. Steps taken by the Indian government to check the Environmental Degradation: (i) National Auto-fuel policy: Indian National Auto Fuel Policy mandates cleaner fuels for vehicles. (ii) Energy Conservation Act: The Energy Conservation Act passed in 2001, outlines initiatives to improve energy efficiency. The Electricity Act of 2003 encourages the use of renewable energy. (iii) National Mission on Biodiesel: The Indian Government is also keen to launch a National Mission on Biodiesel, using about 11 million hectares of land to produce Biodiesel, and India has one of the largest renewable energy programmes in the world."
4,Q.5. Write a note on Sacred Groves in India.,"Ans. Protecting nature for religious reasons is an ancient practice in many traditional societies, Sacred groves means parcels of uncut forest vegetation, Sacred groves in India are in the name of certain deities or natural ancestral spirits. As a model of community-based resource management, groves have lately gained an attention in conservation towards this. The sacred groves can be seen as a system that informally forces traditional communities to harvest natural resources in an ecologically sustained fashion. Some researches believe that sacred groves hold the potential for preserving not only the biodiversity and ecological functions, but also cultural diversity. Sacred groves represent a rich set of forest preservation practices and they share characteristics with common property resource systems. Their size ranges from clumps of a few trees to several hundred acres. Traditionally, sacred groves have been valued for their embodied spiritual and cultural attribute. Hindus commonly worshiped natural objects, including trees and groves. Many temples have originated from sacred groves.Deep religious admiration and veneration for nature, rather than resource scarcity, seems to be the basis for the long-standing commitment to preserving these forests. In recent years, however, expansion and human settlement have slowly encroached on sacred forests. In many places, the institutional identity of these traditional forests is fading with the advent of new national forest policies. A real problem in managing sacred groves arises when legal ownership and operational control are held by different entities. The two entities mean the states and the community, vary in their policy norms and underlyingmotives for using the sacred groves."
5,Q.6. ‘There is a difference in the approach towards environment between the countries of the North and the South.’ Explain the statement with reference to the Earth Summit (1992) and the Kyoto Protocol (1997)?  ,"Ans. The Global south believes that global north is responsible for much of the environmental degradation as most of the developments and industrialisation have taken place in the north only. Their contention is that they are still on the path of development and, therefore, should not be subjected to the same restrictions. Countries of the north havea larger responsibility of ecological conservation. This principle was accepted at the Rio Summit 1992 and is popularly called ‘common but differentiated responsibility’. The Kyoto Protocol, which is based on the principles of UNFCCC 1992, also sets targets for industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions."
6,Q.7. What is resource geopolitics? Explain with an example.,"Ans. Resource geopolitics is all about who get what, when, where and how one gets the resources? Resources have provided some of the key means and motives of global European power expansion. They have also been the focus of inter-state rivalry. Western geopolitical thinking about resources has been dominated by the relationship of trade, was and power at the core of which were overseas resources and maritime navigation. Since sea power itself is rested on access to timber, naval timber supply became a key priority for major European powers from the 17th century onwards. The critical importance of ensuring uninterrupted supply of strategic resources, in particular oil, was well established during both the First World War and the Second World War. Throughout the cold war, the industrialised countries of the north adopted a number of methods to ensure a steady flow of resources. These included the deployment of military forces near exploitation sites and along sea-lanes of communication, the stockpiling of strategic resources, efforts to prop up friendly governments in producing countries, as well as support to multinational companies and favourable international agreements. Traditional western strategic thinking remained concerned with access to supplies, which might be threatened by the Soviet Union. A particular concern was western control of oil in the gulf and strategic minerals in Southern and Central Africa. After the end of the cold war and the fragmentation of the Soviet Union, the security of supply continues to worry government and business decision with regard to several minerals, in particular, radioactive materials. However, oil continues to be the most important resource in the global strategy. The global economy relied on oil for much of the 20th century as a portable and imperative fuel. The immense wealth associated with oil generates political struggles to control it, and the history of petroleum is also the history of war and struggle. Now here is this more obviously the case than in West Asia and Central Asia. West Asia, specifically the Gulf region, accounts for about 30 per cent of global oil production. But it has about 64 per cent of the planet’s known resources and it therefore the only region able to satisfy any substantial rise in oil demand. Saudi Arabia has a quarter of the world’s total reserves and it is single largest producer. Iraq’s known resources are second only to Saudi Arabia’s. And since substantial portions of Iraqi territory are yet to be fully explored, there is a fair chance that actual reserve might be far larger. The United States, Europe, Japan and increasingly India and China, which  consume this petroleum, are located at a considerable distance from the region. It is said that America always want to control the oil region of Iraq."
7,Q.8. Define the ‘Indigenous People’ and highlight any two threats to their survival.  Or Who are indigenous people? Describe any four problems of the indigenous people. [CBSE (AI) 2015],"Ans. Indigenous People The UN defined indigenous populations comprising of the descendants of people who inhabited the present territory of a country at the time when persons of a different culture or ethnic origin arrived there from other parts of the world and overcome them. Threats to their Survival (i) The indigenous people in the world demand to be treated as equal. They appeal to governments to come to terms with the continuing existence of indigenous nations as enduring communities with an identity of their own. (ii) The loss of land which also means the loss of an economic resource base is the most obvious threat to the survival of indigenous people. (iii) Although they enjoy a constitutional protection in political representation, they have not got much of the benefits of development in the country. They have paid a huge cost for development, since they are the single largest group among the people displaced by various developmental projects since independence.  "
