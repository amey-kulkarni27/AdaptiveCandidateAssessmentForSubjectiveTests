5,Q.6. Write the importance of the UN in unipolar world.,"Ans. With the disappearance of the Soviet Union, the US stands as the only superpower. Its military and economic power allow it to ignore the UN or any other international organisation. Secondly, within the UN, the influence of the US is considerable. As the single largest contributor to the UN, the US has unmatched Financial power. The fact that the UN is physically located within the US territory gives it additional influence. The power of the US and its veto power the US can stop any moves that it finds annoying or damaging toits interests or the interest of its friends and allies. The UN is not therefore a great balance to the US, Nevertheless, in a unipolar world in which the US is dominant, only the UN can initiate the talks between the US and various countries on different issues. UN provides an arena in which it is possible to modify US attitudes and policies. UN does provide a space within which argument and policies are heard and compromises and concessions can be shaped. The UN is an imperfect body, but without it the world would be worse off. Given the growing connections and independence, it is hard to imagine how more than seven billion people would live together without an organisation such as the UN."

Or Keeping in view the changed scenario, highlight any four steps taken by the member countries in 2005 to make the UN more contemporary. ","Ans. The Question of UN membership is a serious one. As the UN completed 60 years of its existence, the heads of all the member-states met in September 2005 to celebrate the anniversary and review the situation. The leaders in this meeting decided that the following steps should be taken to make the UN more relevant in the changing context. 1. Creation of a peace building commission. 2. Acceptance of the responsibility of the international community in case of failure of national governments to protect their own citizens from atrocities. 3. Establishment of a Human Rights Council (Operational since 19th June, 2016)  4. 5. 6. 7.  Agreements to achieve the millennium Development Goals. Condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Creation of Democracy Fund. An Agreement to wind up the Trusteeship Council.  It is not hard to see that these are equally contentious issues for the UN. What should a peace building commission do? There are many number of conflicts all over the world. Which ones should it intervene? Is it possible or even desirable for it to intervene in each and every conflict? Similarly, what is the responsibility of the international community in dealing with atrocities? What are human rights and who should determine the levelof human right violations and the course of action to be taken when they are violated? How realistic is it for the UN to achieve any ambitious set of goal such as those listed in millennium Development goal? Can there be agreement on a definition of terrorism? How shall the UN use funds to promote democracy? Given that so many countries are still part of the developing world. How can we expect the UN to intervene in situation like this? Would that require a change in its jurisdiction? All these matters became a subject of debate because most of the member states of the UN are developing. Can a solution be expected from these states? This will depend upon time."
