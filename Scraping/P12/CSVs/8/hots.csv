Only military comes under threat. 4. It is concerned with preventingwar, balance of power and formingalliances.  Non-traditional policy 1. Non-traditional notions of securitygo beyond military threats to includea wide range of threats and dangersaffecting the conditions of humanexistence. 2. Whole human existence comesunder threat. 3.

"What are the choices available to a state when its security is threatened, according to traditional security perspective? ","In the traditional conception of security, the greatest danger to a country is from military threats. The source of this danger is another country which by threatening military action endangers the core values of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. Agriculture, trade, business and industries of the region of war are affected adversely. Quite often, ordinary women and men are made targets of war to break their support to the war. In responding to the threat of a war, a government has three basic choices: 1. To surrender 2. To prevent the other side from attacking by promising to raise the costs of war to an unacceptable level; 3. To defend itself when war actually breaks out so as to deny the attacking country its objectives."
Distinguish between the internal and external notion of traditional security. [CBSE (AI) 2015],"Internal notion of traditional security: (i) Internal military conflicts.  (ii) Separatist movements: Internally, these states feared threats from separatist movements which wanted to form independent states. Sometimes, both external and internal threats submerged. This was because a neighbour might aid and abet internal separatist movements leading to tension between the two neighbouring states. (iii) Internal wars: Internal wars now account for more than 95% of the armed conflicts all over the world. There has been a steep rise twelve times in the number of civil wars, between 1946 and 1991 the highest jump in over 200 years. External notion of traditional security: (i) Danger to a country from military threats The source of such a security threat emerges from another country which, through its military action, threatens the core values of sovereignity, independence and territorial integrity. Military action even endangers the life of ordinary residents of a country. In a war, it is highly unlikely that only soldiers would die or be hurt. In all the likelihood, men and women, who are ordinary citizens and soft targets are made victims in a war, to break their support for the war. (ii) Deterrence, defence and balance of power Governments may even make the choice of surrender when actually in a war, but this may not be promoted as a country’s defence policy. Security policy, is hence, concerned with preventing war, which is known as deterrence, and with limiting or ending war, which is called defence. (iii) Alliance building as components of traditional security An alliance is a coalition of countries to deter or defend themselves unitedly against any possible military attack. Most alliances are formal written treaties based on a clear identification of potential threatening countries. Countries form military alliances to revitalise their effective power strength against other possible military alliance threats. (Any two points)"
Nuclear weapons as deterrence or defence have limited usage against contemporary security threats to states. Explain the statement. ,"Non-traditional notions of security go beyond military threats to include a wide range of threats and dangers affecting the conditions of human existence. These threats are poverty, epidemic, global warming, etc. Military attack causes threat not only the country but also affects whole human existence. Hunger, disease and natural disasters kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined. When war was considered as the greatest threat condition to the security, it occurred due to nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are of no use in front of these threats at present. They cannot contribute in any way to solve them."
Rapid environmental degradation is causing a serious threat to security. Do you agree with the statement? Substantiate your arguments.  ,"Human is rapidly destroying environment for his development but is causing a serious threat to country. Ecological balance is disturbed due to indiscriminate cutting of trees. Threats to human beings involve water pollution, air pollution, land pollution and noise pollution. Global warming is the consequence of increasing temperature whichis causing temperature of sea to rise. For example, due to global warming, a sea level rise of 1.5–2.0 metres would flood 20 percent of Bangladesh, inundate most of the Maldives, and threaten nearly half the population of Thailand."
How do per capita income and population growth affect the economic disparity in the world? Suggest any two ways to reduce economic disparity between the poor and the rich at the global level. [CBSE (AI) 2016],"Per Capita income is calculated by dividing the area’s total income by its total population in a particular year. The rise in population causes the income to be divided among more people thereby decreasing the per capita income. SO for a country to grow economically, its income should increase more than its population growth. Income disparity can be decreased in global scale by: (i) There should be a control on population growth through family planning and other means. This would allow for a balanced growth in per capita income and equal distribution of income and wealth. (ii) There should be means to increase total income. This would allow for more income to be distributed among people thereby increasing per capita income and allow people to equally prosper (with wealth and income)."
‘Epidemic is a big threat to the world’. Explain the statement.,"The threat to human security is from epidemic. Health epidemics such as HIVAIDS, bird-flu, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have rapidly spread across countries through migration, business, tourism and military operations. One country’s success or failure in limiting the spread of these diseases affects infections in other countries. By 2003, an estimated 4 crore people infected with HIV-AIDS worldwide, two-thirds of them in Africa and half of the rest in South Asia. In NorthAmerica and other industrialised countries, new drug therapies dramatically lowered the death rate of HIVAIDS in the late of 1990s. But these treatments were too expensive to help poor regions like Africa where it has proved to be a major factor in driving the region backward into deeper poverty. Other new and poorly understood diseases such as ebola virus, hantavirus, and hepatitis C have emerged, while old diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, dengue fever and cholera have mutated into drug resistant forms that are difficult to treat. Epidemics among animals have major economic effects. Since the late 1990s, Britain has lost billions of dollars of income during an outbreak of the  mad-cow disease, and bird flu shut down supplies of poultry exports from several Asian countries. Such epidemics show the growing interdependence of states making their borders less meaningful than in the past and emphasise the need for international cooperation."
"Looking at the Indian scenario, what type of security has been given priority in India, traditional or non-traditional? What examples could you cite to substantiate the argument? ","India faces both type of security threats, traditional and non-traditional. So, it does not give priority to any threat. It considers both the threats equally dangerous. Arguments: 1. The foremost component was strengthening India’s military capabilities because it has been involved in conflicts with its neighbours-Pakistan in 1947-48, 1965, 1971 and 1991 and China in 1962. Since it is surrounded by nuclear-armed countries in the South Asian region, India’s decision to conduct nuclear tests in 1998 was justified by the Indian government in terms of safeguarding national security. India first tested a nuclear device in 1974. 2. The third component of Indian security strategy is geared towards meeting security challenges within the country. Several militant groups from areas such as the Nagaland, Mizoram, the Punjab and Kashmir among others have, from time to time, sought to break away from India. India has tried to preserve national unityby adopting a democratic political system, which allows different communities and groups of people to freely articulate their grievances and share political power. 3. India’s security strategy has been to strengthen international norms and international institutions to protect its security interests. India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, supported the cause of Asian solidarity, decolonisation, disarmament, and the UN as a forum in which international conflicts could be settled. India also took initiatives to bring about a universal and non-discriminatory non-proliferation regime in which all countries would have the same rights and obligations with respect to weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, biological, chemical). It argued for an equitable New International Economic Order (NIEO). Most importantly, itused non-alignment to help carve out an area of Peace outside the bloc Politics of the two superpowers. India joined 160 countries that have signed and ratified the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which provides a roadmap for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases to check global warming. Indian troops have been sent abroad on UN peacekeeping missions in support of cooperative security initiatives.  4. At times, India has been facing epidemic and poverty. Many farmers in Odisha have committed suicide in the last few years. Recently West Bengal faced bird flu crises."
The concept of cooperative security is more effective in dealing with various contemporary threats to security. Justify the statement with any four suitable points. ,"(i) It is widely believed that Cooperation rather than military confrontation is required in order to deal with various contemporary threats to security. (ii) Cooperation can be bilateral, regional, continental or global. It would depend upon the nature of the threat and the willingness and ability of the countries to perform. (iii) Cooperative security may also involve the variety of other players, both international and national-international organizations, non-governmental organizations etc. (iv) Co-operative security may require the use of force as a last resort. The international community may have to sanction the use of force as a last resort.  "
