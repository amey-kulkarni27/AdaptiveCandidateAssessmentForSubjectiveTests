What is ‘Balance of Power’? How could a state achieve this? ,"‘Balance of Power’ is a component of traditional security policy—It is a widely accepted fact that countries of world never had same geography, population, financial resources, military, etc. So, balance of power is integral in states. When small countries look around them, they see that some countries are bigger and stronger. This is a clue to who might be a threat in the future. For instance, a neighbouring country may not say it is preparing for attack. There may be no obvious reason for attack. But the fact that this country is very powerful is a sign that some point in the future, it may choose to be aggressive. Governments are, therefore, very sensitive to the balance of power between their country and other countries. They do work hard to maintain a favourable balance of power with other countries, especially those close by, those with whom they have differences, or with those they have had conflicts in the past. A good part of maintaining a balance of power is to build up one’s military power, although economic and technological power are also important as they are the bases for military power."
"What are the objectives of military alliances? Give an example of a functioning military, alliance with its specific objectives. ","An alliance is a coalition of states that coordinate their actions to deter or defend against military attack. Most alliances are formalised in written treaties and are based on a fairly clear identification of who constitutes the threat. Countries form alliances to increase the effective power relative to another country or alliance. NATO is a powerful organisation, which is still into existence. It aims at maintaining military security of American and West European countries that came under the leadership of USA. It also aims at maintaining military, cultural and economic dominance on western countries."
What are the four elements of security? Give an example of each. ,"There are the four elements of security: 1. Deterrence: The condition where war is tried to be prevented, like nuclear power acted as a deterrent between both the super powers during the Cold War. 2. Military Power: To raise military power to limit or prevent the war and to face external power.  3. Balance of power: Every country works hard to maintain a favourable balance of power, especially in military. For example, purchasing weapons from foreign countries for modernisation of military by India and Pakistan. 4. To form alliances: Some countries form an alliance to increase their military power and coordinate their actions to deter or defend against military attack done on any of the country. For example, ‘NATO’ and ‘Warsaw Pact’ were established by America and USSR respectively."
Explain the process of confidence building under traditional security conception.,"Traditional security also accepts confidence building as a means of avoiding violence. Confidence building is a process in which countries share their thoughts and information with their rivals. They tell each other about their military intentions and, up to a point, their military plans. This is a way to show that they are not planning a surprise attack. They also tell each other about the kind of forces they possess, and they may share information on where those forces are deployed. In short, confidence building is a process designed to ensure that rivals do not go to war through misunderstanding or misperception."
Explain the importance of cooperation in the field of ‘Traditional Security.’ [CBSE (AI) 2015],"The importance of cooperation in the field of ‘Traditional Security’ is disarmament, arms control, and confidence building. Disarmament requires all states to give up certain kinds of weapons. For example, the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and 1992 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) banned the production and possession of these weapons. Arms control regulates the acquisition or development of weapons. The AntiBallistic Missile (ABM) Treaty 1972 tried to stop the United States and the Soviet Union from using ballistic missiles as a defensive shield to launch a nuclear attack. Confidence Building is accepted as a means of avoiding violence. It is a process in which countries share ideas and information with their rivals."
What is disarmament?,"Disarmament literally means ‘not keeping arms’. But no country can safeguard its boundaries without its military capability. So, disarmament refers to limit traditional weapons within a boundary by preventing nuclear weapons. The competition of weapons among countries have caused a global threat to international peace. The need of the hour is to end this competition and establish international peace."
What are the reasons behind increase in terrorism at international level?  ,"Following are the reasons behind increasing terrorism on international level: 1. Information and Technology have paved way for terrorism in its way of execution. That is why, terrorism is a global problem all over the world. 2. Globalisation of economy is responsible behind the situations like theft, hijacking plains or planting of bombs, etc. The exchange of currency of any country has become easier for terrorists. 3. There is a competition of selling modernised weapons. The mastermind, government and traders are equally responsible behind spreading terror at individual level. 4. Advanced transport systems and mediums have enhanced terrorism."
Identify and elaborate any four sources of security threats. ,"Following are the new sources of security threats: 1. Terrorism: It refers to political violence that targets civilians deliberately and indiscriminately. International terrorism involves the citizens or territory of more than one country. Terrorist groups seek to change a political context or condition that they do not like by force or threat of force. Civilian targets are usually chosen to terrorise the public and to use the unhappiness of the public as a weapon against national governments or other parties in conflict. 2. Global Poverty: Global Poverty is another source of insecurity. World population now at 650 crore will reach 700 to 800 within 25 years and may eventually level out of 900 to 1000 crore. Currently, half the world’s population growth occurs in just six countries—India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Among the World’s poorest countries, population is expected to triple in the next 50 years, whereas many rich countries will see population’s shrinkage in that period. High growth rate, high per capita income, high Education level and low population growth will make rich states or rich social groups get richer where as low growth rate, low per capita income, low education level and huge population growth reinforce each other to make poor states and poor groups become poorer. 3. Migration: Poverty in the South has also led to large-scale migration to seek a better life, especially better economic opportunities in the North. This has created international political frictions. International law and norms make a distinction between migrants and refugees. States are generally supposed to accept refugees,but they do not have to accept migrants. While refugees leave their country of origin, people who have fled their homes but remain within national borders are called internally displaced people. 4. Health Epidemics: Health Epidemics such as HIV-AIDS, bird flu, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have rapidly spread across countries through migration,  business, tourism and military operations. One country’s success or failure in limiting the spread of these diseases affects infections in other countries. By 2003, an estimated 4 crore people were infected with HIV-AIDS worldwide, twothirds of them in Africa and half of the rest in South Asia."
How many types of human rights are there?,"Human rights is an issue of human security. Human rights have come to be classified into three types: 1. Political Right seen as voting right, right to contest election and freedom of speech and assembly. 2. Economic and social rights such as right to earn, right to work, right of social security, etc. 3. Right to colonised people or ethnic and indigenous minorities. More emphasis have been given to these rights but there is no agreement on which set of rights should be considered as universal human rights, nor what the international community should do when rights are being violated. Since the 1990s, developments such as Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, the genocide in Rwanda, and the Indonesian military’s killing of people in East Timor have led to a debate on whether or not the UN should intervene to stop human rights abuses. There are those who argue that the UN charter empowers the international community totake up arms in defence of human rights. Others argue that the national interests of the powerful states will determine which instance of human right violations the UN should act upon."
List any four policy directive principles of state mentioned in Indian constitution to promote and international peace and security. ,"Measures of environmental protection, security to wild animals and increase in international peace and security have been mentioned in Article 51 of Indian constitution. On the basis of which India would regulate its foreign policy. Following are the principles: 1. To increase international peace and security. 2. To maintain justified and respectful relations between nations. 3. Foster respect for international law and treaty obligations in the dealings of organised peoples with one another. 4. To make efforts to mediate international controversies and promote settlement of international disputes by arbitration."
Explain the concept of ‘Human Security.’ [CBSE (AI) 2015] ,"Human Security means the protection of the people more than the protection of states. The proponents of human security argue that the primary aim of the state is the protection of its individuals. According to them the concept of human security should include hunger, diseases and natural disasters as they kill even more people than war.Thus, human security should protect people from these threats as well as from violence and war. In its broadest formulation, the human security agenda also encompasses economic security and ‘threats to human dignity’."
"Explain four components of India’s security strategy. [CBSE Delhi, (AI) 2014]","India’s security strategy has four broad components, which have been used in a varying combinations from time to time. 1. Strengthening Military Capabilities: India has been involved in conflicts with its neighbour—Pakistan in 1947-48, 1965, 1971 and 1999; and China in 1962. Since it is surrounded by nuclear-armed countries in the South Asian Region, India’s decision to conduct nuclear test in 1998 was justified by the Indian government in terms of safeguarding national security. India first tested a nuclear device in 1974. 2. Strengthen International Norms: India’s security strategy has been to strengthen international norms and international institutions to protect its security interests. India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru supported the cause of Asian solidarity, decolonisation, disarmament and the UN as a forum in which international conflicts could be settled. Most importantly it used non-alignment to help carve out an area of peace outside the bloc politics of the two superpowers. India joined 160 countries that have signed and ratified the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which provides a road map for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases to check global warming. Indian troops have been sent abroad on UN peacekeeping missions in support of cooperative security initiatives. 3. Internal Security: The third component of Indian security strategy is geared towards meeting security challenges within the country. Several militant groups from areas such as Nagaland, Mizoram, Punjab and Kashmir among others have, from time to time sought to break away from India. India has tried to preserve national unity by adopting a democratic political system, which allows different communities and groups of people to freely articulate their grievances and share political power. 4. Economic Growth: There has been an attempt in India to develop its economy in a way that the vast mass of citizens are lifted out of poverty and misery and huge economic inequalities are not allowed to exist. The attempt has not quite succeeded; we are still a very poor and unequal country. Yet democratic politics allows spaces for articulating the voice of the poor and the deprived citizens. There is a pressure on the democratically elected governments to combine economic growth with human  development. Thus democracy is not just a political ideal; a democratic government is also a way to provide greater security."
"How are the threats faced by the people in the Third World different from those faced by the people living in the First World? Support your answer with examples. [NCERT, CBSE (AI) 2015]","The differences in the threats that people in the Third World faced and those living in the First World. (i) The Third world countries face the threats not only from outside their borders, but also from within. On the other hand, most of the First World countries face threats only from outside their borders. (ii) Third World faces threats from separatist movements. There is no such threat in the First World Countries. Many newly independent countries came to fear their neighbours even more than they feared the US or Soviet Union or formal colonial powers. They quarrelled over borders and territories or control of people and population. (iii) A neighbour might help or investigate an internal separatist movement leading to tensions between the two neighbouring countries. For the new states, external wars with neighbours and internal wars pose a serious challenge to their security.  "
