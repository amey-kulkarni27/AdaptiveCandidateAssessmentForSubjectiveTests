Three factors responsible for the US hegemony in world Politics: (i) The U.S. Hegemony as a Hard Power • •  • •  The most important factor for the overwhelming superiority of US power is its superiority of its military power. American military dominance is both absolute and relative. In absolute terms, the US has military capabilities that can reach any point on the planet accurately, lethally and in real time. While its own forces are sheltered to the maximum extent possible from the dangers of war. No other power can remotely match US military might.

The military dominance of the US is not just based on higher military spending, but on the qualitative gap, that no other power can match.

2,"Q.3. How did a terrorist attack happen on 11 September, 2001 in USA? What was America’s reaction towards it?  Describe 9/11 terrorist attack and America’s reaction towards it.","Ans. 9/11 came to be known as the most unfortunate and ‘Black day’ in the history of US. On 11 September 2001, nineteen hijackers hailing from a number of Arab countries took control of four American Commercial aircrafts shortly after their takeoff and flew them into important buildings in the US. One airline each crashed into North and South Towers of the World Trade Centre in New York. A third aircraft crashed into the Pentagon building in Arlington, where the US Defence Department is headquartered. In America the convention is to write the month first, followed by the date; hence the short form 9/11.America’s reaction: The US response to 9/11 was swift and ferocious. ‘AlQaeda’, terrorist coup was responsible behind this attack. Afghanistan was the part of Al-Qaeda and its supporters also ruled there. George W. Bush was the American President in place of Bill Clinton. He launched ‘Operation Enduring Freedom’ in the US interests. It was all those suspected to be behind this attack, mainly Al-Qaeda and Afghanistan. Taliban’s ruler Mulla Umar was easily overthrown. Afghanistan is being ruled under the Americans’ leadership of Hamid Karzai. But remnants of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda have remained patent, as is clear from the number of terrorist attacks launched by them against Western targets. The US forces made arrests all over the world, often without the knowledge of the government of the persons being arrested, transported these persons across countries and detained them in secret prisons. Some of them were brought to Guantanomo Bay, a US naval base in Cuba, where the prisoners did not enjoy the protection of international law or the law of their own country  or that of the US. Even the UN representatives were not allowed to meet those prisoners."
3,Q.4. Write an essay on Indo-US relations.,"Ans. US administration was sympathetic towards India during the struggle of independence but after independence, when India adopted the policy of non-alignment, bitterness among their relations was seen. The gap widened due to India’s relationship with USSR. After the collapse of USSR, when India could see the whole world was almost under the US hegemony, India changed its foreign policy. America provided military and economic assistance to India during the time of China attack in 1962 and thus, their relationship became cordial. During independence of Bangladesh in 1971, bitterness again emerged among their relationship. But in 1978, India’s visit of American President and America’s visit of Indian President made their relationship cordial. The organisation of India’s festival in America also improved the relationship between both in 1985. US put military and economic restrictions on India after nuclear test was done by India in May 1998. The pressure for signing CTBT on India further widened the gap. The restrictions were taken back by US during Kargil War in May 1999. This improved relationship and after 2000, the relations became cordial in the period of Bill Clinton and Atal Bihari Vajpayi. Both of them had their own interests behind such changes. Due to America’s own trade interests, technology market and continuous emerging power of China, America could not ignore a big country with nuclear power like India. There was a drastic change in the outlook of US after the terrorist attack of 11 September, 2001 on US. It considered India as a real friend for eliminating terrorism. The trade relations between both the countries are deepened. In recent times, America removed import duty from 42 types of goods, which are imported from India which amounts more than approximate 60 crore dollars. American President George W. Bush and Indian Prime Minister Vajpayi made a consent on energy, environment, health, space (weather and communication), export control, science and technology with existence in biotechnology & information technology also to wide the scope of communication. US also helped India in taking loan from World Bank of one arab dollar."
4,Q.5. Write about US hegemony in terms of US Military power. [CBSE (AI) 2013] Or Write about US hegemony as a superpower. [CBSE (AI) 2014],"Ans. The term ‘hegemony’ implies the leadership on predominance of one state. The first meaning of hegemony relates to the relations, patterns and balances of military capability between states. The bedrock of contemporary US power lies in the overwhelming superiority of its military power. American military dominance today is both absolute and relative. It can reach any country or state or region, thereby crippling  the adversary while its forces are sheltered to the maximum extent possible from the dangers of war. The absolute capabilities of the US is the fact that no other power today can remotely match them. The US today spends more on its military capability than the next 12 powers combined. Although, the US invasion of Iraq reveals several American vulnerabilities. The US has not been able to force the Iraqi people into submitting to the occupation forces of the US-led coalition. Imperial powers through history have used military forces to accomplish four tasks: to conquer, deter, punish and police. US has been able to succeed in first three tasks. It has won Iraq and has restricted Iraqi powers. Punishment of death to President Hussain and his supporters was given but US military capability has thus far been shown to have serious weaknesses in policing an occupied territory."
5,Q.6. Describe US hegemony as a structural power.,"Ans. In the world politics, economic power also plays an important role with hard power. It raises political dominance of the country as well. This is known as structural power. The basic idea is that an open world economy requires a hegemony or dominant power to support its creation and existence. The hegemony must possess both the ability and the desire to establish certain norms for order and must sustain the global structure. The hegemony usually does this to its own advantage but often its relative detriment, as its competitors take advantage of the openness of the world economy without paying the costs of maintaining its openness. Hegemony is reflected in the role played by the US in providing global public goods. Public goods are those goods that can be consumed by one person without reducing the goods available for someone else. Fresh air and roads are examples of public goods. In the context of world economies, the best examples of a global public goods are sea-lines of communication, (SLOCs), the sea routes were commonly used by merchant ships. Free trade in an open world economy would not be possible without open SLOCs. Naval power of hegemony underwrites the law of the sea and ensures freedom of navigation in international waters. Since the decline of British naval power after the Second World War, the multi-oceanic US navy has played this role. Another example of a global public good is the Internet. It is the direct outcome of a US military research project, making the virtual world of the World Wide Web possible. US is present in all the sectors of the World economy and in all areas of technology. The US share of the world economy is 28 per cent. The US also accounts for 15 percent of World trade. The Bretton woods system, set up by the US after the Second World War still constitute the basic structure of the world economy. We can regard the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Trade Organisation (WTO) as the products of American hegemony. A classic example of the structural power of the US is the academic degree called Masters in Business Administration (MBA). The idea that business is a profession that depends upon skills that can be taught in a university is uniquely American. The first business school in the world, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, was established in 1881. The first MBA courses were initiated around 1900. The first MBA course outside the US  was established only in 1950. There is no country in the world today in which the MBA is not a prestigious academic degree."
