What were the challenges faced by Sri Lanka after independence?,"Sri Lanka had to face challenge from ethnic conflict after independence. Sri Lanka was dominated by the forces that represented the interest of the majority of Sinhala community. They were hostile to a large number of Tamils who had migrated from India to Sri Lanka and settled there. This migration continued even after the independence.They were only 19 per cent of the total population. The Sinhala nationalists thought that Sri Lanka should not give ‘concessions’ to the Tamils. The neglect of Tamil concerns led to militant Tamil nationalism for interests of culture, language and identity."
How are the external powers influencing bilateral relations in South Asia? ,"South Asia has been under the influence of external powers due to its natural formation. India adopted the policy of non-alignment during the cold war but Pakistan became a member of NATO, thus affecting India-Pakistan relations and leading to conflicts and tensions. Pakistan supported terrorist activities in India with the assistance given by America. China and USA play an important role in politics of South Asia. IndiaChina relations became bitter on issues of Tibet crises and McMohan line. Chinese support to Pakistan was one of the reasons for bitterness in their relations. In recent years, India-China economic relations have improved. American coherence has been increased in this region from the end of Cold War. America has tried to maintain cordial relationship with India and Pakistan. Economic development, globalisation and  liberalisation have increased the role of America in this region. America thinks that safety and peace is essential in the region as there is a hugepopulation and huge market in South Asia."
Why were superpowers more interested in South Asian countries during the Cold War era? How did this affect the region?,"South Asia is the region where lots of internal affairs and global struggles exist. American involvement in South Asia rapidly increased after the cold war because this region could provide ports against its enemies - Soviet Union and China. America looked towards India but since India became a member of non-aligned movement, it headed towards Pakistan. A series of issues arose in this region. Issues like boundary affairs and distribution of river waters have made this region unrest. The fact that the region can develop if the countries cooperate with each other was observed by citizens of these countries."
Why did India interfere in the affair of East Pakistan?,"After independence, people of East Pakistan resented the domination of Western Pakistan and the imposition of the Urdu language. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led the popular struggle against West Pakistani domination. They demanded autonomy for the eastern region. In 1970, national assembly elections were held in Pakistan. The Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur won all the seats in East Pakistan and secured a majority (313 out of 167) is proposed constituent assembly for the whole of Pakistan. But the government dominated by the West Pakistani leadership refused to convene the assembly. Sheikh Mujibur was arrested. Under the military rule of General YahyaKhan, the Pakistan army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. Thousands were killed by the Pakistani army. This led to a large scale migration into India, creating a huge refugee problem for India. The government of India supported the demand of the people of East Pakistan for independence and helped them financially and militarily. This resulted in a war between India and Pakistan in December 1971 that ended in the surrender of the Pakistani forces in East Pakistan and the formation of ‘Bangladesh’ as an independent country."
Why did India had to call back its army from Sri Lanka?,"There was a considerable pressure from Tamil people in India to effect that the Indian government should protect the interests of the Tamils in Sri Lanka. On 29 July, 1987, India signed an accord with Sri Lanka in which provincial councils in northern and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka were formed and provincial autonomy to them was given. The aim of the agreement was to save interests of Tamil and their identity by maintaining sovereignty of Sri Lanka. It was also decided that ‘Tamil Tigers’ would end the struggle and give up their weapons. But the agreement could not be implemented completely. Sri Lanka said India to sent military troops in order to establish peace in north-eastern states of country. Indian military troops tried to establish peace in Sri Lanka with the help of Sri Lankan government. Eventually, the Indian army got into a  fight with LTTE. Shri Premdas became Presidentof Sri Lanka. He was completely against the presence of Indian army in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan citizens saw this as an India’s attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka. Indian Tamils were also unhappy with the proceedings being done against them (Sri Lankan Tamilians) by India. Sri Lankan President Premdasa openly demanded India to take back its armed forces on 29 July, 1989. Uncertainty and strain continued for some time in Sri Lanka. But in December 1989, after the formation of new government, Indian Peace Keeping Force was called back from Sri Lanka on 31 March, 1990."
What steps have been taken to normalise Indo-Pak relations by Indian rulers in last two decades?,"Pakistan’s support to terrorism in Kashmir still continues. Despite of this, Prime Minister Gujral tried to improve bilateral relations. Prime Minister Vajpayee did Lahore Bus Tour and signed Lahore announcement letter in order to promote harmony. In return to this, kargil war was held between both the countries as an undisclosed war. Agra-talks of 2001 failed and terrorist attack on Parliament in December 2001 inspired India to end all diplomatic relations with Pakistan. Pakistan’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) is alleged to be involved in managing in Anti-Indian campaigns. Diplomatic initiatives were again started in 2003 but this was a pain staking way and both the countries were heading for friendly solution carefully. This pause was broken down by Vajpayee’s visit to Islamabad and to start cricket between both countries again. A Re-evaluation of relationship of both the countries was proposed by Manmohan Singh (former Prime Minister of India). Hindrance was seen during Mumbai bomb blast in 2006 but both countries agreed to continue discussion. SAARC summit held at New Delhi 2007 paved way for peace and friendliness in this area between both the countries. They accepted that terrorisom is a challenge in the way of peace and security. When Pakistani Prime Minister visited India in 2014, people of both the countries hoped for a fresh start and improved relations. But Pakistan’s irresponsible attitude towards terrorism cannot be trusted upon. It agrees on eliminating terrorism but does not take any initiative. Instead, it promotes terrorism."

Why was the need of establishment of SAARC felt?,"Almost all superpowers tried to influence this region due to which these countries could not become united for mutual cooperation. Countries were seen under the influence of either America or Soviet Union. Tensions were seen among the countries of this region. These superpowers accelerated navy activities and established navy ports in the Indian ocean which led to fear of regional unstability among countries of the region. It was observed that if unity and cooperation among the countries of this region didn’t get establish, then these countries would be exploited by outside powers. It was also felt that mutual cooperation and help can pave the way of their development and can present a powerful region in front of the world. India considers the need of regional cooperation for international peace and order. An organisation of neighbouring countries of India was made in December 1985 for regional cooperation. It is known as ‘The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation’ (SAARC). Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are involved in SAARC. Its head office is in Kathmandu (Nepal)."
How did citizens of Nepal succeed in establishing democracy?,"Nepal was a Hindu kingdom in the past and then a constitutional monarchy. Political parties and the common people of Nepal have wanted a more open and responsive system of government. But the king, with the help of the army, retained full control over the government and restricted the expansion of democracy in Nepal. Seigniorial system was there in Nepal till 1950. Rana-family made Nepal king a puppet of their hands. Nepal’s then king Tribhuvan, took shelter in Indian embassy situated at Kathmandu in 1950. In this way, seigniorial system in Nepal came to an end with the help of India and powers came in the hands of king of Nepal, paving way for democracy. From 1950 to 1990, constitutional monarchy was established in the Hindu region of Nepal. The topmost rights were given to the king in the government of Maharaja Tribhuvan, Mahendra, Virendra and Gyanendra. Democratic governments had also been setup several times in those 40 years. Either there was a parliamentary democraticsystem or Panchayat Democracy. But the king was given the topmost rights and powers. During the nineties, the Maoists of Nepal were successful in spreading their influence in many parts of Nepal. They believed in armed insurrection against the  monarch and the ruling elite. This led to a violent conflict between the Maoist guerrillas and the armed forces of the king. For some time, there was a triangular conflict among the Monarchist forces, the democrats and the Maoists. In 2002, the king abolished the parliament and dismissed the government. King of Nepal, Virendra was assasinated and Gyanendra, brother of Virendra became king of Nepal. He also adopted the policy of suppression of democracy and Maoists. This led to a massive, country wide, prodemocracy protests in April 2002. As a result, the king was forced to restore the House of Representatives that had been dissolved inApril 2002. The largely non-violent movement was led by the Seven Party Alliance (SPA), the Maoists and the social activists. Monarchy has sacrificed all its rights. Nepal is considered as a secural country. A constitutional assembly has been formed for new constitution of Nepal. Nepal is a democratic country now. India has got Nepal as a democratic partner with increase in aspirations."
Countries of South Asia do not trust each other. This region is unable to exert its influence at international level. Justify this statement and suggest measures to strengthen South Asia.,"The statement is totally justified that SAARC is an association of countries of South Asia but is not able to carry out work as an effective organisation due to mutual differences between these countries. They do not trust each other, especially suspicious towards India. Following are the two examples to justify the statement: 1. India-Pakistan are powerful countries of SAARC. Both countries are involved in various conflicts and differences after division and hence, they do not trust each other. Pakistan has held hand of America against India. Two wars have been done between both the countries. The Indian government blamed Pakistan for terrorism and Pakistan government hold India responsible for increasing unstability and unrest. America and China get chance to interfere due to these differences and struggle. 2. There are tensions between India and Sri Lanka. The settlement of Indian Tamils in Sri Lanka is the main reason behind the tensions. India sent the Indian peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka to resolve matter but was pulled out as it was critised by Sri Lankans. The affair/issue has not been resolved yet.Following are the ways to strengthen South Asia: • • • • • •  To unite countries of South Asia by sinking all differences. To peacefully resolve mutual problems instead of using armed forces. To form an environment of mutual cooperation to eliminate terrorism. To use powers of nuclear countries (India and Pakistan) for peaceful areas. Not to take help of external powers to resolve mutual problems. To take initiative to make South Asia economically strong. "
India’s neighbours often think that the Indian government tries to dominate and interfere in the domestic affairs of the smaller countries of the region. Is this a correct impression? ,"Various factors are responsible for the thinking of smaller countries of South Asia towards India; which are as follows: 1. Given size and powers of India, smaller countries are bound to be suspicious of India’s intentions. 2. Interference of India in internal affairs of Pakistan and helping in transformation of East Pakistan to Bangladesh, a newly independent country is another reason of this thinking of smaller countries. 3. Needs of smaller countries are met by India to prevent entry of external powers in India. This make smaller countries doubt on India. 4. They think that India wants to ‘invade’ and dominate international markets with the help of SAFTA. The thinking of smaller countries towards India is not a correct impression. It can be cleared by the following facts: 1. India believes in truth, peace and principle of non-violence. It believes in the principle of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ (the world is one family), in which not only one country but the whole world is seen as a family. 2. India is always ready to help all other countries, be it natural calamity or any other disaster. India assisted Bangladesh during floods. Help was given by India to Sri Lanka after Tsunami. Military help was provided to the Maldives during military attack on the Maldives. 3. India has always provided shelter to refugees those came from different countries. 4. India has given an open invitation to SAARC countries to sell their products without any trade tariffs."
