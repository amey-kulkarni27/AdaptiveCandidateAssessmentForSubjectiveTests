Ans. Decrease.
Q.10.What are chromatophores?
Ans. Chromatophores are pigment containing and light-reflecting cells or group of cells found
in bacteria and wide range of animals.
Q.11.Name the two classes of pigments in bacteria.
Ans. The two classes of pigments in bacteria are:

Q. 14. How many molecules of ATP and how many molecules of NADPH + 𝐇+ are spent
to fix three molecules of C𝐎𝟐 ?
[KVS Agra 2016]
Ans. Fixation of three molecules of CO2 uses 9 ATP and 6 NADPH molecules in C3 plants.In
C4 plants for fixation of 3 CO2 molecules 15 ATP and 6 NADPH and 6 NADPH energy is
equired.
Q. 15. What is the site of formation of glycoxylate from glycolate?
Ans. The site of formation of glyoxylate from glycolate is peroxisomes of mesophyll cells.
Q. 16. Why are the 𝐂𝟒 plants more efficient in picking up C𝐎𝟐 when it is found in low
concentration.
Ans. The C4 plants are more efficient in picking up CO4 even when it is found in low
concentration because of the high affinity of PEP.
Q. 17. Give two examples of 𝐂𝟒 plants.
Ans. (i) 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑖𝑏𝑜𝑟𝑏𝑖𝑎, (ii)𝐵𝑜𝑢𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑎.
Q. 18. What is assimilatory power ?
Ans. Chemical energy of ATP and reducing power of NADP H2 , are assimilatory powers.
Q. 19. In what form carbohydrates are translocated in plants ?
Ans. Carbohydrates are translocated in plants in the form of sucrose.
Q. 20. What is photon ? What is the term given to the energy contained in photon ?
Ans. Discrete partidles believed to be present in light are called photons. The energy
contained in a photon is termed as quantum.
Q. 21. Why are the C, plants more affected by high temperatures ?
Ans. At high temperature 𝐂𝟑 plants are more affected because of increased affinity of
RuBisCo to oxygen.
Q. 22. Name three cell organelles involved photorespiration.
Ans. Chloroplast, Mitochondria and Peroxisomes.
Q. 23. Name the C𝐎𝟐 acceptor in 𝐂𝟒 cycle.
Ans. PEP (Phosphoenol Pyruvic acid).
Q.24. What are quantasomes ?

Ans. It is a distinct morphological structural unit in the thylakoid which embodies a
photosynthetic unit.
Q. 25. A potted plant otherwise kept in sunlight,ih shifted to monochromatic red light
Will the rate of photosynthesis increase, decrease or remain the same ?
Ans. Decrease.
Q. 26. Where is NADP reductase enzyme located ?
Ans. NADP reductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the membrane.
Q. 27. How does the light beyond the saturation point affect photosynthesis?
Ans. Beyond the saturation point, an increase in incident light causes the breakdown of
chlorophyll and a decreased process of photosynthesis.
Q. 28. What is Kranz anatomy ?
Ans. Kranz anatomy is the special structure of leaves in C4 PLANTS (eg. maize) where the
tissue equivalent to the spongy mesophyll cells is clustered in a ring around the leaf veins,
outside the bundle-sheath cells.
Q. 29. Which compound acts as C 𝐎𝟐 acceptor in Calvin cycle ?
Ans. Ribulose-1-5-biphosphate, a 5-carbon compound is the acceptor of C O2 in Calvin cycle.
Q. 30. Name the primary acceptor of carbon dioxide in 𝐂𝟑 and 𝐂𝟒 plants.
Ans. C3 plants : 5 Carbon Ketose Sugar, Ribulose-1,5- bisphosphate (RuBP) C4 plants: 3Carbon molecule phosphoend pyruvate (PEP).
Q. 31. Name the hormones which increase and decrease the rate of photosynthesis.
Ans. Cytokinins and gibberellins increase and ABA decrease the rate of photosynthesis.
Q. 32. Why are transitional curves produced during low of limiting factor?
Ans. The transitional curves are produced because of the presence of a large number of
green cells and numerous chloroplast in the cell.
Q. 33. Define light compensation point ?
Ans. The point in light intensity where no gaseous exchange occur during photosynthesis is
called as light compensation point.
Q. 34. What is C𝐎𝟐 compensation point ?
Ans. When CO2 conc. is reduced, there comes a point at which illuminated plant stop
absorbing CO2 from the environment, it is known as C O2 compensation point.
Q. 35. Name the first C𝐎𝟐 fixation produced in 𝐂𝟒 plants.
Ans. Oxaloacetic acid (OAA)

Q. 36. What is Warburg effect?
Ans. At very high oxygen content, the rate of photosynthesis begins to decline in all plants,
this phenomenon is called Warburg effect.
Q. 37. What is red drop ?

[Imp.]

Ans. Red drop is the occasional fall in photosynthetic yield beyond red region of spectrum
(Emersor 1943). This is also called Emerson effect.
Q. 38. What are antennae in photosystem ?
