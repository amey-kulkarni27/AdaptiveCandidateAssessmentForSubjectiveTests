1,Q. 2. Describe different stages of personality development proposed by Freud.,"Ans. The stages of personality are: i.  ii.  iii.  iv.  Oral Stage: It spans between 0 to 1.5 years of age in which the newborn’s or the infant’s mouth is the pleasure seeking centre. The infant achieves oral gratification through feeding, thumb sucking, biting and babbling. Anal Stage: It spans between 1.5 to 3 years of age in which the anal area gives pleasurable feelings. The child experiences pleasure by retention or expulsion of bowels. Phallic Stage: This stage spans between 3 to 6 years of age and the pleasure seeking area are the genitals. The children begin to realize the relationship between males and females and become aware of the relationship between their parents. The male child experiences the Oedipus complex which involves love for the mother, hostility towards the father and the consequent fear of punishment or castration by the father (Oedipus was a Greek king who unknowingly killed his father and then married his mother). The girls at this stage develop Electra complex in which the girls shows love for their father and symbolically marry him and raise a family (Electra was a Greek character who induced her brother to kill their mother). By the end of this stage, the Oedipus complex and the Electra complex are resolved in which boys give up sexual feelings for their mothers and begin to see their fathers as role models rather than as rivals while the girls give up their sexual desires for their father and identify with their mother. Latency Stage: This stage spans between 6 to 12 years of age. During this period the child continues to grow physically, but sexual urges are relatively  inactive. Much of the child’s energy is channeled into social or achievementrelated activities. Genital Stage: This stage spans between 12 to 18 years of age and the repressed feelings of the earlier stages are once again exhibited. People learn to deal with members of opposite sex in a socially and sexually matured way.  v. "
2,Q. 3. What are defence mechanisms? Explain with examples.,"Ans. According to Freud, defence mechanisms are ways in which the ego unconsciously tries to cope with unacceptable Id desires or impulses. Human behaviour reflects an attempt to deal with or escape from anxiety. Freud described various defence mechanisms which people use to reduce anxiety by distorting reality. Defence mechanisms reduce anxiety temporarily. The optimum use of defence mechanisms is useful, normal and adaptive but excessive use is harmful which can even lead to distortion of reality and develop various forms of maladjustment and psychological problems. The various defence mechanisms are: i.  ii.  • •  iii. iv.  v.  vi.  Repression: In this anxiety-provoking behaviours or thoughts are totally dismissed by the unconscious. For example, when people repress a feeling or desire, they become totally unaware of that wish or desire. Projection: In this people attribute their own traits to others. For e.g. a person who has strong aggressive tendencies may see other people as acting in an excessively aggressive way towards him or her. By means of projection an individual. blames others for his own shortcomings, mistakes, anxiety, guilt, misdeeds. blames others for his own unacceptable impulses, thoughts and desires For example, a student failing in an examination blames the teacher for being unfair or the fate being bad (bad luck). Denial: In this a person totally refuses to accept reality. For example, someone suffering from HIV/AIDS may altogether deny his or her illness. Reaction Formation: In this a person defends against anxiety by adopting behaviours opposite to his or her true feelings. For example, a person with strong sexual urges channels his or her energy into religious fervour. Rationalisation: In this a person tries to make unreasonable feelings or behaviour seem reasonable and acceptable. For example, a person eats the chocolate giving the reason that it will melt in the sun in his pocket. Displacement: A frustrated person may show aggressive behaviour towards a weaker person. For example, members of a majority group in a society may be prejudiced against members of a minority group, and may show aggressive behaviour towards a minority group member, such as using abusive language or physically assaulting the minority group member.

3,Q. 4. What do projective techniques bring from the unconscious mind? Explain briefly the projective techniques with examples.,"Ans. Projective techniques were developed to assess unconscious motives and feelings. These techniques are based on the assumption that a less structured or unstructured stimulus or situation will allow the individual to project his/her feelings, desires and needs on to that situation. i.  ii.  iii.  iv.  a. b. c. v.  a. b. c.  Rorschach Inkblot test: This test consists of 10 inkblots, 5 of them are in black and white, 2 in red ink and the remaining 3 in pastel colours. The blots were prepared by dropping ink on a piece of paper and folding the paper in half. The subjects are shown the cards and are asked to tell what they see in each of the cards and where, how and what basis was a particular response made. Thematic Apperception Test (TAT): This test consists of black and white picture cards and a blank card. Each picture card depicts one or more people in a variety of situations. The cards are presented one at a time. The subject is asked to tell a story describing the situation presented in the picture: what led up to the situation, what is happening at the moment, what will happen in the future and what the characters are feeling and thinking. Rosenzweig’s Picture-Frustration Study (P-F Study): This test presents with the help of cartoon like pictures in which one person frustrates another or calls attention to a frustrating condition. Observation is made whether the subject protects the frustrated person or finds a constructive solution to the problem. The direction of aggression may be towards the environment, towards oneself or may be to avoid the situation. Sentence Completion Test: This test makes use of a number of incomplete sentences. The starting part of the sentence is first presented and the subject has to provide an ending to the sentence. These endings reflect the subject’s attitudes, motivation and conflicts. Examples of sentence completion tests are: My father ____________. My greatest fear is _____________. I am proud of _______________. Draw-a-Person Test: In this test the subject has to draw a person on a sheet of paper and then the figure of an opposite sex. Then the subject is asked to make a story about the person as if s/he was a character in a novel or play. Some examples of interpretations are: Omission of facial features suggests that the person tries to evade a highly conflict-ridden interpersonal relationship. Graphic emphasis on the neck suggests lack of control over impulses. Disproportionately large head suggests organic brain disease and pre-occupation with headaches. "
4,"Q. 5. What do you understand by personality? Explain assessment of personality using behavioural analysis. [CBSE Delhi 2011; (AI) 2011, 2015]","Ans. Personality refers to our characteristic ways of responding to individuals and situations. For example, a person who is socially active, assertive, talkative and funloving is an extravert personality. The methods for personality assessment using behavioural analysis are: Interview: This involves seeking information from a person on a one-to-one basis. This can be structured or unstructured. For example, an employer selecting employees for his/her organization. Behaviour ratings are used for assessment of personality in educational and industrial settings. In this, individuals are put into certain categories in terms of their behavioural qualities. These ratings have drawbacks such as halo effect, middle category bias and extreme response bias. This method is used in obtaining peer assessment. In this each person is asked to choose one or more persons of the group with whom s/he would like to work, study, play or participate in an activity. The person may be asked to specify the reason for his or her choices. The most commonly used test of this kind is the situational stress test. It involves a kind of role-playing in which a person performs a task with other persons, who are noncooperative and interfering. Thus, this test provides us with information about how a person behaves under stressful situations."
5,Q. 6. Describe the key features of self-report measures used in personality assessment.,"Ans. Key features of self-report measures are: i.  ii.  iii.  In psychology, a self-report is a test, measure, or survey that relies on the individual’s own report of their symptoms, behaviors, beliefs, or attitudes. Selfreport data is gathered from paper-and-pencil or electronic format, or sometimes through an interview. Self-reports are commonly used in psychological studies largely because much valuable and diagnostic information about a person is revealed to a researcher or a clinician based on a person’s report on himself or herself. One of the most commonlyused self-report tools is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) for personality testing. One of the primary advantages of self-report data is that it can be easily obtained. It is one of the instrumental ways that clinicians diagnose their patients—by asking questions. Those making the self-report are usually familiar with filling outquestionnaires. For research, it is an inexpensive tool that can  iv.  v. •  •  reach many more test subjects than could be analyzed by observation or other methods. It can be performed relatively quickly so a researcher can obtain results in days or weeks rather than observing a population over the course of longer time frames. The self-reports can be made in private and can be anonymized to protect sensitive information and perhaps promote truthful responses. Collecting information through a self-report, however, has its limitations As people are often biased when they report on their own experiences. For example, many individuals are either consciously or unconsciously influenced by ‘social desirability,’ that is, they are more likely to report experiences that are considered to be socially acceptable or preferred. This ‘multi-modal’ or ‘multi-method’ assessment provides a more global and therefore likely more accurate picture of the subject.  "
