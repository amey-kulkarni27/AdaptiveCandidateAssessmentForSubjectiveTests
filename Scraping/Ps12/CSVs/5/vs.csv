[CBSE Delhi 2011, 2015, 2016; (AI) 2014]","Psychometric approach to intelligence expresses the individual’s performance in terms of a single index of cognitive abilities. For example, Binet’s Uni or one-factor theory of intelligence. Information processing approach describes the processes people use in intellectual reasoning and problem solving. For example, Howard Gardner’s theory of Multiple Intelligence."

Describe the Two-factor Theory of Intelligence.,"Charles Spearman proposed intelligence as consisting of a general factor called gfactor and some specific factors called s-factors. The g-factor includes mental operations which are primary and common to all performances. S-factors are specific abilities like those possessed by excellent singers, architects, scientists and athletes."

Learning of digits, alphabets, multiplication tables are examples of successive processing."

What is Intelligence Quotient?,"Intelligence Quotient (IQ) refers to mental age, divided by chronological age and multiplied by 100. Mental Age (MA) is the measure of a person’s intellectual development relative to the people of his or her age group. Chronological Age (CA) is the biological age by birth. "
Classify people on the basis of IQ.  How are IQ scores distributed in a population? 2015]  [CBSE (AI) ,Above 130 120–130 110–119 90–109 80–89 70–79 Below 70  Very superior Superior High average Average Low average Borderline Mentally challenged/retarded 
What is normal probability curve?,"Normal probability curve is a bell-shaped curve, symmetrical around the central value, the mean. For example, frequency distribution for IQ scores."
Define mental retardation.,"The children who show enormous difficulty in learning even very simple skills or adapting to the environment show intellectual deficiency are referred to as ‘Mentally Challenged’ or ‘Mentally Retarded’. The American Association on Mental Deficiency defines mental retardation as significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behaviour and manifested during the developmental period, i.e., between 0 to 18 years of age."
