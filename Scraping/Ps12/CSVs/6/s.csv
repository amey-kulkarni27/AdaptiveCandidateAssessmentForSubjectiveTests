Describe Naturalistic and Participant Observation.   ,"Naturalistic Observation is one of the primary ways of learning about the way people behave in a given setting. Suppose, you want to learn how people behave in response to a heavy discount provided by a company while visiting a shopping mall. For this, you could visit the shopping mall where the discounted items are showcased and systematically observe what people do and say before and after the purchases have been made. Participant Observation is a method of naturalistic observation in which the observer is actively involved in the process of observing by becoming an active member of the setting where the observation takes place. For example, an observer may take a part-time job in a shopping mall showroom to become an insider in order to observe variations in the behaviour of customers."
Explain three skills of communication.  [CBSE (AI) 2016] ,"The three skills of communication are: i. ii.  iii. • • • • • •  Speaking: This involves the use of language which the communicator should use appropriately. Active listening: Academic success, employment achievement and personal happiness depend upon your ability to listen effectively. Listening requires a person to be attentive. S/he should be patient, non-judgmental and yet have the capacity to analyze and respond. Body language or non-verbal skills: It is possible to communicate effectively even without using verbal language: The language that people exchange without using words is called body language Use of gesture, posture, eye contact, clothing style, body movement and facial expressions are some examples of body language. All these together form a cluster. These non-verbal acts are symbolic and communication is effective only when we use these. A person’s background and past pattern of behavior are considered important in analyzing body language. Body language can encourage and discourage the conversation. For example, crossing arms over the chest may suggest that a person likes to keep aloof. But, crossed arms accompanied by an erect posture, tightened body muscles, a set clenched jaw and a narrowing of the eyes are likely to communicate anger. "
What are psychological tests and what skills are required by psychologists to use these and where are they used? ,"Psychological tests involve psychological assessment, evaluation and problem solving with individuals and groups, organization, and the community. Psychologists have always been interested in understanding individual differences. Psychological tests have been devised and are primarily used for the determination and analysis of individual differences in general intelligence, differential aptitudes, educational achievement, vocational fitness, personality, social attitudes, and various non- intellectual characteristics. Psychologists study these differences based on factors such as occupation, age, gender, education, culture, etc. While using psychological tests an attitude of objectivity, scientific orientation, and standardized interpretation must be kept in mind. For example, in organizational and personnel work, in business and industry, where specialized tests are used to select individuals for specific jobs, it is essential to use actual performance records or ratings as a criterion for establishing validity of a test."
