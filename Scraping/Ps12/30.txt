Q. 2. What are the characteristics of communication?
Ans. i.

ii.
iii.

iv.

Communication is dynamic because the process is constantly in a state of
change. As the expectations, attitudes, feelings, and emotions of the persons
who are communicating change, the nature of their communication also changes.
Communication is continuous because it never stops, whether we are asleep or
awake we are always processing ideas or thoughts. Our brain remains active.
Communication is irreversible because once we send a message we cannot
take it back. Once we have made a slip of tongue, given a meaningful glance, or
engaged in an emotional outburst, we cannot erase it. Our apologies or denials
can make it light but cannot stamp out what was communicated.
Communication is interactive because we are constantly in contact with other
people and with ourselves. Others react to our speech and actions, and we react
to our own speech and actions, and then react to those reactions. Thus, a cycle
of action and reaction is the basis of communication.

[CBSE (AI)

Ans. It is possible to communicate effectively even without using verbal language:
The language that people exchange without using words is called body language
Use of gesture, posture, eye contact, clothing style, body movement and facial
expressions are some examples of body language. All these together form a cluster.
These non-verbal acts are symbolic and communication is effective only when we use
these.
A person’s background and past pattern of behavior are considered important in
analyzing body language.
Body language can encourage and discourage the conversation
For example, crossing arms over the chest may suggest that a person likes to keep
aloof. But, crossed arms accompanied by an erect posture, tightened body muscles, a
set clenched jaw and a narrowing of the eyes are likely to communicate anger.
