Long Answer Type Question
Q.1. How many types of body symmetry found in animals?
Ans. Body symmetry refers to the similarity with the arrangement of parts on the opposite
sides of body of a three-dimensional animal.
(i)The body of some animals cannot be divided into two equal halves in any plane Such
animals are called asymmetric or asymmetrical e.g., some sponge.
(ii) The body of other animals can be divided into two equal halves in one or more planes.
Such animals are called symmetrical.
(iii) The symmetrical animals may exhibit two types of symmetry-radial symmetry and bilateral
symmetry.
(1) Radial Symmetry: (i) If the body of an animal can be divided into two equal halves by
cutting it in any plane passing through the central axis, it is called radial symmetry. Animals
showing radial symmetry are called radiata. e.g., cnidarians, ctenophorans, echinodermates.
(ii) The body of such animal can be divided into similar left and right halves through one plane
only. Such a symmetry is called bilateral symmetry and such animals are called bilateral.
e.g., from phylum Platyhelminthes to Chordata.
Q.2. How can you group the animals on the basis of their nitrogenous wastes?
Ans. The excretory organs not only removes the nitrogenous wastes but also maintain water
level in the body. On the basis of the nature of the nitrogenous wastes, animals are grouped
into three types-ammonotelic, ureotelic and uricotelic,
(a) Ammonotelic Animals : They excrete nitrogen wastes in the form of ammonia.
Ammonotelic animals lose more water with ammonia from their body. e.g., aquatic animals
such as sponges, coelenterates, crustaceans.
(b) Ureotelic Animals : They excrete nitrogenous wastes in the form of urea. The loss of
water from the body with urea is comparatively less in these animals e.g., cartilaginous fishes,
amphibians and mammals
(c) Uricotelic Animals: They excrete uric acid or its salt, e.g., Birds, Snakes, Lizards etc.
Q.3. Give distinguishing features of Phylum Porifera.
Ans. Phylum Porifera includes the most primitive and simplest animals. They are commonly
called sponges.
(i) They show cellular level of organisation. The cells are almost independent, cooperating
very little with one another in their function.
(ii) The sponges are diploblastic i.e.; the sponges develop from two germs layers called
ectoderm and endoderm.

(iii) The sponges have porous body viz. provided with pores. The pores are of two types:
inhalant pores are called ostia (e.g. ostium) and exhalent pores are known as oscula (e.g.,
osculum).
(iv) The animals possess a large cavity called spongocoel or paragastric cavity. It opens to the
outside by a terminal opening called osculum.
(v) One of the most important features of sponges is the presence of an interconnected
network of channels called canal system. Water enters the spongocoel through ostia and goes
outside through osculum.
(vi) The sponges possess an internal skeleton of calcareous or siliceous + spicule s or
irregular proteinaceous spongin fibers or both located in mesenchyme.
(vii) Asexual reproduction occurs by budding or special cell mass called gemmules or internal
buds. Sexual reproduction involves the formation of ova and spermatozoa.
(Any five)
Q.4. Write a brief note on reproduction of Platyhel â€“ minthes.
Ans. (i) Flatworms are generally hermaphrodite. However, the anatomy of reproduction
system encourages cross fertilization.
(ii) Gonads have ducts which leads to the copulatory organs.
(iii) They are viviparous.
(iv) Life history often includes one or more larva stages
(v) Most of the parasitic forms involve more than one host to complete their life cycle.
(vi) Asexual reproduction by transverse fission occurs in some forms.
(vii) They also have the power of regeneration.
Q.5. Give the salient features of phylum Annelida.
Ans. Salient features of phylum Annelida:
(i) Annelids occur in fresh water, sea water or moist soil. Some are free living, some are
burrowing and a few are parasitic.
(ii) The annelids are characterised by metameric segmentation, viz, the body is divided
externally by ring like grooves, the annuli and internally by transverse septa. The segments
are called metameres.
(iii) They show bilateral symmetry.
(iv) Annelids are triploblastic animals.
(v) They have organ system level of organization.
(vi) Except leeches, unjointed chitinous setae are often present. Some annelids have
unjointed, locomotory structures, the parapodia (para- parallel, podia-feet),
(vii) Circulatory system is usually closed type. Blood is red due to the presence of respiratory
pigment haemoglobin, found dissolved in the plasma.

(viii) Exeretory system consists of coiled tubular structures, called nephridia. Ammonia is chief
excretory waste.
(ix) The nervous system consists of a nerve ring and a solid, double, midventral nerve cord
with ganglia.
(x) Tactile (touch) receptors, gustatoreceptors (receptors of taste) and photoreceptors
(sensitive to light) are usually found. Some forms have statocysts (balancing organs).
(xi) Both unisexual (e.g., Nereis) and bisexual (e.g., Earthworm, Leech) forms are found

Q.8. Define nematocyst, polyp, medusa, mesoglea and planula.
Ans. Nematocysts: It is stinging organ of coelenterates. It is produced inside a stinging cell
called nematoblast or cnidoblast which comprises hypnotoxic fluid and a long coiled tube for
injecting the fluid into prey or predator. It is used as an organ of offence and defence.
Polyp : It is a free living sessile or mobile zooid or individual of a simple or colonial
coelenterate. It is cylindrical in outline with a terminal mouth surrounded by a ring of tentacles,
e.g., Hydra, Physalia, coral.
Medusa : It is a bell-like or umbrella-shaped free floating or swimming individual (zooid) of
coelenterates.
Mesoglea : It is a non-cellular gelatinous middle layer found between ectoderm and
endoderm as in coelenterates.
