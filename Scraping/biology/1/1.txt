(i) Biological names are generally in Latin or derived from Latin irrespective of their origin.

Q. 4. What processes are basic to taxonomy?

Q. 5. Why was nomenclature necessary?
Ans. Plants and animals in the world are known by their local names. These local names would
vary from place to place. Therefore, there was a need to standardise the naming of living

Q. 7. Define classification. Can it be separated from nomenclature?
Ans. Classification is a method by which organisms on the basis of some easily observable
