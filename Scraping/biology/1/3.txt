Short Answer Questions – II
Q. 1. Differentiate between the following :
(i) Growth in plants and growth in animals
(ii) Growth in unicellular organisms and growth in multicellular organisms
(iii) Catabolism and anabolism.
Ans. (i)
Growth in plants

Growth in animals

Plants grow faster and continuously throughout
their life span.

Animals grow slowly and after reaching
certain size and age, animals stop growing.

(ii)
Growth in unicellular organisms
Growth can be observed in only 𝑖𝑛 − 𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑜
cultures.

Growth in multicellular organisms
Growth can be easily observed in 𝑖𝑛 − 𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑜
as well as in 𝑖𝑛 − 𝑣𝑖𝑣𝑜.

(iii)
Anabolism
The biochemical reactions which are
concerned with the synthesis of complex
substances from simple substances are
collectively called anabolism. E.g.,
photosynthesis.

Catabolism
The biochemical reactions which are
concerned with breakdown of complex
organic substances into simple substances
are collectively called catabolism. E.g.,
respiration.

Q. 2. Distinguish between taxonomy and systematics.
Ans.
S. No.

Taxonomy

1.

It is the study of organisms on the
basis of their characteristics.

2.

It includes morphological and
anatomical features for identification.

Systematics
It is the study of diversity of organisms and all
their comparative and evolutionary
relationships.
It deals with comparative anatomy, ecology,
physiology and bio-chemistry.

Q. 3. What is the correct way of writing a biological name? Explain with example.
Ans. (i) The biological name is written in two words.
(ii) The first is genus and the second represents species. They are printed in italics. Example
𝑃𝑖𝑠𝑢𝑚 𝑠𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑢𝑚 is the scientific name of pea.

(iii) Generic name begins with a capital letter (𝑝𝑖𝑠𝑢𝑚) and the species name begins with a small
letter (𝑠𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑢𝑚).
Q. 4. Taxonomy for a long time was considered as descriptive science. Why?
Ans. (i) Taxonomy: It is the branch of biology dealing with identification, naming and
classification of the organism on the basis of some laws and principles.
(ii) It includes characterization, identification, nomenclature and classification.
(iii) The morphological characters were considered in the beginning to classify organisms.
(iv) The species was considered static and fixed entity.
Q. 5. Give example of three species each belonging to same genera.
Ans. (i) 𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑚 𝑡𝑢𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑚 (potato) and 𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑚 𝑚𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑟𝑎 (brinjal).
(ii) 𝐵𝑟𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑎 𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑎 (cabbage) and 𝐵𝑟𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑎 𝑗𝑢𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑎 (mustard).
(iii) 𝑃𝑎𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑎 𝑙𝑒𝑜 (lion) and 𝑃𝑎𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑎 𝑡𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑠 (tiger).
Q. 6. What are intermediate categories?
Ans. With the discovery of more organisms it is difficult to adjust them to traditional categories.
So, the existing categories have been split by prefixing ‘super’ and ‘sub’ to the existing
categories like sub-kingdom, sub-phylum, super class etc. These are referred as intermediate
categories. This has also facilitated more sound and scientific placement of various taxa.
Q. 7. Write a short note on botanical garden. Name some botanical gardens.
OR
Botanical gardens are living herbaria. Comment.
Ans. (i) A botanical garden is a place for growing flowers for educational purposes for scientific
workers.
(ii) It is also an inspiration for general public to create their interest in plant life.
(iii) It displays different varieties of cultivated plants, medicinal plants and other economic
values.
(iv) A botanical garden also has a herbarium and a library for reference studies.
(v) They are basic sources of information about different types of plants.
Some of these gardens are as follows:
(i) Royal Botanical Garden, Kew (England)
(ii) National Botanical Garden, (Lucknow)
(iii) Indian Botanical Garden, (Kolkata)
(iv) Lloyd Botanical Garden, (Darjeeling).
Q. 8. What are taxonomic aids? Name a few taxonomic aids.
Ans. Taxonomic aids: Techniques, procedures and information collected about the species
that facilitate, identification, naming and classification of organisms are called taxonomic aids.
Some aids are Herbaria, Botanical gardens, zoological parks etc.

Q. 9. Describe the role of museums.
Ans. (i) These have collections of plants and animals.
(ii) These are used to deposit type specimens.
(iii) These are important centers for taxonomic studies.
(iv) These provide information about local fauna and flora as well as of other areas.
Q. 10. Name some zoological parks.
Ans. (i) Zoological park of Kruger (S. Africa).
(ii) Zoological garden of Berlin (Germany).
(iii) Zoo of Kolkata.
(iv) Aquarium of Mumbai.
Q. 11. Describe the taxonomic aids useful in identification of species.
Ans. Flora, manuals, monographs and catalogues are some of the taxonomic aids.
(i) Flora contains the useful account of habitat and distribution of plants of a given area. These
provide the index to the plant species found in a particular area.
(i) Manuals are useful in providing information for the identification of names of species found
in an area.
(iii) Monographs contain all the information about a particular taxon.
(iv) Catalogue is a list that enumerates all the species found in a particular area.
Q. 12. How different specimens are preserved in the museums.
Ans. In museums specimens can be preserved in the following ways:
(i) Most of the specimens are preserved in the containers or jars in preservative solutions.
(ii) Some specimens are preserved in the dried form.
(ii) Insects are preserved in insect boxes.
(iv) Larger animals like birds and mammals are usually stuffed and then preserved.
(v) Museums also have skeletons of animals as specimen.
