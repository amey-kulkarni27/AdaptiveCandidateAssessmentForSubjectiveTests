What are the cell inclusions in a prokaryotic cell?,"(i) Inclusion bodies are storage granules which store reserves. (ii) They are not bounded by any membrane and lie free in the cytoplasm. (iii) The inclusion bodies are of three types-gas vacuoles, inorganic inclusions and food reserves. (iv) Gas vacuoles are permeable to atmospheric gases. (v) Inorganic inclusions are inorganic granules which take different colour with basic dyes. (vi) Food reserve are granules with storage of starch, proteins etc."
Q. 2 Give the difference between cell walls of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.,S. No. (i) (ii) (iii)  Gram positive bacteria Their cell wall is single-layered and100200 A thick. They can be stained by gram stain. The lipid content of the wall is quite low.  Gram negative bacteria Their cell wall consist of two layers and is 70- 120 Å in thickness. They cannot be stained by gram stain. The lipid content of the wall is 20-30% 
Differentiate between exocytosis and endocytosis.,"S. No.  Exocytosis  Endocytosis  (i)  Expulsion of materials from the cell takes place.  In it, cellular active intake of materials takes place.  (ii) (iii)  It destroys vesicles. Primary function of exocytosis is expelling waste.  It creates vesicles. Primary function of endocytosis is getting nutrients. "
Give four differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. 2004]  [Annual Exam. ,"S. No. (i)  Prokaryotic cells True membrane bound nucleus is absent.  Eukaryotic cells True membrane bound nucleus is present.  (ii)  Endoplasmic reticulum, golgi complex, mitochondria, lysosomes, vacuoles and ribosomes are absent.  These cell organelles are present in these cells.  (iii)  Chromosomes formed of DNA is present in the cytoplasm.  Chromosomes formed of DNA are present in the nucleoplasm. "
Draw sketch of T.S. of a chloroplast and label SIX parts in it.   ,Structure of a Chloroplast – 
Draw a well labelled diagram of structure of mitochondrion. Draw a well labelled diagram of mitochondria.    ,
Name and write the function of different kinds of leucoplast in plant cell. 2016]  [KVS ,"Leucoplasts : They are the colourless plastids and do not contain any pigment. They usually perform the function of storage of reserve food material. They are classified into following three types.  (i) Amyloplasts: Amyloplasts are generally found in tubers, endosperms and cotyledons. They store starch as reserve food material. (ii) Aleuroplasts: Aleuroplasts are found in the seeds of Ricinus, maize etc. They store proteins as a reserve food material. (iii) Elaioplasts: Elaioplasts are found in most monocotyledonous plants. They store oil as reserve food material."
Plastids are the cell organelles which are found only in plant cells. Name any two types of plastid and mention the function of each.,"The plastids are flat, circular cytoplasmic cell organelles. Plastids are found only in plant cells and certain protists. Two types of plastids are: (i) Chromoplasts: These are the coloured plastids which have the pigment other than the chlorophyll. These are found in the floral leaves and fruits imparting them different colors for attracting insects and animals for pollination. (ii) Chloroplasts: These are the green plastids found in the green parts of the plants. These plastids are concerned with the manufacture of carbohydrates by photosynthesis."
"Write two functions of each of the following- Golgi complex, Endoplasmic reticulum, plastids","Golgi Complex: Perform packaging of material and is the site for formation of glycoprotein and glycolipids. Endoplasmic reticulum- Synthesis of protein and lipids. Plastid: Storage of protein, site of photosynthesis."
Mention the similarities between mitochondria and chloroplasts.,(i) Presence of double membrane envelope. (ii) Formation of involutions from the inner membrane. (iii) Both are semi-autonomous. (iv) DNA is naked in both and both possess 70S ribosomes. (v) Take part in energy transduction. (vi) Both of them produce ATP.
List the functions of centrioles.,"(i) Centrioles help in cell division by forming spindle fibres that give rise to spindle apparatus during cell division in animal cells. (ii)They form basal bodies which gives rise to cilia and flagella. (iii) Out of two centrioles in a spermatozoan, the distal one give rise to axial filament or tail. "
What is endocytosis? How many types of endocytosis are there?,"Endocytosis is the process of active cellular intake of materials. It involves invagination of a small region of plasma membrane, forming an intracellular membrane bound vesicles. It is of two types: (i) Pinocytosis is a process of intake of droplets of extracellular fluid. (ii) Phagocytosis is a process of intake of solid particles."
What is the importance of active transport?,"S.No. (i)  (ii)  Mitochondria Mitochondria occur in all the eukaryotic cells. It does not trap energy.  The inner membranes of mitochondria are folded into cristae. (iii) Pigments are absent in mitochondria. (iv) During biological oxidation, energy is released and stored in ATP molecules. (v) Thylakoids are absent. (Any three)  Chloroplast Chloroplasts are found in green cells which perform the function of photosynthesis. It traps energy. Cristae are absent. Pigments are always present. ATP is formed in the presence sunlight by thylakoids. Thylakoids are present.  "
