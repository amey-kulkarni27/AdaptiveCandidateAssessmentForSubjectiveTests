What is a cell sap?,The liquid contents in the vacuoles of plant cells are termed as cell sap
Define fertility factor.,It is a factor present on a plasmid which converts the bacterium into a donor and capable of developing sex pili for conjugation. 
What is glycocalyx.,Glycocalyx is the outermost mucilage layer of the cell envelope which consists of noncellulosic polysaccharides with or without proteins in prokaryotic cells.
What is the nature of the cell wall ?,"The plant cell wall is a complex matrix of linked polysaccharides such as cellulose and pectin, forming a thick semi permeable rigid barrier outside the plasma membrane."
Name the site of synthesis of glyolipids in a cell.,Golgi apparatus.
"Name the organelle of the cell, called as' suicidal bags'",Lysosome is called as 'suicidal bags' of the cell.
What is plasmalemma ?,Plasmalemma or plasma membrane or cell membrane is a biomembrane that occurs on the outside of the cytoplasm in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
