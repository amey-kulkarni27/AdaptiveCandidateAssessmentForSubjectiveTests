Ans. Robert Hooke (in 1665) introduced the term cell.
Q. 2. Define totipotency.
Ans. Totipotency is the ability of living cells to form the whole organism unless and until they
have become extremely specialized.
Q. 3. Who proposed the cell theory?

[NCT-2008, 09]

Ans. Matthias Schleiden (1838) and Theodore Schwann (1839).
Q. 4. What are plasmodesmata?
Ans. Protoplasmic or cytoplasmic bridges between adjacent plant cells in the areas of pits are
called as plasmodesmata.
Q. 5. Name two semi-autonomous bodies.
Ans. (i) Chloroplast, (ii) Mitochondria.
Q. 6. What are pili?
Ans. Fili are elongated, tubular structure made up of special protein in bacteria.
Q. 7. What is meant by cell differentiation?
Ans. Cell differentiation is the phase of growth in which a cell acquires a permanent shape
and function along with increase in size.
Q. 8. Who gave the statement Omnis cellula-e cellula'?
Ans. Rudolf Virchow.
Q. 9. Give the significance of glyocalyx.
Ans. It provides protection to the bacterial cells and also help in adhesion.
Q. 10. What are fimbriae?
Ans. Fimbriae are small, bristle like fibres sprouting out of the cell in bacteria.
Q. 11. What is a cell sap?
Ans. The liquid contents in the vacuoles of plant cells are termed as cell sap
Q. 12. Define fertility factor.
Ans. It is a factor present on a plasmid which converts the bacterium into a donor and capable
of developing sex pili for conjugation.

Q. 13. What is glycocalyx.
Ans. Glycocalyx is the outermost mucilage layer of the cell envelope which consists of noncellulosic polysaccharides with or without proteins in prokaryotic cells.
Q. 14. What is the nature of the cell wall ?
Ans. The plant cell wall is a complex matrix of linked polysaccharides such as cellulose and
pectin, forming a thick semi permeable rigid barrier outside the plasma membrane.
Q. 15. Name the site of synthesis of glyolipids in a cell.
Ans. Golgi apparatus.
Q. 16. Name the organelle of the cell, called as' suicidal bags'
Ans. Lysosome is called as 'suicidal bags' of the cell.
Q. 17. What is plasmalemma ?
Ans. Plasmalemma or plasma membrane or cell membrane is a biomembrane that occurs on
the outside of the cytoplasm in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
Q. 18. Name the two subunits of ribosomes.
Ans. The two subunits of ribosomes are larger and smaller subunits.
Q. 19. Name the enzymes present in peroxisomes.
Ans. Oxidases and catalases.
Q. 20. Write the other name of nuclear envelop.
Ans. Karyotheca.
Q. 21. What are cytoskeletal structures?
Ans. The cytoskeletal structure are microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules.
Q. 22. Who gave the term 'chromosome' ?
Ans. Waldeyer (1881),
Q. 23. What is diplosome ?
Ans. A pair of centrioles are called diplosomes.
Q. 24. Name four different forms of lysosomes.
Ans. (i) Primary lysosome, (ii) Secondary lysosome,
(iii) Autophagosomes, (iv) Residual bodies.
Q. 25. Who proposed fluid mosaic model ?
Ans. Singer and G. Nicolson.

Q. 26. Define osmosis.
Ans. Osmosis is a special type of diffusion in which only solvent molecules migrate across a
semipermeable membrane from a region of low solute concentration to a region of high solute
concentration.
Q. 27. what is active transport ?
Ans. Active transport is the movement of material across the membrane against their
concentration or electrochemical gradient. It requires energy in the form of ATP for this
process.
Q. 28. What is the function of contractile vacuole ?
Ans. Osmoregulation (water balance).
Q. 29. What is desmotubule ?
Ans. A fine cytoplasmic canal lined by plasma membrane and has ER.
Q. 30. Name the ions which help in association of two ribosomal sub-units.
Ans. Mg2+ ions.
