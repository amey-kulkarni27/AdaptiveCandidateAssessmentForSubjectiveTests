Very Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. What happen when the secretion of hormone ADH is inhibited? (KVS Agra 2016)

the urine output and the osmolarity of blood increases.

convert stored glucagon into glucose and increases the level of blood glucose.

balance in blood. Name them.
(DDE 2017)
Ans. Œ± - cell: Glucagon
Œ≤ ‚Äì cell: Insulin

Q. 18. Why do the bones of a pregnant women soften, if she does not take sufficient
calcium in her food?

vessels thereby reducing blood pressure.
