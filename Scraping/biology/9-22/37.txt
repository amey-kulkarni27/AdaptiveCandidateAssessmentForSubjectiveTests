Q.11. Mention the best defined function of manganese in photosynthesis.
Ans. It is necessary for splitting of water to liberate oxygen (photolysis) during
photosynthesis.
Q. 12. What is premature abscission ?
Ans. Fall of leaves, flowers or fruits before their maturation is called as premature
abscission.

Ans. The plants absorb phosphorus in the form of inorganic monovalent H 2PO4- or divalent
(H3PO4)-2 ions.
Q.14. On what factors does utility of micro-elements depends ?
Ans. The utility of micro-elements depends upon the level of deficiency in the soil and the pH
of the soil.

Q. 26 What is critical concentration ?

[KVS 2012-13]

Ans. The concentration of the essential element below which growth in plant is reduced is
termed as critical concentration.
Q. 27. What is symbiosis ?
Ans. Two organisms that live in close physical association and are of mutual benefit to each
other, are called symbionts. This condition is known as symbiosis.
Q. 28. How insectivorous plants fulfil their nitrogen requirements ?
Ans. Insectivorous plants fulfil their nitrogen requirements from insects and small animak
trapped by their leaves.
Q. 29. Name the hydrolytic enzyme found in saprophytes.
Ans. The hydrolytic enzyme found in saprophytes are-cellulases, chitinases, amylases,
proteinases.
Q. 30. What is the cause of toxic effect in plants?
Ans. Toxic effects may be due to direct excess of the micro nutrient or its interference in the
absorption and function of the other nutrients.
Q. 31. What is premature abscission ?
Ans. Fall of leaves, flowers or fruits before their maturation is called as premature abscission.
Q. 32. What happens to nitrogenase in the absence of leghaemoglobin in the root
nodules?
Ans. The nitrogenase enzyme is oxidised as it is very sensitive to oxygen.

[KVS-2012-

Ans. Conversion of ammonia into nitrites and nitrates is called nitrification whereas reduction
of nitrate back into nitrogen is called denitrification.
