Short Answer Type Questions-II
Q.1. How nerve impulses are conducted in non- myelinated nerves? [KVS Agra 2016]
Ans. Transmission of nerve impulse through non-myelinated nerves:
(i) In resting stage, the Nat ions are pumped out from the axoplasm. It needs energy to work
normally.
(ii) Thus axon membrane is electronegative inside and electropostive outside, this is called
resting potential. In this state the nerve is said to be in polarized state.
(iii) When the nerve fibre is stimulated, it cause electrochemical disturbance in the nerve fibre,
a change in potential. This change is called action potential.
(iv) Thus, Na+ migrate into the axoplasm and Cl‚àí ions diffuses out. Thus negativity is
increased outside and positivity is increased inside. This is called depolarisation.
(v) Depolarisation progresses along the nerve fibre in both directions from the point of
stimulus.
Q. 2. Write short notes on hind brain. [KVS Agra 2017]
Ans. Hind Brain: It consists of three regions: pons, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata.
(i) Pons is band of nerve fibers that lies between medulla oblongata and midbrain. It connects
the lateral parts of cerebellar hemisphere together.
(ii) Cerebellum is large and well-developed part of hindbrain. It is located below the posterior
sides of cerebral hemispheres and above the medulla oblongata. It is responsible for
maintaining posture and equilibrium of the body.
(iii) Medulla oblongata is the posterior and simplest part of the brain. It is located beneath
the cerebellum. Its lower end extends in the form of spinal cord and leaves the skull through
foramen magnum.
Q.3. How are neurons classified based on the number of axons and dentrites? [KVS
Silchar 2017]
Ans. The structural classification of neurons depends upon the number of dendrites extending
from the cell body.
(i) Multipolar neurons have one axon and several dendrites; the majority of neurons in the
spinal cord and brain are multipolar.
(ii) Bipolar neurons have only two processes: a single dendrite and an axon. Biopolar neurons
are found in the sense organs-and in the retina of the eye and in olfactory cells.
(iii) Unipolar neurons lack dendrites and have a single axon, and are also sensory neurons.
Q. 4. What are the different parts of fore brain?
Ans. Fore brain (Prosencephalon):

(i) Olfactory lobes: Each lobe consists of two parts, an anterior olfactory bulb and a posterior
olfactory tract. They are fully covered by the cerebral hemispheres.
(ii) Cerebrum : The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain. It consists of left and
right hemispheres connected by a large bundle of myelinated fiber‚Äôs, the corpus callosum and
other smaller fibre bundles. The outer portion of cerebrum is called the cerebral cortex that
makes up the grey matter of the cerebrum. There are three kinds of cortex: sensory, motor
and associative. Beneath the grey matter, the large concentration of medullated nerve fiber‚Äôs
gives this tissue an opaque white appearance, collectively called white matter. Each cerebral
hemisphere is divided into four lobes : frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobe.
(iii) Diencephalon : Its main parts are epithalamus, thalamus and hypothalamus.
Epithalamus is thin and not formed of nervous tissue. Hypothalamus is relatively small but is
highly vascular. The thalamus lies superior to mid brain is composed primarily of grey matter.
Q.5. What are the basic functions of nervous system?
Ans. The nervous system of higher animals performs three basic functions:
(i) They receive sensory input from internal and external environment by nerves.
(ii) They process the input information; and
(iii) They respond to the stimuli transmitting motor commands to determine the response of
the body parts or cells.
Q. 6. In how many parts human nervous system is divided?
Ans. Human nervous system is divisible into three main parts:
(i) Central Nervous System: It is a hollow, dorsally placed structure lying along the middorsal axis of the body. It comprises the brain and spinal cord.
(ii) Peripheral Nervous System: The nerves arising from the central nervous system
constitute the peripheral nervous system. The nerves originate from the brain and spinal cord
and are known as cranial nerves and spinal nerves respectively.
(iii) Autonomic Nervous System: It controls and co-ordinates organs which are under
involuntary control. It consists of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.

Q.12. Define nerve impulse and explain its conduction [KVS 2007, 2010, 11]
Ans. Nerve impulse Nerve impulse is any signal initiated by the stimulus at the receptor.
Nerve cells are excitable.
Conduction of Nerve Impulse in Non-Myelinated Nerve Fibre: It is divided into three
phases:
(i) Resting phase: During this phase, there is more ùëÅùëé+ ions on outside of axon membrane
in ECF than inside of the axon membrane. ùêæ + ions move out and the membrane is positively
charged outside and negatively charged inside. Thus, membrane is in resting potential (-80
mV).
(ii) Action Potential: It is other name of nerve impulse with resting potential. When the
stimulus is applied, the axon membrane is negatively charged outside and positively charged
inside. It is called depolarized or an action potential (+30 mV). The electrogenic pump expels
three Na+ for every two ùêæ + imported. ùëÅùëé+ ùêæ + ions transmembrane pumps are very important
in membrane potential.
(iii) Recovery Phase: During this phase depolarized point becomes repolarized and ùëÅùëé+ ions
move to outside while ùêæ + ions move inside.

Q.13. What do you call the conduction of impulse along a myelinated nerve fibre? [KV
2007, KV 2008]
OR
Why is the mode of conduction of electrical impulse along the myelinated neuron is
advantageous to a non-myelinated neuron?
What is this type of conduction called?
Ans. (i) Along a myelinated nerve fibre, the conduction of impulse is called saltatory
conduction.
(ii) This is so because the ionic changes and consequent depolarization takes place only at
the nodes of Ranvier free from myelin sheath leading to the jumping of action potential from
one node to the next.

Q.14. How nerve fibres gets terminated?
Ans. Nerve fibres terminate in three ways:
(i) The axon of one neuron ends on the dendrites of the next neuron. Such a junction is called
synapse.
(ii) The axon of a neuron terminates on either a muscle fibre, or a gland cell. When it ends on
a muscle fibre, it forms the neuromotor junction. The contact between a neuron and glandular
cells is called neuroglandular junction.
(iii) Many nerve fibres, for example in the skin, divides into fine branches known as the
sensory nerve endings.
Q.15.What are the main properties of nervous tissue?
Ans. The nervous tissue has two outstanding properties excitability and conductivity.
(i) Excitability: It is the ability of the nerve cells and fibres to enter into an active state called
the state of excitation in response to a stimulus. Excitation arises at the receptors on account
of various stimuli such as light, temperature, chemical, electrical or pressure which constantly
act on the organisms.
(ii) Conductivity: The excitation does not remain at the site of its origin. It is transmitted along
nerve fibres. The transmission of excitation in a particular direction is called conductivity

Ans. (i) Hypothalamus integrates and controls the visceral activities.
(ii) It maintains homeostasis.
(iii) It provides anatomical connection between the nervous and endocrine systems by its
relationship to the pituitary gland.
(iv) Hypothalamus is thermoregulatory centre. Hence it is called "thermostat" of the body. It
keeps body temperature at roughly 37¬∞C by means of a complex thermostat system.
(v) It is also associated with behavioural activities.

Q 20. Discuss the role of middle ear in hearing. [DDE 2017]
Ans. Middle ear: The middle ear contains three ossicles called malleus, incus and stapes
which are attached to one another in a chain-like fashion. The malleus is attached to the

tympanic membrane and the stapes is attached to the oval window of the cochlea. The ear
ossicles increase the efficiency of transmission of sound waves to the inner ear.
Eustachian tube help in equalising the pressure of either side of ear drum.

(iii) Supports the lens; and
(iv) Refract the light rays to focus on retina.
(Any three)
Functions of vitreous humour:
(i) Helps in maintaining shape of the eye;
(ii) Supports retina and lens; and
(iii) Refracts the light rays.
Q.22. What is a reflex arc? And how many parts does it consists of?
Ans. The path travelled by an impulse in a reflex action is called the reflex arc. It consists of
five parts:
(i) A receptor or skin, the neurons of which start a sensory impulse.
(ii) An afferent nerve, which brings sensory impulse from the receptor to the central nervous
system.
(iii) The neurons present in the spinal cord change the sensory impulse into the motor
impulse.
(iv) An efferent nerve, which carries the motor impulses from the spinal cord to the specific
effectors like muscles fibres or gland cells.
(v) An effector, where impulse terminates and response is given.
Q. 23. What is meant by 'reflex action'? Give one example. Name the components of a
reflex arc in proper sequence from the receptor upto the effector.

unconscious level by stimulating specific receptors. Reflex action is rapid and automatic
response. ùê∏. ùëî., peristalsis, respiration, watering in mouth etc.
Components of a Reflex Arc: It includes
(i) receptors,

muscle/gland.
Q.24. Explain the mechanism of reflex action. [NCT-2007]
Ans. (i) Reflex action is a form of animal behavior in which the stimulation of a sensory organ
(receptor) results in the activity of some organ without the intervention of will.
(ii) For a reflex action five things are normally essential:
(a) receptor,
(b) sensory nerve fibres,
(c) a part of the central nervous system,
(d) motor nerve fibres and
(e) effector organ such as muscles and glands.
(iii) The sensory nerve fibres bring sensory impulses from the receptor organ to the central
nervous system.
(iv) The motor nerve fibres relay the motor impulses from the central nervous system to the
effector organs.
Q.25. Why does your mouth usually waters at the sight of tasty food? Give some other
examples also.
Ans. It is due to the reflex action. Reflex is ‚Äúan involuntary action performed by muscles under
the direction of spinal cord in response to the stimulus". In short, reflex actions are automatic
responses to stimulus. They are of definite and mechanical type.
Some other example of reflex action:
(i) Narrowing of the pupil of the eye when strong light falls upon it.
(ii) When a hot object is touched accidentally by our hand, it is withdrawn at once.
(iii) Flow of bile from the gall bladder into the duodenum.
