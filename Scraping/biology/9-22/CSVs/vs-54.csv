What does the T wave in a normal electrocardiogram indicates ?,"The T-wave represents the return of the ventricles from excited to the normal state i.e., repolarization takes place. It marks the end of systole."
What do you understand by stroke volume ?,"During a cardiac cycle, each ventricle pumps out approximately 70 ml. of blood which is called the stroke volume."
Mention the important functions of the systemic circulation ?,The systemic circulation provides nutrients O 2 and other essential substances to the tissues and takes CO 2 and other harmful substances away for elimination. 
What is hypertension ?,The increase in blood pressure is called hypertension.
What is atrial pulse ?,It is the wave of distention that passes along the arteries immediately following the ventricular systole.
Why lymphatic circulation takes place very slowly ?,It is because lymphatic circulation occurs due to squeezing action of surrounding muscles and not by the heart.
What is coronary circulation ?,The flow of oxygenated blood from the ascending aorta to the heart muscles and the return of deoxygenated blood from the heart muscles to the right atrium is called coronary circulation.
What is a heart block ?,"It is a condition in which impulses are interrupted at any point along the conducting system of the heart. Thus, impulses do not follow the normal conduction pathway."
What is the importance of ECG ?,The importance of ECG is that it gives accurate information about the heart. It is of great diagnostic value in cardiac diseases.
