17,Q. 19. Where is the basian valve located ?,Ans. The right atrium receives the opening of coronary sinus which is known as the basian valve.
18,Q. 20. What is the function of pericardium ?,Ans. The pericardium protects the heart from shocks and mechanical injuries and also allows free movement of the heart.
19,Q. 21. What are the constituents of lymphatic system ?,"Ans. The constituents of lymphatic system are lymphatic capillaries, lymphatic vessels, lymphatic nodes and lymphatic ducts."
20,Q. 22. What are lacteals ?,Ans. The lymphatic capillaries of intestine absorbs the digested fats. They are milky in appearance a are called as lacteals.
21,Q. 23. What stimulates the waves of contraction in atria and which way the blood moves ?,"Ans. The atria contracts due to a wave of contraction, stimulated by the SA node. The blood is forced into the ventricles as the bicuspid and tricuspid valves are opened. "

26,Q. 28. Write two forms of lymphocytes.,Ans. The two forms of lymphocytes are: B-lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte.
27,Q. 29. Why do we consider blood as a connective tissue ?,"Ans. Because it connects various parts of the body and contains plasma and the formed elements such as RBCs, WBCs, blood platelets etc."
28,Q. 30. What is joint diastole?,"Ans. During blood circulation when both the atria and ventricles are in relaxed phase, it is called joint diastole."
29,Q. 31. What is heamolysis ?,Ans. Heamolysis is the destruction of RBCs.
30,Q. 32. Where does the cardiac impulse originates ?,Ans. The cardiac impulse originates from Sino-atrial node at the top of right atria.
31,Q. 33. What does the T wave in a normal electrocardiogram indicates ?,"Ans. The T-wave represents the return of the ventricles from excited to the normal state i.e., repolarization takes place. It marks the end of systole."
32,Q. 34. What do you understand by stroke volume ?,"Ans. During a cardiac cycle, each ventricle pumps out approximately 70 ml. of blood which is called the stroke volume."
33,Q. 35. Mention the important functions of the systemic circulation ?,Ans. The systemic circulation provides nutrients O 2 and other essential substances to the tissues and takes CO 2 and other harmful substances away for elimination. 
34,Q. 36. What is hypertension ?,Ans. The increase in blood pressure is called hypertension.
35,Q. 37. What is atrial pulse ?,Ans. It is the wave of distention that passes along the arteries immediately following the ventricular systole.
36,Q. 38. Why lymphatic circulation takes place very slowly ?,Ans. It is because lymphatic circulation occurs due to squeezing action of surrounding muscles and not by the heart.
37,Q. 39. What is coronary circulation ?,Ans. The flow of oxygenated blood from the ascending aorta to the heart muscles and the return of deoxygenated blood from the heart muscles to the right atrium is called coronary circulation.
38,Q. 40. What is a heart block ?,"Ans. It is a condition in which impulses are interrupted at any point along the conducting system of the heart. Thus, impulses do not follow the normal conduction pathway."
39,Q. 41. What is the importance of ECG ?,Ans. The importance of ECG is that it gives accurate information about the heart. It is of great diagnostic value in cardiac diseases.
