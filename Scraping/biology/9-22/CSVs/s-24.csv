0,Q. 2. What is water potential? What is the relationship between water potential with solute potential and pressure? ,"Ans. Water potential: It is the difference in the free energy and chemical potential per unit molal volume of water in a solution over its pure state at the same temperature and pressure. Chemical potential of pure water at normal temperature and pressure is zero. It is denoted by Œ® w. Solute potential: All solutions have lower water potential than their pure form. Thus the water potential is inversely proportional to solute concentration, because free energy of water decreases. Pressure potential: Pressure potential or turgor pressure is the pressure exerted by protoplast on cell wall. Pressure potential is + ùë£ùëí and denoted by Œ® p.= Œ® Œ∏.= Œ® c."
1,Q. 3. How many types of membrane are found on the basis of their permeability?,Ans. (i) Impermeable membrane: These do not allow the passage of substances through them. (ii) Permeable membrane : These allow the passage of all types of substances through them. (iii) Semi-permeable membrane : These are the membrane which permit the movement of only solvent molecules. (iv) Differentially permeable membrane : These membrane allow selective passage of solutes through them. (Any three)
2,Q. 4. What are the factors controlling osmosis?,Ans. The factors controlling osmosis are as follows : (i) Presence of a semipermeable membrane. (ii) Concentration gradient of dissolved solute on the two sides of the semi-permeable membrane. (iii) Difference in pressure. 
3,Q. 5. Give an account of imbibition.,"Ans. Imbibition : (i) Imbibition is a special type of diffusion. In this process, water is absorbed by solids and colloids, causing an enormous increase in volume. (ii) It is the phenomenon of adsorption of water or any other liquid by the solid particles of a substance without forming a solution. (iii) Imbibition is along the concentration gradient and depends upon affinity between adsorbent and liquid being adsorbed."
4,Q. 6. Write a short note on plasmolysis ?,"Ans. It is the process of shrinkage of protoplasm in a cell, away from its cell wall and toward the center. It occurs because of the movement of water from the intracellular space to the outer-cellular space. This happens when the plant cell is placed in a hypertonic solution that is solution having more solute concentration than the cell cytoplasm. This causes the water to move out of the cell (endosmosis) and toward the solution. The cytoplasm of the cell shrinks and the cell is said to be plasmolysed."
5,Q. 7. Differentiate between turgor pressure and osmotic pressure.,Ans. S.No. (i)  (ii)  (iii)  Turgor pressre It is the pressure (hydrostatic) which develops in the cell due to the osmotic entry of water into it. Turgor pressure maintains the shape and size of plant parts. A fully turgid cell has maximum turgor pressure. It is designated as TP.  Osmotic pressure It is the actual pressure which develops in a solution if it is separated from the water of semipermeable membrane. Osmotic pressure is measured by bar and it is equal to the osmotic potential having a positive value. It is designated as OP. 
6,Q. 8. What do you understand by mass or bulk flow ?,"Ans. Mass flow is the movement of substance in bulk from one point to another as a result of pressure difference between the two points. In mass flow all the substances dissolved or suspended in solution travel at the same pace, which is different from diffusion where substances move independently according to their concentration gradient."
7,Q. 9. Distinguish between the following: (i) Exosmosis and Endosmosis. (ii) Plasmolysis and Deplasmolysis. (iii) Active and Passive Transport. ,"Ans. (i) S.No. Endosmosis (i) It is the movement of water molecules from the cell to the exterior.  Endosmosis It is the movement of water molecules into the cell from outside.  (ii)  It takes place when a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution.  It takes place when a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution.  (iii)  Turgor pressure on the cell wall decreases, e.g., crenation of RBCs when kept in concentrated sugar solution.  Turgor pressure on the cell wall increases, e.g., swelling of raisins when placed in water.  (ii) S.No. Plasmolysis (i) It is the shrinkage of the protoplast of the cell from its cell wall.  Deplasmolysis It is the It is the swelling of the cytoplasm of a plasmolyzed cell.  (ii)  It takes place when a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution.  It takes place when a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution.  (iii)  It takes place due to exosmosis e.g., when grapes are placed in honey.  It takes place due to endosmosis. e.g., swelling of raisins when placed in water.  (iii) S.No. Active Transport (i) This is a rapid process.  Passive Transport This is a slow process.  (ii)  Energy is needed.  No need of energy.  (iii)  It is a vital process.  It is a physical process.  (iv)  Movement in one direction only.  Movement in both direction.  (v)  Requires carrier proteins.  Does not require carrier proteins.  (vi)  Movement of metabolites against concentration gradient.  Movement of metabolites along concentration gradient. "
8,Q. 10. What is imbibition ? State two conditions essential for imbibition. 2008]  [NCT- ,Ans. Imbibition is the diffusion of water along a gradient into an adsorbent. Two conditions necessary for imbibition are: (i) Water potential gradient between the surface of the adsorbent and the liquid imbibed.  (ii) Affinity between the adsorbent and the imbibed liquid.
9,Q. 11. How does the structure of stomata help in its opening and closing.,"Ans. The immediate cause of the opening and closing of the stomata is a change in the turgidity of the guard cells. The inner wall of each guard cell, towards the pore is thick and elastic whereas the outerwall is thin. When turgidity increases within the two guard cells flanking each stomatal pore, the thin outer walls bulge out and force the inner walls into a crescent shape. The opening and closing of the stoma is also aided due to the orientation of the microfibrils in the cell walls of the guard cells. Cellulose microfibrils are oriented radially rather than longitudinals making it easier for the stoma to open."
10,Q. 12. How do rise in temperature and wind velocity affect transpiration ? Write any two adaptations shown by plants to reduce transpiration.,"Ans. (i) Temperature: If the temperature is more, the rate of transpiration increases. An increase in the temperature of leaf increases the rate of transpiration. (ii) Wind velocity : During high wind, the transpiration becomes very active because the water vapour around the leaves is instantly removed. At very high wind velocity, the stomata are closed because of rapid loss of water from the guard cells and the rate of transpiration is declined. Two adaptations shown by plants to reduce transpiration are: (i) Reduction in the surface of leaves: The leaves are modified into spines, hence no transpiration takes place. (ii) Sunken stomata : In some, the stomata get sunk. This also reduces the rate of transpiration. e.g., Nerium and Agave."
11,Q. 13. What are the functions of turgor pressure ? Write the significance of turgor pressure.,Ans. Functions of turgor pressure are : (i) It keeps the cells and their organelles stretched. (ii) It provides support to non-woody tissues like parenchyma. (iii) Turgor pressure is essential for cell enlargement during growth. (iv) It keeps the leaves fully expanded and property oriented to light. (v) The opening and closing of stomata are caused by gain and loss of turgidity. (Any three)
12,Q. 14. State the various features of leaves that increase or decrease transpiration.,"Ans. (i) The lower surface of a dorsoventral dicotyledonous leaf possesses greater number of stomata. In an isobilateral / monocot leaf, the number of stomata are equal on both of its surfaces. (ii) The transpiration from a leaf depends on thickness of stationary layer of air/boundary  layer that is in immediate contact with leaf. (iii) It depends on surface features of the leaf such as hardness of the leaf surface as well as wind speed. (iv) The thinner the boundary layer, the greater is transpiration. (v) There must be diffusion gradient between boundary layer and atmosphere on one side and stomatal cavity on the other side for transpiration. (Any three)"
13,Q. 15. What is guttation ? How it is affected by root pressure ?,"Ans. The process of exudation of liquid drops from the margins of the leaves through hydathodes is called guttation. (a) When root pressure is high and transpiration is low, herbaceous plants may loose small quantities of water in the form of drops. (b) The rate of guttation increases with the decrease in root pressure due to less absorption of water.  "
