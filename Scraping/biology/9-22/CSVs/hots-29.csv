Persons suffering from very low blood pressure pass no urine. Why? What suggestion would you offer for the removal of waste products from the blood in such a situation?,"It is true that a person suffering from very low blood pressure does not pass sufficient urine. The reason for this is, the blood to pass through the glomerulus of the nephron must have required amount of pressure in it. If the pressure is not sufficient it will not flow through the glomerulus and filtration would not take place, hence no urine would be formed. This is quite harmful to the person as waste products go on accumulating in the body. To avoid this, a person should be advised to take sufficient amount of water and medicines to keep the blood pressure at an optimum level."
"Suppose the kidneys of a person are damaged, can you predict what is going to happen to him?","The kidneys are considered as master chemists of the body. (i) If they are damaged, it would disturb the normal functioning of the life processes. (ii) Due to the effect of toxins produced by some bacteria the filters of tiny uriniferous tubules are damaged. (iii) They become perforated with larger holes and allow blood cells, and proteins to pass through them along with the urea and water during filtration of blood in formation of urine."
An aquarium fish and a pigeon were fed on protein diet. In what different forms would they excrete their nitrogenous wastes? Why do they excrete so differently?,An aquarium fish excrete ammonia whereas a pigeon excretes uric acid. Ammonia is highly toxic and needs to be eliminated as rapidly as it is formed. A fish living in water have immediate access to water and can eliminate ammonia easily and directly. Ammonia being soluble in water requires a large volume of water for its elimination which a fish can afford. A bird has very less access to water and can conserve water in its body by eliminating insoluble uric acid crystals.
