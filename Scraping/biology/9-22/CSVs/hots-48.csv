0,Q. 1. What is oxygen debt? Explain.,"Ans. (i) The muscles fails to get sufficient oxygen during strenuous exercise to fulfil their energy requirements and contracts anaerobically. It accumulates lactic acid produced by glycolysis. The oxygen consumption of muscles exceed during recovery, known as oxygen debt of the muscle. (ii) This oxygen is used in oxidising the accumulated lactic acid aerobically and restoring ATP in muscle fibre."
1,Q. 2. Why a red muscle fibre works for a prolonged period while a white muscle fibre suffers from fatigue after a shorter work?,"Ans. (i) Red muscle fibres are rich in myoglobin and contain large number of mitochondria. (ii) Function of myoglobin is to bind and store oxygen and oxymyoglobin. (iii) During muscle contraction oxygen is released from the oxymyoglobin. (iv) Red muscle fibres produce energy only under aerobic conditions so very less amount of lactic acid gets accumulated in the muscle. Hence these muscles can work for a prolonged period. (v) White muscle fibre, myoglobin is absent and there are very less number of mitochondria so they depend on aerobic glycolysis for their energy production. (vi) As a result of this, large amount of lactic acid gets accumulated in the muscle and hence these muscle gets fatigued soon.  "
