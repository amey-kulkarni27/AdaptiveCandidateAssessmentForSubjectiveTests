0,Q. 1. What do you understand by diffusion pressure?,Ans. The pressure exerted by the tendency of the particles to diffuse from the region of its higher concentration to the region of its lower concentration is called diffusion pressure. It is proportional to the concentration of diffusing particles.
1,Q. 2. Define membrane permeability. On what factors does it depend?,"Ans. Membrane permeability is the ability of a membrane to allow passage of gases, liquids, solutes through it. It is dependent upon two factors: (i) Nature of membrane (composition), (ii) Nature of passing substance."
2,Q. 3. What is reverse osmosis? How it is useful?,Ans. It is the expulsion of pure water from a solution through a semi-permeable membrane under the influence of pressure higher than the osmotic pressure of the solution. Use: Reverse osmosis is used in removing salts from saline water as well as extra purification of water.
3,Q. 4. Write a short note on deplasmolysis.,"Ans. Deplasmolysis: (i) If a plasmolysed cell is placed in pure water or hypotonic solution, endosmosis takes place. (ii) The protoplast attains its original shape and the cell regain its original size. (iii) The swelling up of a plasmolysed protoplast due to endosmosis under the influence of a hypotonic solution or water is called deplasmolysis. (iv) It is possible immediately after plasmolysis otherwise the cell protoplast becomes perma nently damaged."
4,Q. 5. Briefly describe two pathways through which mineral nutrients absorbed by roots are carried to the xylem. ,Ans. Apoplast pathway : The ions enter the cell wall of epidermis and move across the cell wall from epidermis to xylem and finally gets accumulated there. Symplast pathway: The ions enter the cytoplasm of epidermis and move across the cytoplasm of epidermis to cytoplasm of pericycle through phasmodesmata and finally to xylem vessels.
5,Q. 6. Differentiate between apoplast and symplast pathway. ,Ans. Difference between apoplast and symplast pathway is as follows: S.No. (i)  Apoplast It is the pathway of water which occurs through cell walls and intercellular spaces.  Symplast It occurs through interconnected protoplasts. The protoplast of adjacent cells is connected via plasmodesmata  (ii)  The apoplastic pathway is continuous and provide least resistant to the movement of water.  The symplastic pathway is slow because of cell membrane and them organelles. 
6,Q. 7. Represent diagrammatically the apoplastic and symplastic pathways of water transport in plants. [KVS Agra 2017] Mention the two pathways of water movements in root cells with diagrams. [KVS 2015],Ans. Two pathways of water movement are apoplastic and symplastic.
