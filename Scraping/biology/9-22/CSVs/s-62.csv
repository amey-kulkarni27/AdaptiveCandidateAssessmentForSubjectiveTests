5,Q. 7. The ammonia that is absorbed by the plants is used to synthesize various amino acids. Explain the main two ways by which this is done. [KVS Silchar 2017],"Ans. At physiological pH, the ammonia is protonated to form NH4+ (ammonium) ion while most of the plants can assimilate nitrate as well as ammonium ions, the latter is quite toxic to plants and hence cannot accumulate in them. There are two main ways by which this can take place : (i) Reductive amination : In these processes, ammonia reacts with α-ketoglutaric acid and The two most important amides - asparagine and glutamine - found in plants are a structural part of proteins. They are formed from two amino acids, namely aspartic acid and glutamic acid, respectively, by addition of another amino group to each. The hydroxyl part of the acid is replaced by another NH 2-radicle."
6,Q. 8. What is non-symbiotic N2 fixation? Give examples of some microorganism. ,"Ans. When atmospheric nitrogen fixation takes place by free living bacteria or cyanobacteria without showing any mutual relationship with any other species is called non-symbiotic  nitrogen fixation. E.g. 𝐴𝑧𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟, 𝐴𝑛𝑎𝑏𝑎𝑒𝑛𝑎, 𝑁𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐."
7,"Q. 9. (i) Name the enzyme involved in nitrogen fixation by 𝑹𝒉𝒊𝒛𝒐𝒃𝒊𝒖𝒎. (ii) Name the pigment seen in root nodules of leguminous plants and explain its role in nitrogen fixation. (iii) Explain the two ways by which NH4+ is used to synthesise amino acids in plants.  forms glutamic acid as indicated in the equation given below: + 𝒂-ketoglutaric acid + NH + NAD 𝟒  (ii) Transamination: It involves the transfer of amino group from one amino acid to the keto group of a keto acid. Glutamic acid is the main amino acid from which the transfer of NH 2, the amino group takes place and other amino acids are formed through transamination. The enzyme transaminase catalyses all such reactions. For example, ",Ans. (i) Nitrogenase (ii) Leghaemoglobin : Leghaemoglobin is pinkish pigment found around bacteroides of 𝑅ℎ𝑖𝑧𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑢𝑚 inside the cells of legume roots that protects the nitrogenase from oxygen. Leghaemoglobin absorbs oxygen and thus it creates anaerobic conditions inside the root nodule. The enzyme nitrogenase is functional only under anaerobic conditions. (iii) Ammonium ion is converted into amino acids by two methods : Reductive amination and Transamination.
8,Q. 10. What is nitrification Name two nitrifying bacteria of soil.,Ans. Nitrification refers to the phenomenon of conversion of ammonia into NO 2- (nitrite) and then into NO 3- (nitrates). Two nitrifying bacteria are : (i) 𝑁𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑠: It converts ammonía (NH 3) into nitrites (NO 2-). 2NH3 + 3O2 → 2H+ 2H2O + 2NO2(ii) 𝑁𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟 : It converts nitrites into nitrates. 2NO2- + O2 → 2NO3 
9,Q. 11. What do you understand by reduction of nitrite?,"Ans. (i) Reduction of nitrite to ammonia is carried out by an enzyme called nitrite reductase. (ii) This enzyme does not contain molybdenum but requires copper and iron as activators. It requires a reducing power, which is NADPH. (iii) The process of reduction also requires ferredoxin which occurs in the higher plants mostly in the leaves and hence this step is carried out in the leaves."
10,"Q. 12. In the root nodules of leguminous plants, what is the role of nitrogenase and leghaemoglobin?",Ans. (i) The enzyme nitrogenase in root nodules of legume plants catalyses the conversion of atmospheric N2 to ammonia (NH 3).

No. (i)  Chlorosis The yellowing of leaves due to reduction of chlorophyll content in a green part is known as chlorosis.  Necrosis The death of a cell or a group of cells in a living plant is known as necrosis.  (ii)  It is caused due to the deficiency of Magnesium, Sulphur, Iron, Manganese and Nitrogen.  It is caused due to deficiency of Ca, Mg, Cu and K.  (ii) S.No. (i)  Mottling It is the patchy appearance of green and non-green areas of a leaf.  Interveinal chlorosis The yellowing of leaf between the veins is called interveinal chlorosis.  (ii)  It is caused due to the deficiency of zinc and molybdenum.  It is caused due to the deficiency of iron and molybdenum.  (iii) S.No. (i)  Haemoglobin It is found in animals.  Leghaemoglobin It is found in root nodules of leguminous plants.

12,Q. 14. Describe the process of progressive reduction of one molecule of nitrogen during fixation in leguminous plants.,"Ans. Process of progressive reduction of one molecule of nitrogen during fixation in leguminous plants: (i) The nodules are the sites of nitrogen fixation in leguminous plants. Nodules contain leghaemoglobin (Lb) and the enzymenitrogenase. (ii) Leghaemoglobin is a pink colour pigment similar to haemoglobin of vertebrates and functions as an oxygen-scavenger and protects the nitrogenase from oxygen. (iii) During this process, a dinitrogen (N ≡ N) molecule is reduced by the addition of hydrogen atoms into two molecules of ammonia catalysed by the nitrogenase enzyme. (iv) It requires (a) a strong reducing agent, (b) energy in the form of ATP to transfer the hydrogen atom and (c) the enzyme systems. The reaction is as follows: N2 + 8e- + 8H+ + 16 АТР → 2NH3 + H2 + 16 ADP + 16 Pi"
13,"Q. 15. The toxicity symptoms of manganese are actually the combined deficiency symptoms of iron, magnesium and calcium. Explain.","Ans. The prominent symptom of manganese toxicity is the appearance of brown spots surrounded by chlorotic veins. This is due to reduction in uptake of iron and magnesium, inhibition of binding of magnesium to specific enzymes and inhibition of calcium translocation in shoot apex. Therefore, excess of manganese causes deficiency of iron, magnesium and calcium. Thus the toxicity symptoms of Mn are actually the combined deficiency symptoms of Fe, Mg and Ca."
14,Q. 16. Describe two important functions of each of the element P Fe and Zn in green plants. Mention deficiency symptoms of any two of these elements.,"Ans. Phosphorus (P) : It forms the constituent of cell membrane protein, nucleic acids, ATP, NADP and energy rich compounds. Deficiency symptoms : It causes poor growth, leaves become dull green and chlorosis occurs. Iron (Fe): It helps in the synthesis cytochrome and ferredoxin. It activates enzyme catalase. Deficiency symptoms : It results in chlorosis. Zine (Zn) : It activates enzyme synthesis. It is a constituent of carbonic anhydrase. This is a also cnstituent of dehydrogenase. Deficiency symptoms : Leaves are not properly formed.  "
