"(i) Give the general structure of amino acid. (ii) Classify amino acids on the basis of number of amino group and carboxylic group. Give example for each type. (iii) Illustrate the structure of glycine, alanine and serine.   ","Ans.(i) They are the organic acids (with carboxylic group -COOH) having amino group (-NH2 ) generally attached to ùëé-carbon next to the carboxylic group. The ùëé-carbon also bears a variable hydrocarbon or alkyl group R and hydrogen. Amino acids are, therefore, substituted methanes where the four substituted groups occupy the four valency positions. R is represented by H in glycine, methyl group in alanine (ii) Depending upon the number of amino group and carboxylic groups, amino acids have been classified as: (a) Neutral amino acids: The neutral amino acids have one amino group and one carboxylic group e.g. alanine, glycine. (b) Acidic amino acids: The acidic amino acids have an extra carboxylic group e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid. (c) Basic amino acids : The basic amino acids have an additional amino group e.g. lysine, arginine (d) Structure of glycine, alanine and serine: Glycine: "

The model proposed that: (i) Each DNA molecule consists of two helical polynucleotide chains or strands. (ii) The strands run anti-parallel i.e., their 3‚Äô-5‚Äô phosphodiester bonds are in opposite direction and the 3‚Äô end of one strand lies besides the 5‚Äô end of the other. (iii) In each polynucleotide chain, the phosphate molecules lie on the outer side of deoxyribose and the nitrogenous bases inward, perpendicular to the helical axis.  (iv) The nitrogenous bases of two strands are linked through hydrogen bonds. Base paring is specific. (Adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine) (v) There are two hydrogen bonds between A = T and three between G = C. ùëú (vi) Length of H - bond is 3 . Two strands are therefore complementary. ùëú (vii) One turn of helix is about 34 and contains 10 nucleotides. ùëú (viii) The distance between the adjacent nucleotide is34 . ùëú (ix) The diameter of helix is about 20 .

(ix) Pectins are commercial jelly agents."
Briefly describe various kinds of lipids.,"Following are the different types of lipids: (i) Simple lipids: These are esters of fatty acid with glycerol. They are of two types. (a) Neutral or true fats : These are esters of fatty acid with glycerol. They are also called glycerol. A fat molecule consists of one molecule of glycerol and one to three molecules of the same or different long-chain fatty acids.  ÔÇ∑ ÔÇ∑  Glycerol has 3 carbons, each bearing a hydroxyl (-OH) group. A fatty acid molecule is an unbranched chain of carbon atoms having a carboxylic group attached to an R group. The R group could be a methyl (-CH3) or ethyl (-C2H5 ) or higher number of -CH2 groups (C to 19-C). e.g. Palmitic acid has 16-C. Fatty acids are of two types:  ÔÇ∑ ÔÇ∑  Saturated fatty acids : These are fatty acids without double bond., e.g. Palmitic acid. Unsaturated fatty acids : These are fatty acids with one or more double bonds., e.g., oleic acids.  Neutral fats may be monoglycerides if there is only one molecule of fatty acid attached to a glycerol molecule. If the number of fatty acids attached is two then it is a diglyceride or triglyceride if it is three. (b) Waxes : These are esters of fatty acids with alcohol of high molecular weight instead of glycerol, e.g., bee wax, lanolin etc. (ii) Compound lipids : These are esters of fatty acids with alcohol, but contain same other substances also. e.g., phospholipids, glycolipids. (iii) Derived lipids such as steroids, prostaglandins etc."
Explain briefly the structural levels of proteins. Describe primary and secondary structures of proteins.    ,"Proteins are macromolecules having one or more polypeptide chains of amino acids. These are highly organised linear polymers of amino acids. Proteins have four structural levels - primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary.  (i) Primary structure : The linear sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is the primary structure of protein. The first amino acid is called N-terminus and last amino acid is called C-terminus. (ii) Secondary structure : The polypeptide chains are coiled or folded in the form of helix. The structure is maintained by a series of regularly spaced intra or inter molecular hydrogen bonds formed between the amino acids of the same or different polypeptide chains. Such a conformation is termed as secondary structure. There are 3 types of secondary structure, Œ±helix, Œ≤-pleated and collagen helix. (iii) Tertiary structure : The helical polypeptide molecules further coiled to assume a complex but specific form is called tertiary structure. They are so arranged as to hide nonpolar amino acid inside and expose the polar side chains. These structure are maintained by several types of bonds such as hydrogen bonds, vander Waal interaction, ionic bonds, disulphide bonds etc., between the polypeptide chains. (iv) Quaternary structure: Each polypeptide develops its own tertiary structure and functions as subunit of the protein. The different charged subunits pack together to give specific conformation. Large proteins such as haemoglobin have quaternary structure. It has four chains, two ùëé-chains and two ùõΩ-chains."

Illustrate lock and key hypothesis of enzyme action.   ,"Mechanism of Enzyme Action: (i) The working of enzymes is a complex one. (ii) All enzymes first of all combine with the respective substrates before yielding the products of the reactions they catalyze. (iii) In other words, enzymes with substrates form an intermediate complex before decomposition of the substrate can occur. (iv) In order to explain the mode of action of enzyme Fischer proposed a Lock and Key theory According to him, if the right key fits in the right lock, the lock can be opened, otherwise not. (v) It is believed that molecules have specific geometric shapes. Proteins are able to act as enzyme primarily because their shape provides surface configurations into which other molecules can fit.  (vi) The molecules which are acted upon by the enzymes are called substrates of the enzymes.  (vii) Under the above assumption only those substrate molecules with the proper geometric shape can fit into the active site of the enzymes. (viii) However, under special circumstances some other molecules which are similar to the substrate can also combine with the active site of an enzyme. (ix) If this happens, the above molecules may compete with the substrate and the reaction may either slow down or stop. (x) Such substances are called as the competitive inhibitors as they act to prevent the production of a substance.  "
