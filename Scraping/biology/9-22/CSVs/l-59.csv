0,Q. 2. What are the general functions of blood ?,"Ans. The general functions of blood are : (i) Transport of Food Materials: Blood transports the digested food from the alimentary canal to the different body cells. (ii) Transport of Respiratory Gases: Oxygen is carried from the respiratory organs to the tissues and carbon dioxide from the tissue to the respiratory organs by blood. (iii) Transport of Hormones : Hormones are carried by blood from the endocrine glands to the places of use. (iv) Transport of Excretory Matter : Blood transports the excretory matter to the kidneys or other excretory organs. (v) Transport of Heat and temperature regulation : Blood allows the transfer of heat from the deeper tissue to surface of the body where it can be lost and this help in temperature regulation. (vi) Defence against infection : Some white blood corpuscles are phagocytic in action, however certain white blood corpuscles produce antitoxins to neutralize the toxins released by the foreign germs.

1,Q. 3. Where does cardiac impulse originate ? How is it conducted to the rest of the chambers ?,"Ans. Conducting system of Human heart: (i) Human heart acts as a pumping station. The heart beat is initiated by the Sino-atrial node (SAN) which lies near the opening of the superior vena cava.  (ii) The SAN acts as a pacemaker. When it is warmed or cooled the frequency of the heart beat is increased or decreased respectively. (iii) The excitation originated at the SA is picked up by another specialized muscle fibres, the AV node in the auricular septum. (iv) From the AV node the excitation travels through the special muscle fibres present in the septum dividing in the two ventricles. (v) This conducting bundle divides into two-right and left bundle. Each branch enters the ventricles through a fine network of the Purkinje fibres. (vi) All the conducting fibres are very specialized type of muscle fibres."
2,Q. 4. Describe the structure of human heart.,"Ans. (i) The heart is composed of two types of chambers. The upper two, small, thin walled chamber are the auricles or atria and receives blood from various parts of the body and lower two large, thick walled muscular ventricles that supply blood to various body organs. (ii) The two auricles are separated by inter-auricular septum. (iii) The right atrium receives the openings of superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and coronary sinus. (iv) The opening of inferior vena cava is guarded by eustachian valve. (v) The opening of the coronary sinus has Thebasian valve. (vi) The left auriculo-ventricular valve consists of two flaps and is termed bicuspid or mitral valve. (vii) The right auriculo-ventricular valve consists of three triangular flaps and is called tricuspid valve. (ix) The right and left ventricles are separated by interventricular septum. (x) The ventricles function as pumping chambers, thus they have thick muscles walls. (xi) Attached to the flaps of the bicuspid and tricuspid valves are special fibrous cords, the chordae tendineae, which are joined to the other ends with the special muscles of the ventricular wall, the papillary muscles. (x) The openings of the right and the left ventricles into the pulmonary atery and the aorla respectively are provided with the semilunar valves."
3,Q. 5. Explain the working mechanism of heart.,"Ans. (i) The heart collects blood through both atria and then distributes it through ventricles. (ii) The action of heart includes contractions and relaxations of atria and ventricles respectively called as systole and diastole.  (iii) The right atrium receives.de-oxygenated blood from different parts of body and from the heart itself through the openings-superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and coronary sinus respectively. (iv) The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs through the openings of the pulmonary veins. (v) The deoxygenated and oxygenated bloods are forced into their respective ventricles. (vi) The contraction of atria is initiated and activated by SA node which spreads the wave of contraction through AV node which are latter transmitted to all parts of ventricles via bundle of His and Purkinje's fibres. (vii) During the contraction of ventricles the backward flow of blood into the atria is prevented by bicuspid and tricuspid valves. (viii) Thus, blood from the left ventricle and right ventricle is forced into the aorta and pulmonary trunk respectively. (ix) In this way the oxygenated blood is supplied to the various parts of the body including the heart itself.  "
