Name and explain the three stages of cell cycle associated with interphase.  Describe the phases of cell cycle with suitable diagram.    Explain the events occurring during the cell cycle of a somatic cell. ,"Cell cycle : The three stages of cell cycle are :(i) G 1 phase, (ii) G2 phase, (ii) s phase or synthesis phase and (iii) G2 phase. The resting stage or stage between two mitotic divisions (that is at the end of prophase and beginning of prophase) is called interphase. The interphase is the longest part of mitotic cycle taking a long time for its completion. It itself consists of three phases: (i) G1 Phase : (Post-Mitotic Gap 1) (a) It includes synthesis and organization of the substrate and enzyme necessary for DNA synthesis. (b) It is marked by the transcription of r-RNA, t-RNA, m-RNA and synthesis of different protein. (c) Enlargement of nucleus. (d) Pooling of nucleotide and protein from the neighbouring cell into dividing cell. (e) The chromosomes lie in the form of more or less loosely coiled thread. (ii) S-Phase (Synthetic phase): (a) The chromosome replicate and the DNA content doubles. Each chromosome comes to have two chromatin thread. (iii) G2 Phase (Pre-Mitotic Gap 2): (a) It is the stage when rate and amount of protein synthesis is maximum. (b) It is the post DNA synthesis phase during which all the metabolic activities concerning growth of cytoplasm and its constituent cell organelle and macro-molecules are formed. (c) Highly extended coiling of chromosome marks starting of prophase. "
Enumerate the events that occur in mitosis of cell division with diagram.,"Mitosis is divided into the following four stages: (i) Prophase: (a) Chromatin material shortens and condenses into thread like structures called chromosomes. (b) Each chromosome consists of two chromatids joined at a point called centromere. (c) At the end of the prophase, the nucleolus and nuclear membrane disappear. The cellular protein content condenses into a spindle.  (ii) Metaphase: (a) A bipolar, anastral spindle develops in the cell (b) The chromosomes appear short and thick., each having two chromatids.  (c) The chromatids become clear and get attached to the poles by spindle fibres at their centromeres. (d) Chromosomes become arranged at the equator of the spindle. (iii) Anaphase: (a) The centromeres split into two and the fibres pull the daughter centromeres to the opposite poles. (b) The daughter chromosomes (with separated chromatids) appear V, J, L and I shaped depending upon the position of centromere. (iv) Telophase: (a) The chromosomes reach the poles of the cell, uncoil, lengthen and lose the ability to be seen clearly. (b) The spindle fibres disintegrate. (c) Nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear and two daughter nuclei appear at opposite poles (v) Karyokinesis is followed by cytokinesis where the following events takes place: (a) Cell plate formation takes place between the two daughter nuclei. (b) Two daughter cells are formed. "
(i) Write a note on significance of meiosis. (ii) Differentiate between anaphase I of meiosis and Anaphase of mitosis. (iii) What do you understand by Synapsis? In which stage of Prophase-I you observe it. ,"(i) Formation of gametes, Genetic variability Maintenance of chromosomal number (ii) Anaphase of mitosis Centromeres and chromatids separate; chromatids moves to opposite poles due to shortening of spindle fibres. Anaphase I of meiosis: Homologous chromosomes separate while chromatids remain associated at their centromeres. (iii) Pairing of homologous chomosomes is synapsis. It is observed during zygotene stage."
How many types of meiosis are there ? Explain.,"Depending upon the stage, when meiosis occurs, the meiosis is of three types : Gametic, zygotic and sporic. (i) Gametic or terminal meiosis : In most animals and some lower plants, meiosis takes place during the formation of gametes (gametogenesis). Such a meiosis is described as gametic or terminal meiosis. When two gametes fuse in fertilization, the diploid zygote is formed. Gametic meiosis results in diplontic life cycle. (ii) Zygotic or initial meiosis: In some lower plants meiosis takes place in the zygote and the resulting organisms are haploid. It is called zygotic or initial meiosis. Organisms having zygotic meiosis have haplontic life cycle. (iii) Sporic or intermediate meiosis: In most of the plants, meiosis occurs at the time of sporogenesis. It is called sporic or intermediate meiosis. Spore gives rise to a new gametophytic phase in the life cycle. The gametophyte produces gametes. The life of plant is said to be diplo-haplontic because of the presence of diploid and haploid multicellular phases."
Describe briefly the two phases of meiotic division.   ,"Two phases of meiotic division: (i) Meiotic cell division is divided into two phasesMeiosis I and Meiosis II. (ii) In the meiotic I division, the homologous chromosomes pair to form bivalents. Exchange of genetic material takes place. (iii) The chromosomes now separate and get distributed into daughter cells. (iv) Prophase I is divided into five sub-stages : Leptotene, Zygotene, Pachytene, Diplotene and Diakinesis. (v) During Metaphase I, the bivalents get arranged on equatorial plate with their arms on the plate but the centromere is directed towards opposite pole. It is followed by Anaphase I.  (vi) Now the homologous chromosomes repel each other, and move to the opposite poles with both their chromatids. (vii) In this way each pole gets half the chromosomes number of the parent cell. (viii) In telophase I, the nuclear envelope and nucleolus again appear. Meiosis II is quite similar to mitosis. (ix) The centromere of each chromosome breaks, separating the chromatids, one each to a daughter cell.  (x) The meiotic cell division maintains the chromosome number of a species. (xi) As a result of meiotic division, the four daughter cells are formed with half the chromosome number (haploid) in each cell."
What is the significance of meiosis?,Significance of Meiosis: (i) Formation of gametes: Meiosis produces gametes that are essential for sexual reproduction. (ii) Maintenance of chromosome number: Meiosis maintains the chromosome number constant in sexually reproducing organisms. It is essential since the chromosome number is doubled after fertilization. (iii) Introduction of variation: Meiosis introduces variation in the organisms due to crossing over and random distribution of paternal and maternal chromosomes. (iv) Mutations: Chromosomal and genomatic: mutations can take place by irregularities of meiotic divisions. Some of the mutations may be advantageous to the organism and are perpetuated by natural selection. (v) Genetic information: It switches on genetic information for the development of gametes or gametophyte and switches off the sporophytic information. (vi) Evidence of basic relationship of organisms: Details of meiosis are essentially similar in the majority of organisms showing their basic similarities and relationship
Describe the sub-phases of prophase I of meiosis I    Describe prophase-I in detail with diagrams.   ,"Prophase I of meiosis I : It is more complicated and prolonged as compared to the similar stag of mitosis. It may be divided into the five sub- phases (i) Leptotene or leptonema: (a) It is the first stage of meiotic division following the interphase. (b) The chromatin fibres of interphase nucleus gets shorten and elongated, chromosomes become clear. (ii) Zygotene or zygonema: (a) The homologous chromosomes come to lie side by side and get attached laterally due to the development of nucleoprotein between them. This pairing of homologous chromosomes is called synapsis or syndesis. (d) On account of synapsis, chromosomes form pairs or bivalent. The number of bivalents is half number of the chromosomes. (iii) Pachytene or pachynema: (a) The paired chromosomes or bivalent become short and thick. The chromatids of each paired chromosome slightly separate and become visible. Thus, each bivalent or chromosome pair is made up of actually four chromatids, two of each chromosome. (b) Each group of four chromatids, is referred as tetrad. During pachytene, exchange of the corresponding segments of non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes, occurs. This process is called crossing over. (c) After crossing over, the two chromatids of a chromosome become dissimilar.  (iv) Diplotene or Diplonema : (a) The nucleoprotein fusion complex of the synapsed chromosomes dissolves. (b) The homologous chromosomes tart separating except in the region of crossing over. (c) The points of attachment between the homologous chromosomes are called chiasmata. (v) Diakinesis: (a) This is marked by terminalisation of chiasmata. During this phase the chromosomes are fully condensed and the meiotic spindle is assembled to prepare the homologous chromosomes for separation. The nucleolus/ nucleoli disappear and Nuclear envelope breaks down into vesicles. "
Explain meiosis II in an animal cell.,"Meiosis II happen in the two haploid nuclei simultaneously. (i) Prophase II: It takes short time. Spindle formation begins and the chromosomes become short. Two chromatids are joined to a single centromere. Nuclear membrane and nucleolus disintegrate. (ii) Metaphase II : At the equator, the chromosomes lie and spindle is formed. The centromere of every chromosome is joined to the spindle fibre. Then centromere also divides. (iii) Anaphase II : The daughter chromosomes are formed. Chromatids move towards their poles with the spindle fibres.  (iv) Telophase II: Reaching at the poles chromosomes form nuclei which are haploid (N) daughter nuclei. Again nuclear membrane is constructed. Nucleolus is clearly visible.  Cytokinesis: The cytokinesis occurs and four daughter cells are formed which are haploid (N). It may occur once or twice (i.e., in Meiosis I and Meiosis or only after the meiosis â…¡ cell division).  "
