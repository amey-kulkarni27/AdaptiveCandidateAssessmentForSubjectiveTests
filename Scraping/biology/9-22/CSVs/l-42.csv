Explain the histology of human gut.,The alimentary canal consists of four basic layers. From the outer surface inward to the lumen (cavity) the layers are as follows: (i) Serosa: (a) It is the outer most layer made up of a thin mesothelium with some connective tissues. (ii) Muscularis: (a) It is composed of outer longitudinal and inner circular muscle fibres. (b) In the stomach an additional layer of oblique muscle fibres is found inner to the circular muscle fibres. (iii) Submucosa: It consists of loose connective tissue richly supplied with blood and lymphatic vessels and in some areas with glands. (iv) Mucosa: It is named so because it secretes mucus to lubricate the inner lining of the gut. 
Explain the types and functions of glands associated with alimentary canal.,"Glands associated with alimentary canal are: (1) Salivary glands: A salivary gland may be defined as any cell or organ which discharges a secretion into the oral cavity. Human salivary glands are classified into two categories: major salivary glands and minor salivary glands. (a) Major Salivary glands: In man the major salivary glands are three pairs: parotid, sublingual and submandibular glands. (i) Parotid glands: These are the largest salivary glands which are situated near the ears. Their ducts open into the oral cavity near the upper second molars. The duct of parotid gland is called Stenson’s duct.  (ii) Sublingual glands: These are small-sized salivary glands which are located beneath the tongue and their ducts are called sublingual ducts or ducts of Rivinus. (iii) Submandibular glands: These are medium sized salivary glands which are located at the angles of the lower jaw. Their ducts open into the oral cavity near the lower central incisors. The duct of submandibular gland is called Wharton's duct. The parotid salivary glands secrete much of salivary amylase. (b) Minor salivary glands: There are numerous small glands situated in the mucous membrane of the lips (libial glands), Cheeks (buccal glands), tongue lingual glands) and palate (palatine glands). The secretions of these glands help to keep the mouth moist and provide a protective and lubricant coat of mucus. The fluids secreted by major and minor salivary glands constitute saliva. (2) Gastric glands: These are numerous microscopic, tubular glands formed by the epithelium of the stomach. The following types of cells are present in the epithelium of the gastric glands. (i) Peptic cells: (= chief or Zymogenic or Zymogen cells). They are usually basal in location and secrete gastric digestive enzymes as proenzymes or zymogens; pepsinogen and prorennin. (ii) Oxyntic cells: They are large and are most numerous on the side walls of the gastric glands They secrete hydrochloric acid and Castle’s intrinsic factor. (iii) Mucous cells: They are present between other types of cells and secrete mucus. (3) Liver: It is the largest gland of the body which secrete heparin (anticoagulant). It also produces bile. (4) Pancreas: It is a soft lobulated pinkish gland which secretes two major hormones: (i) Insulin, (ii) Glucagon. (5) Intestinal gland: These are formed by the surface epithelium of small intestine. These are of two types: (i) Crypts of Lieberkuhn which secrete mucus and digestive enzymes. (ii) Brunner's gland found in duodenum which secretes mucus."
"Differentiate between duodenum, jejunum and ileum.","(i) Coagulation of milk in the alimentary canal: (a) When the food or milk reaches stomach, the protein digestion starts. (b) Pepsin stimulates the digestion of proteins in milk (casein). HCl activates pepsinogen into pepsin. (c) It hydrolyses soluble casein into paracasein which gets precipitated as calcium paracaseinate to make solid curd i.e., coagulation of milk. (d) There is a milk-coagulating enzyme called rennin which is found in calf gastric juice.  (e) Rennin is secreted as pro-rennin (inactive state) but in presence of HCl it is hydrolysed into active rennin. (f) Rennin hydrolyses casein into paracasein leading to milk coagulation. (ii) Digestion of starch in the alimentary canal: (a) In man and most of the other mammals, digestion starts in mouth or buccal cavity. (b) There are three pairs of salivary glands present in the mouth. These glands secrete a alkaline fluid called saliva. (c) The crushed food is mixed with saliva and is converted into a pulpy mass called bolus. (d) Saliva contains enzyme ptyalin (salivary amylase) which acts on cooked starches (polysaccharides) changing them to the disaccharide maltose. (e) Optimum pH for this reaction is 6.8. As soon as the food reaches the stomach, the ptyalin stops because of the acidic, reaction of gastric juice, pH 1.5 to 1.8. The stomach contents entering the duodenum are now called as chyme. (f) When acid chyme passes into the small intestine it is mixed first with the pancreatic juice and bile and then with the intestinal juice. (g) Pancreatic juice contains enzyme amylase which converts all digestible polysaccharides (starches) not affected by ptyalin to disaccharides (sugars). (h) Intestinal juice also contains amylase, sucrase, maltase and lactase. (i) These enzymes convert disaccharide into monosaccharides and hence digestion starch is completed."
Mention the pathways for absorption.,"There are two pathways for absorption i.e., (i) Water, mineral salts, water soluble vitamins, monosaccharides and amino acids are carried to the liver by the hepatic portal system. From the liver, these materials finally enter the blood stream. (ii) Fatty acids, glycerol, steroids and fats soluble vitamins are absorbed by lymphatic system and then carried into the blood stream. Chyle  (iii) Amino acids and simple sugars  → "
Q. 10.. Write about some disorders of digestive system.,"Digestion is a process in which complex food materials are broken down by enzymes into simpler substances, which can be easily assimilated by the body. The pancreatic duct and bile duct open into the duodenum of the Here the food gets mixed by bile juice and pancreatic juice. Bile juice does not contain any enzyme. However, it plays an important part in digestion as it provides an alkaline medium to food and helps in emulsification of fat. The pancreatic juice contains the following enzymes, which act upon different kinds of food stuffs. (i) Trypsin, which acts on proteins and changes them to peptones. (ii) Pancreatic amylase, which acts on carbohydrates and changes them to maltose or to other complex sugars. (iii) Lipase, which acts on fats and changes them to soluble fatty acids and glycerol. The intestinal glands secrete enzymes like, (a) Erepsin, which helps to convert peptides into amino acids. (b) Maltase, which changes maltose to glucose. (c) Lactase, which changes lactose into glucose and galactose. (d) Sucrase, which changes sucrose into glucose and fructose. In this way, the digestion of food is completed in the small intestine.
