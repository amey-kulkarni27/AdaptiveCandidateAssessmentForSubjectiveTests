What is osteoporosis? Name two factors which are responsible for osteoporosis. ,"Osteoporosis: It is age-dependent systemic disorder. Its main symptoms include (1) microarchitectural disintegration, (2) Susceptibility to fractures. Factors responsible for osteoporosis: (i) Deficiency of calcium and calciferol (vit. D). (ii) Imbalances of hormones like sex hormones, steroid hormones as well as thyrocalcitonin."
Describe the three disorders of the muscular and skeletal system.,"The three disorders are: (i) Myasthenia gravis: It is an autoimmune disorder affecting neuromuscular junction leading to fatigue, weakening and paralysis of skeletal muscle. (ii) Tetany: Rapid spasms (wild contractions) in muscle due to lesser Ca ++ in body fluid is tetany. (iii) Muscular dystrophy: It is an inborn abnormality associated with progressive degeneration of skeletal muscle."
What is a joint? Briefly describe the types of joints. ,"The structural arrangements of tissues by which bones are joined together are called joints. There are three types of joints: (i) Fibrous or immovable joints: There is no movement in such joints. There is white fibrous tissue between the ends of the bones. e.g., the joints of skull, teeth etc. (ii) Cartilaginous or slightly movable joints: It is an articulation between bones in which motion is limited due to either fibrous tissue or cartilage. (iii) Synovial or freely movable joints: It is a freely movable joint characterized by the presence of a fluid filled synovial cavity between the articulating surfaces of the two bone."
What is muscle fatigue? How does it cause?,"The reduction in the force of contraction of a muscle after prolonged stimulation is called muscle fatigue. (i) A muscle is able to contract for a short time in the absence of oxygen. But it gets fatigue sooner because the metabolic products of glycolysis mainly lactic acid accumulate, in the absence of oxygen. (ii) The accumulation of lactic acid leads to muscle fatigue."
Describe the structure of synovial joint.,"(i) There is a membrane present called synovial membrane. (ii) This membrane is composed of secretory epithelial cells which secrete a thick sticky fluid, of the consistency of the white of an egg called synovial fluid. (iii) It acts as a lubricant to the joint, provides nutrient materials for the structures within the joint cavity and helps to maintain the stability of the joint.  (iv) Bone ends are covered by articular cartilages. (v) Ligaments join the bones and tendons connect the bones with muscles. (vi) Little sacs of synovial fluid or bursae are found in some joints.  "
