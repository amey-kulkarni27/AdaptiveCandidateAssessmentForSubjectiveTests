Why aldosterone is called as salt retaining hormone?,"(i) Aldosterone (salt-retaining hormone) is the principal mineralocorticoid in humans. Its main function is to regulate the sodium content of the body. It is secreted when the sodium level is low. (ii) It acts on the kidneys to cause more sodium to be returned to the blood and more potassium to be excreted. (iii) As the sodium concentration in the blood increases, water follows it by osmosis, so the blood volume also increases. Thus, the effect of aldosterone is to increase both sodium and water in the blood."
How control of insulin and glucagon is regulated by push and pull mechanism ?,"(i) It is regulated by a ‘limit-control feedback’ or ‘push and pull feedback' mechanism. (ii) When sugar level in blood increases, insulin is secreted and glucagon secretion is inhibited. (iii) When blood-sugar level falls, for instance during excessive physical labour or stress, secretion of glucogen is stimulated and insulin secretion is inhibited. (iv) This is the self-regulating device."
How is communication among parts of an organism accomplished?,"(i) Hormones, a chemical messenger is transported by blood, they reach target organs, i.e., organs for which they are intended. (ii) Hormones may stimulate or inhibit specific biological processes in target organs to modify their activities. Thus they regulate organs and tissues. (iii) The activity of these messenger molecules, i.e., hormones secreted in the blood by endocrine glands is under the direct control of the nervous system.  "
