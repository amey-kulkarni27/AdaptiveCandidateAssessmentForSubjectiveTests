Alcohol is directly absorbed from the stomach by the blood capillaries. The alcohol is known to cause damage to the liver cells. Liver cells produce bile juice. If the liver cells are damaged they would not be able to produce bile. If the bile is not produced in required quantities, the emulsification and further digestion of fats is not possible. This would bring about disturbances in the digestion and adsorption of fats. The alcohol also hardens the stomach wall, which would reduce the churning of food in the stomach.  "
