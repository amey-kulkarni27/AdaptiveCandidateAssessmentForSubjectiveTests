Stomach is the right place where hydrochloric acid is required to be secreted in the gastric juice. Describe any three points to justify this statement.,Absorption of fat: (i) Digested fat is absorbed in the small intestine. (ii) Fatty acids and glycerol being insoluble cannot be absorbed into the blood. (iii) They are first incorporated into small droplets called micells which move into the intestinal mucosa. (iv) They are reformed into small coated fat globules called chylomicrons
"Write notes on: (1) ulcers, and (2) constipation.","(i) Pepsinogen: Pepsinogen becomes activated as soon as the food reaches the stomach i.e., as soon as the secretion of HCI takes place. It acts most effectively within the pH range of 1.6-3.2. (ii) PrCarboxypeptidase: Trypsin activates carboxy-peptidase. (iii) Rennin: It is secreted as prorennin but HCl present in the gastric juice converts inactive prorennin into active rennin. (iv) Trypsinogen and Chymotrypsinogen: These are inactive enzymes until they come in contact with enteropeptidase(intestinal enzyme) which converts them into active trypsin and chymotrypsin."

You have eaten boiled rice for lunch. Make a list of enzymes that will act upon the rice and the changes it will undergo before being absorbed in the small intestine.,The protein hydrolyzing enzymes are known as proteases. These proteases are secreted in inactive form and are called proenzymes. If these are secreted in active form these proenzymes would hydrolyze cellular and extra cellular proteins of the individual itself. Pepsin and rennin are secreted in inactive forms - pepsinogen and prorennin. These are activated at the sites of their action in stomach by optimal pH or by specific proteases.
