0,Q. 1. Define essential elements. Give the criteria for knowing the essentiality of an element. Give some essential elements. ,"Ans. Biological nitrogen fixation is the process in which certain living organisms convert the free nitrogen into those compounds which can be used by plants. (i) The organisms may be free-living bacteria (e.g., 𝐴𝑧𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟), symbiotic bacteria like 𝑅ℎ𝑖𝑧𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑢𝑚 or Cyanobacteria. (ii) The enzyme involved in the process is nitrogenase, which is a Mo-Fe protein. (iii) During this process, the atmospheric nitrogen is reduced by the addition of hydrogen. (iv) The three bonds between the two nitrogen atoms (N ≡ N) are broken and hydrogen is progressively added to form ammonia. (v) This fixation requires three components: (a) ATP, to supply energy. (b) A strong reducing agent, to transfer hydrogen atoms. (c) The enzyme system (nitrogenase) (vi) The overall reaction is as follows : N2 + 8e- + 8H+ + 16 ATP-→ 2NH3 + H2 + 16 ADP +16 Pi  Q.  9. Distinguish between the following: Micronutrients and Macronutrients. Ans S. No. (i) (ii)  (iii)  Micronutrients Micronutrients form minor portion of dry weight of a plant. They are required in minute quantities i.e., less than 10 m mole/kg of dry matter Most of them act as activators for enzymes, e.g., Manganese, Zinc, Boron etc.  (iv) These are called trace elements. (Any three)  Macronutrients Macronutrients form major portion of dry weight of a plant. They are required in relatively large quantities i.e., in excess of 10 mmole kg-1 of dry matter They enter into the structure of macromolecules of the cell, e.g., Carbon, Hydrogen and Nitrogen etc. These are called major elements.
