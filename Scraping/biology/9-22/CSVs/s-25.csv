questions,answers
(i) Draw the labelled diagram of a nephron. (ii) What is the role of Henle’s loop?,(i)  (ii) Loop of Henle plays a significant role in the maintenance of high osmolality of medullary interstitial fluid.
What are nephrons? Describe the types of nephrons.,"Nephrons are the structural and functional units of the kidneys. On the basis of location, the nephrons are of two types: (i) Juxta-medullary nephron: Their glomeruli are found in the inner margins of the cortex. The loop of Henle lie deep into the medulla. They are associated with vasa recta. They control plasma volume when water supply is short. (ii) Cortical nephrons: They mainly lie in the renal cortex. Their glomeruli are found in the outer cortex. The loops of Henle are short and extend to short distance of medulla. They do not have vasa recta."
What are the functions performed by kidneys?,Kidneys perform following functions: (i) It removes metabolic waste products. (ii) It regulates the water content of body fluids. (iii) It regulates pH of body fluids.  (iv) It regulates the chemical composition of body fluids by removal of substances which are in excess of immediate requirements.
Describe glomerular filtration in human nephrons.,"The glomerular capillaries are narrower than the afferent renal arterioles, therefore the blood pressure in the glomerular capillaries becomes very high and there is continuous process of ultrafiltration through the semi-permeable glomerular capillaries. Filtration of blood occurs through three layers: (i) The endothelium of glomerular blood vessels. (ii) The epithelium of Bowman's capsule and (iii) The basement membrane between the two layers. The epithelial cells of Bowman's capsule called podocytes are arranged intricately so as to leave minute spaces called filtration slits. The glomerular filtrate and blood plasma are similar except that glomerular filtrate does not have proteins and fats."
State the various parts of a nephron. Give functions of each part of nephron.,"Table showing functions of different parts of a nephron in the formation of urine in mammals. S. No.  Parts of Nephron  Functions  (i)  Glomerulus  Glomerular  (ii)  Proximal convoluted tubule  (iii)  Henle’s Loop (a) Descending limb (b) Ascending limb  (iv)  Distal tubule and collecting tubules  Selective reabsorption by active transport and Reabsorption by diffusion. Reabsorption Diffusion Osmosis and Diffusion Reabsorption (active transport)  Substances removed Water, urea, uric acid, amino acids glucose, and creatinine. Reabsorption of glucose amino acids, sodium, potassium, chlorides, water, etc. NaCl H2O Urea, K+ Na+ and ClSodium ions  Secretion by DCT  K+ ions  Active Transport  K+, H+, Uric acid, NH3, etc.  Tubular secretion by active transport  Pigments and drugs.

Distinguish between: Nephridia and Nephron.,"S. No. (i)  (ii)  Nephridia These are delicate, small coiled, complicated tubes performing excretion and are found in earth worm. They collect the waste from the body and pass them outside the animal through small openings.  Nephron It is the functional unit of kidney in vertebrates.  It is highly convoluted, delicate tubular structure. Made up cup shaped body called Bowman’s capsule. A tuft of capillaries lies in the Bowman’s capsule. The remaining part is divided into a coiled proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle and a distal convoluted tubule. "
How is glomerular filtrate hypertonic and hypotonic in descending and ascending limb of loop of Henle respectively? What is the effect of ADH on collecting tubules?,"Counter current system is found in two limbs of loop of Henle. The ascending limb transports Na+ and some urea into surrounding medullary tissue. It is impermeable to water. So it makes urine dilute or hypotonic. The walls of descending limbs are permeable of water and salt, so Na+ and water from surrounding fluid are absorbed. Thus the contents of urine become hypertonic. ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone): ADH is secreted when the osmotic pressure of blood increases due to excess loss of water from the body. The hormone renders the walls of distal convoluted tubule, collecting tubule (CT) and collecting duct of a nephron permeable to water and increases the reabsorption of water into the surrounding tissues and particular capillaries. The urine becomes hyperosmotic and less in volume and water is conserved in the body.  "
