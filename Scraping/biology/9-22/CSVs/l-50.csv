Demonstrate an experiment to show osmosis.,"The mouth of a thistle funnel is tied with a semipermeable membrane. The thistle funnel filled with sugar solution is then dipped in a beaker containing water. Water will move into the funnel resulting in rise in the level of the solution. This will continue till the equilibrium is reached. If pressure is applied to the solution from the upper part of the funnel, no water diffuses into the funnel through the membrane. "
"What is the term used for long distance movement of carbohydrates in plants ? How and in what form do the carbohydrates synthesized in the leaves, reach long distance parts in a plant? ","The food material synthesized in the leaves is translocated to the different regions of the plants through the phloem either by cytoplasmic streaming hypothesis or by mass flow hypothesis. (i) According to mass flow hypothesis proposed by Munch (1926), the translocation of food takes place from leaves to the storage organs of the plant. (ii) The food in the form of glucose is prepared by leaves by the process of photosynthesis. (iii) It increases the osmotic potential. As a result, the water from the xylem cells enters into the leaf cells by increasing turgor pressure. (iv) At the other end or in fruits and seeds, there is a low concentration of sugar which results in a low turgor and osmotic pressure. This difference in the pressure occurs on the two extreme sides i.e., on one side there are leaves and on the other side there are other organs of the plant. "
"What are the advantages and disadvantages of transpiration? ""Transpiration is a necessary evil"". Justify the statement.","Advantages of Transpiration: (i) Ascent of sap: Ascent of sap mostly occurs due to pull exerted by transpiration of water. (ii) Removal of excess water : It has been held that plants absorb far more amount of water than is actually required by them. Transpiration, therefore, removes the excess of water. (iii) Cooling effect : Radiant heat falling on the plants increases their temperature which may be dangerous to the plants. Transpiration, by evaporating water, lowers down their temperature. (iv) Mechanical tissue : The development of mechanical tissues which is essential for providing rigidity and strength to the plants, is favoured by the increase in transpiration. (v) Increasing Concentration of Mineral Salts : The sap absorbed from the soil contains low concentration of mineral salts. The loss of water through transpiration increases the concentration of mineral salts in the plant.  Disadvantages of Transpiration : (i) Wilting : Wilting or loss of turgidity is quite common during noon due to transpiration being higher than the rate of water absorption. Wilting reduces photosynthesis and other metabolic activities. (ii) Reduced Growth : Transpiration reduces availability of water inside the plant. Water deficit decreases the growth and hence the plant gives a stunted appearance. (iii) Abscissic Acid : Water stress produces abscisic acid. Abscissic acid prevents several plant processes and promotes abscission of leaves, flowers and fruits. (iv) Wastage of Energy : Since 98-99% of absorbed water is lost through transpiration, the energy used in absorption and conduction of water goes waste. (v) Modification : In order to reduce transpiration during critical periods, the plants produce several types of modification like thick cuticle, hair, prickles, spines, thons, sunken stomata, phylloclades, cladodes, etc."
Explain the mechanism of water absorption by plants.,"Plants absorb water by two distinct and independently operating methods : Passive absorption and Active absorption. (i) Passive absorption : (a) In this process, water is absorbed through the roots hairs rather than by the roots. (b) The root cells play a passive role or merely act as physical absorbing system. (c) The force for this type of water absorption originates in the aerial parts of the plant due to transpiration. It creates a tension or low water potential in the mesophyll cells of the leaves. (d) The latter, in turn, draw water from the xylem of the vascular bundle. Thus, water in the xylem is under pull or tension. It is called transpiration pull. (e) Due to the presence of continuous column of water from leaves to roots through xylem channel, the tension is transmitted to the xylem of roots and finally to root hair through endodermis and cortex. (f) Thus, a water potential gradient develops between the root hair cell and the soil solution. This results, movement of water across the root as a continuous stream. (ii) Active absorption : (a) Active absorption takes place by the activity of root itself, particularly root hairs. It utilizes metabolic energy. (b) A root hair cell functions as an osmotic system. Water is absorbed by the root hair due to osmotic differences between soil water and cell sap. (c) There exists a great difference in the osmotic pressure of the two sides or water potential gradient between the soil solution and cell sap. (d) The soil solution having less OP, has higher water potential than the cell sap with more OP. (e) Thus, water moves from the region of higher water potential towards the regions of lower water potential. (f) Water continues to enter the root hair cell as long as the water potential of the root cell sap is more negative than that of the soil solution. Water moves from cell to cell along the water potential gradient and reach up to endodermis and pericycle. (g) Finally water enters into the xylem."
Explain the mechanism of uptake of minerals by the plants.,"Plants absorb minerals as ions. The rate of mineral absorption is independent of its concentration in the soil. It has two phases, the initial phase and the metabolic phase. In  metabolic phase, the ions pass into inner space (cytoplasm and vacuole) by two methods : (a) Passive absorption (b) Active absorption. (i) Passive mineral absorption : (a) It occur by the physical processes like diffusion. Diffusion do not involve any direct expenditure of metabolic energy. (b) There are ion channels in the membrane. (c) There are transmembrane proteins, which function as selective pores for the diffusion of ions. (d) Similarly there are aquaporins for the diffusion of water. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are also transported across the membrane passively. (ii) Active mineral absorption : (a) Active transport occurs through the agency of specific carriers present in the plasma membranes of the absorbing cells. It requires energy, which is supplied by ATP. (b) The enzymes at pores present on the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells use the energy of ATP to pump protons across the membrane. This establishes an electrochemical proton gradient that supplies energy for moving ions into the cells. (c) The cells of endodermis have many transport proteins embedded in their plasma membrane. (d) The active uptake of ions is partly responsible for the water potential gradient in roots, and therefore for the uptake of water by osmosis. (e) Ions diffuse down their concentration gradient from the epidermis to the xylem.  "
