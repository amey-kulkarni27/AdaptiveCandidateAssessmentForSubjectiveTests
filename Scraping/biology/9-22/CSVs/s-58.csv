Describe briefly the experiment conducted by T.W. Engelmann.,Engelmann split light into its spectral components by the prism and then illuminated ùê∂ùëôùëéùëëùëúùëù‚Ñéùëúùëüùëé (a green alga) placed in a suspension of aerobic bacteria. He found that bacteria accumulated in the region of blue and red light of the split spectrum. He thus discovered the effect of different wavelengths of light on photosynthesis and plotted the first action spectrum of photosynthesis.
Why does chlorophyll appear green in reflected light and red in transmitted light ? Explain the significance of these phenomenon in terms of photosynthesis.,"In reflected light, the chlorophyll appears red because of fluorescence. The light absorbed by chlorophyll molecules loses its energy and emits wavelengths corresponds to red colour. In transmitted light, chlorophyll appears green because it absorbs only light of wavelengths correspond to green colour."
Explain the following:    (i) There will be no life without photosynthesis. (ii) There is no oxygen evolution in bacterial photosynthesis. (iii) Chlorophyll a is an essential photosynthetic pigment.,"(i) For existence of life, food and O2 are very essential. Photosynthesis is the only process which can trap solar energy and can synthesis food for own and all other organisms. During photosynthesis, O2 is given out and CO2 is taken. So, it keeps balance of O2 and CO2 in nature. Thus, photosynthesis is essential for existence of life. (ii) In bacterial photosynthesis, the raw material of the supply of proton (H +) is H2 S. than H2 O. Thus, there is production of Sulphur and not oxygen. (iii) Chlorophyll-b and other pigments of a reaction centre or photosystem absorb solar energy and transfer it to chlorophyll-a. Ultimately it is the chlorophylI-a that initiates the photosynthesis process. "
What is difference between cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation ? , (i)  (ii)  (iii)  Cyclic photophosphorylation It is a process of photophosphory- lation in which an electron expelled by the excited photo- centre is returned to it after passing through a series of electron carriers It is performed by photosystem I (PSI) only. It synthesises only ATP.  Non-cyclic photophosphorylation It is a normal process of photo phosphorylation in which the electron expelled by the excited photocentre does not return to it. It is carried out in collaboration of both photosystem I and II. Non-cyclic Photophosphorylation is not only connected with ATP synthesis but also production of NADPH. 
What is non-cyclic photophosphorylation ? Describe the process. Why is the process referred to as non-cyclic ? ,Non-cyclic photophosphorylation is the process in which electrons emitted from P680 molecule does not return to it but another electron comes from photolysis of water. It involves both PS I and PS II.
Certain plants growing in tropical region suffer from photorespiratory loss. How do they overcome it? Mention the anatomical adaptation. Mention the first stable CO2 fixation product and the enzyme responsible for it.  ,"Plants like sugarcane, maize shows C4 pathway for the CO2 fixation during the photosynthesis to oercome the problem of photorespiration which is energy consuming process. These plants have kranz anatomy. In kranz anatomy, the mesophyll is undifferentiated and its cells occur in concentric layers around vascular bundles. Vascular bundles are surrounded by large sized bundle sheath cells. The choloroplast of mesophyll cells are smaller and perform light reaction of photosynthesis and also possess PEPcase for the CO2 fixation. The first stable product of C4 pathway is oxalo-acetic acid. The enzyme responsible for the fixation of atmospheric CO2 is PEP Carboxylase (Phosphoenol Pyruvate Carboxylase)."

What are the various events which are responsible for causing proton gradient across the membrane ?,"The various events that cause the proton gradient across the membrane are: (i) The splitting of water molecule takes place on the inner side of the membrane. The protone (H + ions) that are produced by the splitting of water accumulate within the lumen of thylakoids. (ii) As electrons move through the photosystems, protons are transported across the membrane. This happens because the primary acceptor of electron which is located towards the outer side of the membrane, transfers its electron carrier to a proton (H + ) carrier. (iii) The NADP reductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the membrane. Along with electrons, protons are necessary for the reduction of NADP + to NADPH + H + ."

(iv) On observation it was found that oxygen evolved in photosynthesis was heavy oxygen 18 O2 and not the natural osygen. (v) Now, the bheavy isotope of carbon dioxide ( C14 O2 ) was supplied to the plant. (vi) Thus it showed that in photosynthesis, oxygen is evolved from water molecules and not from carbon dicnide."
Q. 16 Why are ùêÇùüí plants preferred in the tropical region ?   ,"ùêÇùüí plants preferred in tropical region because: (i) They consume 30 ATPs (12 ATPs more than C3 plants) to produce one molecule of glucose favoured im tropical region. (ii) In these plants.photorespiration is the mechanism not to lose the photosynthetic carbon. (iii) In the process of photorespiration, RuBP is catabolised to a 3-carbon atom compound instead of combining with CO2 . (iv) More than 50% CO2 fixed by photosynthesis is lost in photorespiration.

who proposed the hypothesis that all photosynthetic organisms require a source of hydregrn and in plants this source wan water and the oxygen is evolved by splitting of water ? What observation led to propose this hypothesis?,"Van Niel in 1931 proposed the hypothesis that all photosynthetic organisms require a source of hydrogen and in plants this source is water and the oxygen is evolved by the splitting of water. (i) Van Niel observed that green sulphur photosynthetic bacteria fixed carbon dioxide in presence of hydrogen sulphide. (ii) Okygen was not evolved instead globules of sulphur was formed. (iii) From this observation he concluded that during bacterial photosynthesis CO2 does not split, instead hydrogen sulphide splits and acts as a hydrogen donor to CO2 to form carbohydrates and molecular sulphur is released as one of the products. ùëÉùê∏ùëÉ ùëêùëéùë†ùëí  6CO2 + 12H2 S ‚Üí  C6 H12 O6 + 6H2 O + 12S  This observation on photosynthetic bacteria led Van Niel to propose above given hypothesis."
