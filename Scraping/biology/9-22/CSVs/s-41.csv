What is the role of sarcoplasmic reticulum myosin head and F-actin during contraction of striated muscles of hormones. ,(i) Sarcoplasmic reticulum: It releases calcium ions into the sarcoplasm that binds to troponin causing a change in its shape and position and thereby remove the masking of active sites for myosin. (ii) Myosin head: The myosin head is an active ATPase enzyme and has binding sites for ATP and active sites for actin. It binds to the exposed active sites on actin to form a cross bridge. (iii) F-actin: The actin sites on the F-actin are specific to the mysoin head for cross-bridge formation.
Name the following bones:  (i) Smallest Ear Bone (ii) Collar Bone (iii) Knee cap (iv) Thigh bone (v) Upper arm bone (vi) Ist Vertebra,(i) Stapes (iii) Patella (v) Humerus  (ii) Clavicle (iv) Femur (vi) Atlas 
Describe isotonic and isometric contractions.,(i) Isotonic contractions: The force exerted on a muscle by lift and load. The muscle contraction is said to be isotonic (in a constant tension) since the load remains constant throughout the period of shortening of muscle. (ii) Isometric contraction: Shortening is prevented by maintaining the muscle at a fixed length. The development of tension occurs at the constant muscle length. This type of contraction is said to be in isometric contraction (constant length).
How many pairs of ribs are found and what are they called?,"There are 12 pairs of ribs which form the bony lateral walls of the thoracic cage. (i) The first seven pairs are called true ribs because their anterior ends are attached directly to the sternum by means of small pieces of hyaline cartilage, the costal cartilages. (ii) The eighth, ninth and tenth pairs of the ribs are called false ribs. They articulate by cartilage which are attached indirectly to the sternum. They are also called vertebrochondral ribs. (iii) The last two pairs of ribs are called floating ribs because their anterior ends are not attached to either the sternum or the cartilage of another rib. The floating ribs protect the kidneys."
Why movements of internal organs are essential for animals?,"Movement of internal organs are essential for the animals because: (i) Food and urine are moved forward by the movements of the muscles present in the  digestive and urinary tracts respectively. (ii) Movements of cardiac muscles enables the heart to receive and distribute the blood. (iii) Inspiration and expiration involves the movements of the diaphragm, ribs, etc. (iv) Movements of uterine wall enable the mother to give birth to a child."
Mention the function of vertebral column.,Functions of vertebral column: (i) It protects the spinal cord. (ii) It carries the weight of the body during motion as well as in standing position. (iii) Anterior cervical vertebrae allow free movement of the head. (iv) The inter-vertebral discs present in between the vertebral give axial flexibility to the animal.
Describe the structure and functions of sternum.,"Structure of Sternum: (i) This is a flat bone which is present just under the skin in the middle of the front of the chest. (ii) Its shape is like a dagger and consists of three parts: the manubrium is the uppermost part, the body is the middle portion and the xiphoid process is the tip of the bone. (iii) The true ribs (7 pairs) are attached to the sternum. Functions of Sternum: (a) It protects the internal organ in the thoracic region. (b) It also provides the surface for muscle attachment. (c) The sternum helps in the respiratory mechanism."
What are antagonistic muscles? Write about any one set of antagonistic muscles.,"Muscles which act in opposition to other muscles are called the antagonistic muscles. One set of antagonistic muscles is: (i) Flexor: This muscle bends one part of a limb on another at a joint, e.g,, biceps. It bring the fore arm towards the upper arm. (ii) Extension: This muscle extends or straightens a limb e.g., triceps. It extends the fore arm."
How are thick and thin filaments arranged in a muscle fibre?,"(i) The sarcoplasmic reticulum releases the stored Ca ++ which binds with the specific sites present on the troponin component of the thin filament. (ii) As a result, conformational change occurs in the troponin molecule and the active sites present on the F-actin molecules are exposed. (iii) These sites are specific to myosin head which exhibits Mg ++ dependent ATPase activity. (iv) During the relaxation of the muscle, the Ca ++ is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. (v) As a result the troponin component becomes free to mask the active sites for myosin head. (vi) The cross bridge breaks and thin filament occupies its normal position and muscle relaxes.  "
