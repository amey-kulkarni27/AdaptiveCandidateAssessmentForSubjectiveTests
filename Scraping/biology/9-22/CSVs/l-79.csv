0,Q. 1. Describe the urinary system of humans with the help of well labelled diagram.,"Ans. Human urinary system comprises a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary bladder and a urethra. (i) Kidneys: (a) There is pair of kidneys which are dark-red, bean shaped, each with a notch, the hilum on its inner side. (b) Blood vessels, lymph vessels, nerves and ureter enter or leave the kidney through the hilum. (c) They are situated in the anterior part of the abdominal cavity one on either side of the median line. (d) Last two pair of ribs (floating ribs) protect the kidneys. (e) The concave side of each kidney faces inwards and convex side outwards. (f) The right kidney is slightly lower than the left and the left kidney is little nearer to the middle plane than the right. (g) The kidney is metanephric. (ii) Ureters: (a) The ureter of each kidney leaves from the renal pelvis in the hilum region. (b) They are narrow, tubular structures, and open into the urinary bladder. (c) They carry urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. (iii) Urinary bladder: (a) It lies in the pelvic cavity and is pear shaped, muscular, sac-like structure. (b) The muscular layer of the urinary bladder is well developed. The latter consists of three layers of smooth muscle-inner and outer layer of longitudinal fibres and middle layer of circular fibres. (c) Both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems innervate the urinary bladder. (d) The urinary bladder stores urine temporarily. (iv) Urethra: (a) It is a canal like structure which extends from the neck of the bladder and leads to exterior. (b) It opens by urethral orifice infront of vaginal aperture (genital aperture). (c) In male, urethra is much longer which opens out at the tip of the penis by urinogenital aperture. (d) Thus the urethra of male carries both urine and semen. "
1,"Q. 2. Difference between Ammonotelism, Ureotelism and Uricotelism.","Ans. S. Ammonotelism No. (i) Excretory waste is ammonia (NH3). (ii) It is characteristic of aquatic animals such as protozoans, sponges, coelenterates, crustaceans, bony fishes and echinoderms etc. (iii)  Excess of water is required to eliminate ammonia. It is highly toxic.  (iv)  Water loss is about 300-500 ml to remove one gram of ammonia.  (v)  Ammonia is formed in liver cells by the deamination of the amino acids.  Ureotelism  Uricotelism  Excretory waste is urea (NH2-CO-NH2). It is characteristic of mammals, cartilaginous fishes (e.g., dogfish) and amphibians etc.  Excretory waste is uric acid. It is characteristic of terrestrial reptiles and insects. All the birds are uricotelic.  Less water is needed, urea is less toxic than ammonia. It can be retained for some time in body without any harmful effect. Water loss is about 50 ml to eliminate one gram of urea.  Much less water is needed. Uric acid is least toxic.  Urea is formed in liver by detoxification of ammonia.  Water loss is about 10 ml to excrete out one gram of uric acid. Uric acid is formed mainly from the purines in liver cells. In insects, uric acid is formed in malpighian tubules. "
2,"Q. 3. Describe briefly the regulation of kidney function by the following. (i) ADH, (ii) ANE (iii) Renin","Ans. Regulation of Kidney: (i) ADH: Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is secreted by hypothalamus of the brain and released into the blood from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. The release of ADH is triggered when osmo-receptors in the hypothalamus detect an increase in the osmolarity of the blood above a set point of 300 osmo mL-1. In this situation the osmoreceptors cells also promote thirst. It increases the reabsorption of water in the DCT and collecting duct. (ii) ANF: Atrial natriuretic factor is another hormone which opposes the regulation by RAAS. The walls of the artery of the heart release ANF in response to an increase in blood volume and pressure. ANF inhibits release of renin from the JG cells and thereby inhibits NaCl reabsorption by the collecting duct and reduces aldosterone release from the adrenal gland. Thus ADH, RAAS and ANF regulate the function of the kidneys. As a result they control body fluid osmolarity, salt concentration, blood pressure and blood volume. (iii) Renin: The smooth muscle cells of both the afferent and efferent arterioles are swollen and contain dark granules. These cells are called juxtaglomerular cells. A fall in glomerular blood flow or glomerular blood pressure activate the JG cells to release renin. Renin converts angiotensinogen in blood into angiotensin II. The later increases blood pressure. Angiotensin  also stimulates the secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex, thus infusing the reabsorption of sodium ions by the DCT and that of water through collecting ducts."
3,Q. 4. Explain the process of urine formation in human being. ,"Ans. Urine formation includes three processes: (i) Ultrafiltration, (ii) Selective reabsorption, (iii) Selective Secretion. (i) Ultrafiltration: It is filtration which occurs under high blood pressure. The afferent arteriole supplies blood to glomerulus and efferent arteriole collects blood from glomerulus. Therefore, the blood pressure in glomerulus becomes 75 mm of Hg. The smaller molecules of glucose, water, salts, ammonia etc. diffuse from glomerulus to Bowman's capsule and this process is called ultrafiltration. About 1.5-2.5% of water and solutes are removed from the blood plasma that flows through glomerulus. The quantity of glomerular filtrate formed each minutes in all nephrons of both kidneys is called the glomerular filtration rate. In a normal person, the glomerular filtration rate is about 125ml. per minute. (ii) Selective reabsorption: It is the process by which useful material are absorbed by the blood from glomerular filtrate. The tubular epithelial cells in different segments of nephron perform this either by active or passive mechanisms. Substances like glucose, amino acids, Na+, etc., in the filtrate are reabsorbed actively where as the nitrogenous wastes are absorbed by passive transport. In collecting tubules some water is absorbed. (iii) Selective secretion: The metabolic waste products like ammonia, hippuric acid, creatinine, H+ ions etc., present in the blood diffuses into DCT. This process is called selective secretion. It changes the complete composition of glomerular filtrate which is now called urine."
4,Q. 3.Human kidneys can produce urine nearly four times concentrated than the filtrate formed. Explain the mechanism of production of hypertonic urine.  Explain the counter current mechanism in Vasa Recta. Also mention its significance. (DDE 2017),Ans. Refer to NCERT Exemplar LAQ Q.1.
