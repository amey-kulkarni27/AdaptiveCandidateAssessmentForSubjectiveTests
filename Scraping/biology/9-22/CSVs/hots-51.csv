"Write a note on ""Regulation of Cardiac Activity""","Regulation of Cardiac Activity : (i) The special neural centre located in medulla oblongata of brain can moderate cardiac function through autonomic nervous system. Therefore, ANS helps in controlling heart regulation. (ii) The parasympathetic neural signals, (componentof ANS) decreases the rate of heart beat, speed of condition of action potential and also the cardiac output. (iii) The adrenal medullary hormones enhance cardiac output. (iv) The neural signals through sympathetic nerves may increase heart beat rate and the strength of ventricular contraction and also cardiac output."
"If a patients' ECG revealed an abnormally long delay between the P wave and the QRS deflection, what would that suggest?","If a patients' ECG revealed an abnormally long delay between P wave and the QRS deflection, it suggest that there is a delay of conduction from the atria to the ventricles, hence the stimulation from SA nodes are conducting stimuli very slowly to theventricles.
