0,Q. 1. Where does mitosis take place in plants and animals? What is its significance in multicellular organisms?. ,"Ans. It takes place both in somatic and reproductive cells of the plants and animals. In multicellular organisms, mitosis produces more cells for growth and repair. Mitosis division is responsible for growth and development of a single-celled zygote into a multicellular organism. Mitosis division helps in maintaining the proper size. Mitosis also helps in restoring wear and tear in body tissues, replacing damaged or lost part, healing wounds and regeneration of detached parts."
1,Q. 2. Draw a labelled diagram of anaphase of mitosis. Write any two key features of this phase.   ,"Ans. Two key features are: (i) Fibres uniting chromosomes with poles of spindle starts contraction until daughter chromosomes are completely distinct from one another. Contraction of fibres pulls the groups of chromosomes further apart to their respective poles. (ii) The chromosomes move to their poles through cytoplasm.

2,Q. 3. (i) What is meant by cytokinesis? (ii) How cytokinesis in plants differ from that in animals?  (iii) With reference to the cell types undergoing mitosis differentiate between animal cells and plant cells.,"Ans. (i) Cytokinesis is the cytoplasmic division of a cell at the end of mitosis or meiosis, which bring about the separation into two daughter cells. (ii) In animal cell, division of cytoplasm likes by cleavage while in plant cell, division of cytoplasm takes place by cell-plate formation. (iii) In plants & new cell wall is fashioned between the new daughter cells, while in animal cells the cell membrane constricts to pinch the parent cell into daughter cells."
3,Q. 4. What are the factors controlling cell division?,"Ans. Factors controlling cell division are: (i) Cell size: Cells capable of division attain a particular size and then undergo division. (ii) Karyoplasmic ratio: Rise in cell volume disturbs karyoplasmic ratio. It stimulates the cell to divide. (iii) Mitogens: Mitogens, are agents, factors or substances that trigger cell division."
4,"Q. 5. Differentiate between (i) S-phase and G2 phase, (ii) G1 phase and G2 phase.","Ans. (i) Meiosis: Meiosis is a double division that takes place in a diploid cell (2N) and involves reduction of chromosome number to half and forms four haploid cells. It reduces number of chromosomes to half. So it is popularly termed as the reduction division.  (ii) Amitosis : It is a simple method of cell division, also called direct cell division. In this, there is no differentiation of chromosomes and spindle. Nuclear envelope does not degenerate. Nucleus elongates and constricts in middle to form two daughter nuclei. It is followed by a centripetal constriction of cytoplasm to form 2 daughter cells. (iii) G2 phase (second growth phase) : It is also called pre-mitotic gap phase. It has double DNA content as compared to original cell (4C:2C). It produces macromolecules (RNAs, proteins) for multiplication of organelles, spindle formation and cell growth. G phase prepares a cell to undergo division."
5,Q. 7. Explain anaphase of mitosis briefly.   ,"Ans. Anaphase of Mitosis: (i) It begins by division of centromere. (ii) Fibres uniting chromosomes with poles of spindle begin contracting until daughter chromosomes are completely distinct from one another. (iii) Contraction of fibres pulls the groups of chromosomes further apart to their respective poles. (iv) Contraction of fibres and separation of two groups of chromosomes is very rapid. (v) The chromosomes move to their poles through cytoplasm. (vi) They assume characteristic V-, J- or I-shaped configuration. The centromere may be in centre or away from it or may be at terminal end. For diagram : Refer to SAQ-11/Q.2"
6,Q. 8. How do cytokinesis takes place in plants?,"Ans. In plants cytokinesis takes by two methods: (a) Cleavage method: This method occurs in lower plants. Cytoplasm undergo centripetal constriction in the middle to form two daughter protoplasts, each having a single nucleus. In furrow, pectin hemicellulose and microfibrils of cellulose are deposited to form a double wall. (b) Cell plate method: In this case, the spindle persists for some time, known as phragmoplast. Small vesicles produced by golgi apparatus collect at the equator of the phragmoplast. The membrane of vesicles fuse to form film which solidifies to form cell plate."
7,Q. 9. What is the necessity of meiosis II in meiosis inspite of the reduction division of meiosis I?,"Ans. At the end of Meiosis-I, two groups of chromosomes are produced, with each group having half the number of chromosomes present in the parent nucleus, therefore meiosis-I is called reductional division. But each chromosome is still a dyad i.e., formed of two sister chromatids joined at the common centromere. Though the chromosome number has been halved, each chromosome still has double (2N) amount of DNA. So there is need of meiosis-II during which sister chromatids of  each chromosome separate into different cells. Haploidy occurs even in DNA amount. The main purpose of meiosis-II is to separate genetically chromosomes formed during crossing over in meiosis-I."
8,Q. 10. Explain diakinesis of meiosis I division.,"Ans. Three events responsible for gametic consequences during meiosis are: (i) The pairing of the homologous chromosomes (ii) The process of crossing over and recombination, and (iii) The segregation of homologous chromosomes.  "
