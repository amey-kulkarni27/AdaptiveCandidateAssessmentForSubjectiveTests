0,Q. 2. Write short notes on hind brain. ,"Ans. The structural classification of neurons depends upon the number of dendrites extending from the cell body. (i) Multipolar neurons have one axon and several dendrites; the majority of neurons in the spinal cord and brain are multipolar. (ii) Bipolar neurons have only two processes: a single dendrite and an axon. Biopolar neurons are found in the sense organs-and in the retina of the eye and in olfactory cells. (iii) Unipolar neurons lack dendrites and have a single axon, and are also sensory neurons."
1,Q. 4. What are the different parts of fore brain?,Ans. The nervous system of higher animals performs three basic functions: (i) They receive sensory input from internal and external environment by nerves. (ii) They process the input information; and (iii) They respond to the stimuli transmitting motor commands to determine the response of the body parts or cells.
2,Q. 6. In how many parts human nervous system is divided?,"Ans. (i) Hypothalamus integrates and controls the visceral activities. (ii) It maintains homeostasis. (iii) It provides anatomical connection between the nervous and endocrine systems by its relationship to the pituitary gland. (iv) Hypothalamus is thermoregulatory centre. Hence it is called ""thermostat"" of the body. It keeps body temperature at roughly 37Â°C by means of a complex thermostat system. (v) It is also associated with behavioural activities. (vi) Appetite and thirst centres are located in the hypothalamus."
3,"Q. 17. What is the difference between unipolar, bipolar and multipolar neurons? Give one example of each.","Ans. Middle ear: The middle ear contains three ossicles called malleus, incus and stapes which are attached to one another in a chain-like fashion. The malleus is attached to the  tympanic membrane and the stapes is attached to the oval window of the cochlea. The ear ossicles increase the efficiency of transmission of sound waves to the inner ear. Eustachian tube help in equalising the pressure of either side of ear drum."
4,Q. 21. Name the two humours found inside the mammalian eye. List the functions they perform.,"Ans. The path travelled by an impulse in a reflex action is called the reflex arc. It consists of five parts: (i) A receptor or skin, the neurons of which start a sensory impulse. (ii) An afferent nerve, which brings sensory impulse from the receptor to the central nervous system. (iii) The neurons present in the spinal cord change the sensory impulse into the motor impulse. (iv) An efferent nerve, which carries the motor impulses from the spinal cord to the specific effectors like muscles fibres or gland cells. (v) An effector, where impulse terminates and response is given."
5,Q. 23. What is meant by 'reflex action'? Give one example. Name the components of a reflex arc in proper sequence from the receptor upto the effector.,Ans.
