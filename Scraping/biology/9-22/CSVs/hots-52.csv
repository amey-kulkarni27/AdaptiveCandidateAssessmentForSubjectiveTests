What happens when the membrane of a nerve cell carries out a sodium pump?,"(i) The membrane is in resting potential (−80𝑚𝑉). (ii) There is more Na+ ions on outside of axon membrane of ECF then inside of axon  membrane. (iii) K+ ions move out and the membrane is positively charged outside and negatively charged inside. (iv) When stimulus is applied, the axon membrane becomes negatively charged outside and positively charged inside. (v) Depolarized points becomes repolarized and Na+ ions move to outside while K+ ions inside. (vi) The process involves expelling out Na+ ions and drawing in K+ ions concentration."
