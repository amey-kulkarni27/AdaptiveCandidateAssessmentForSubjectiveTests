(b) β helix : More than one chain lie side by side joined together by hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl group of amino acids. (c) Collagen proteins: It is a right handed super helix formed by the twisting of three helices of polypeptide chains interwined with each other. (iii) Tertiary Structure : The tertiary structure of protein brings distant amino acid side, chains nearer to form active sites of enzyme proteins. The tertiary structure is maintained by weak bonds, such as hydrogen, ionic and hydrophilic hydrophobic bonds, formed between one part of a polypeptide and another The biological activity of a protein molecule depends largely on the specific tertiary structure Tertiary structure is found in globular proteins."

(i) On what basis are enzymes classified ? (ii) List any four classes of enzymes and mention their functions ? ,"Enzymes are classified according to their function and type of reaction in which they are taking part. Four main classes of enzymes are : (i) Oxidoreductases : These enzymes catalyze oxidation and reduction reactions, usually involving the transfer of hydrogen from one molecule to another. S reduced + S’ oxidized ------S oxidized + S’ reduced (ii) Transferases : These enzymes transfer a chemical group from one substrate to another but never hydrogen e.g. phosphotransferase catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from one molecule to another. (iii) Hydrolases : These enzymes carry out hydrolysis reactions i.e., breakdown of large molecules by addition of water e.g. lipases breakdown lipids into fatty acids and glycerol. (iv) Ligase or synthetase : These enzymes form bonds to join two molecules together, using energy supplied from the breakdown of ATP e.g. DNA ligase is used to repair breaks in DNA molecules. "
State the effect of chemicals on enzyme action with suitable example. ,"The enzymes are proteins having high molecular weight. Enzymes are highly specific in their action. Enzymes action can be inhibited by certain chemicals. It is called enzyme inhibition, e.g. noncompetitive inhibition. Non-competitive inhibition : Some chemicals act like poison and destroy the enzyme structure. Non-competitive inhibitors do not resemble the substrate in structure. They inhibit the enzyme action by binding to the enzyme at the place other than the active site, e.g. cyanide inhibits the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase which is necessary for respiration."
Enzymes are classified into different groups based on the reaction they catalyse. Write the name and function of each of these groups of enzymes.  In how many categories are enzymes classified?   ,"The modern system of enzyme classification was introduced by International Union of Biochemistry. It grouped enzymes into the following six categories : (i) Oxidoreductases : They take part in oxidation and reduction reactions or transfer of electrons. (ii) Transferases : They transfer group from one molecule to another e.g., glutamate pyruvate transaminase. (iii) Hydrolases : They break up large molecules into smaller ones with the help of hydrogen and hydroxyl groups of water molecules. The phenomenon is called hydrolysis. (iv) Lyases : The enzyme cause cleavage, removal of groups without hydrolysis, addition of groups to double bonds or reverse. e.g. aldolase. (v) Isomerase : The enzyme causes rearrangment of molecular structure to effect isomeric changes. These are of three types-isomerases, epimerases, mutase. (vi) Ligases : The enzyme catalyse bonding of two chemicals with the help of energy obtained from ATP. Е.g. pyruvate carboxylase."
What are the characteristics of enzymes?,"Enzymes-characteristics: (i) Approximately all the enzymes are proteinaceous in nature. An enzyme/protein has a primary structure (amino acid sequence of protein). Enzyme like protein has secondary and the tertiary structure. (ii) The backbone of protein chain folds upon itself, chain criss-crosses itself and so several crevices or pockets are made out. One pocket is known as ‘active site'. So the enzymes, through their active site, catalyse reactions at a high rate.  (iii) The enzymes get denatured at a high temperatures (above 40°C). The enzymes isolated from organisms who live under extremely high temperatures e.g., hot vents and sulphur springs, are stable and retain their catalytic power at high temperatures (upto 80°-90°C). (Any three)"
What is activation energy?,"Activation energy: It is the energy required to initiate a chemical or biochemical reaction. Activation energy overcomes the energy barrier of the reactants which occurs amongst the reactants due to (i) presence of electrons over their surface, (ii) absence of precise and forceful collisions, essential for bringing the reactive sites of the chemical together.  Fig. Activation energy requirement of non catalysed and enzyme catalysed chemical reaction"
What is enzymatic competitive inhibition? Give one example. 13]  [KVS 2012- ,"Enzymatic Competitive Inhibition: (i) Chemicals that prevent the enzyme to function, are known as inhibitors. (ii) Enzymatic competitive inhibition is done by the substance which closely resembles the substrate in its molecular structure. (iii) Enzyme + Inhibitor = Enzyme-inhibitor complex. (iv) The activity of the enzyme is limited by competitive inhibitor and no product is formed. Example: Malonate inhibits the action of succinic dehydrogenase because it shows close resemblance with the succinate substrate."
Describe the steps of catalytic cycle of an enzyme action. Enlist four steps involved in catalytic action of an enzyme.    ,"Steps of catalytic cycle of an enzyme action are: (i) The substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme. (ii) This binding of the substrate induces the enzymes to alter its shape and fit more closely around the substrate. (iii) The active site of the enzyme, now is in close proximity of the substrate breaks the chemical bonds of the substrate and an enzyme-product complex is formed. (iv) The enzyme releases the products of the reaction and the free enzyme is ready to take up another molecule of the substrate."
What is the effect of increase in substrate concentration on the rate of enzymatic reaction ? ,Increase in substrate concentration increases the rate of reaction. The enhanced rate is due to two factors : (i) Occupation of one and more active sites by the substrate molecules. (ii) Higher number of collisions between substrate molecules. The rise in velocity is quite high in the beginning but it decreases progressively with the increase in substrate concentration.
