Classify bacteria on the basis of their shape.,"Bacteria are classified as given below: (i) Cocci : They are oval or spherical in shape. When they occur singly, they are called Micrococcus; if in pairs Diplococcus; if in a chain, Streptococcus; and if occur in clusters, Staphylococcus. (ii) Bacilli: They are rod-like, with or without flagella. Flagella may be present at one or both the ends or around cells. Bacteria may occur singly, Bacillus; or in pairs, Diplobacillus or may form filaments, Streptobacillus. (ii) Vibrio : They are small and curved like commas. These are mostly motile. (iv) Spirillum : These are twisted like a screw. They have flagella at one end or both the ends. Certain bacteria possess flagella for locomotion."
Describe the major groups of Protista.,"The kingdom Protista includes unicellular, eukaryotic organisms. They include both Posynthetic and non-photosynthetic forms. The kingdom Protista includes protistan algae, slime moulds and protozoans. (i) Protistan algae: They are photosynthetic protists. They include dinoflagellates and diatoms. (a) Dinoflagellates: These are golden brown biflagellated Photosynthetic protists. They possess cellulose wall in the form of distinct interlocking plates. (b) Diatoms: They are group of golden brown Photosynthetic protists which are covered by two valved silicious wall called shell or frustule. They pile up at the bottom water reservoirs and form big heap called diatomite. (ii) Slime moulds : Slime moulds are both plants and animals like. They are plant like in the production of spores, and animal like in the mode of nutrition and somatic organisation. It moves freely on the substratum and feeds on bacteria, fungal and algal spores and also absorb nutrients directly from the substratum. (iii) Protozoa : These are microscopic unicellular organisms with varied shapes and forms. This may be free living, commensal or parasitic. They lack cell wall, but some possess proteinaceous flexible pellicle. Locomotion occurs by pseudopodia, flagella or cilia. These reproduce asexually by binary fission. Some reproduce sexually by conjugation."
Write Short notes on: (i) Methanogens (ii) Halophiles (iii) Thermoacidophiles. ,"(i) Cyanobacteria or blue-green algae are gram(+) photosynthetic prokaryotes which perform oxygenic photosynthesis (ii) Cell structure is typically prokaryotic-one envelope organisation with peptidoglycan wall naked DNA, 70S ribosomes, devoid of membrane bound cell organelles. (iii) The outer part of the protoplast contains a number of photosynthetic thylakoids. It is called as chromoplasm. (iv) Their membranes contain chlorophyll a, carotenes and xanthophylls. Chlorophyll b is absent. (v) DNA lies coiled generally in central part of the cytoplasm known as centroplasm. (vi) Small circular DNA segments may also occur in nucleoid, known as plasmid or transposons."
What are the salient features of kingdom Fungi? ,"Kingdom Fungi : The kingdom fungi, includes achlorophyllous, spore producing, multicellular, eukaryotic organisms . Salient features: (i) The body of fungi is filamentous called mycelium. The filaments are known as hyphae. (ii) The hyphae are either multicellular or coenocytic i.e. multinucleate and without cross walls. (iii) The cell wall contain chitin and non-cellulosic polysaccharides N-acetyl - glucosamine. (iv) They have two envelop type of cellular organisation. (v) The are heterotrophic with absorptive type of nutrition. It is either saprobic or parasitic. Saprobic fungi excrete digestive enzymes in the external medium to make complex organic matter soluble for absorption. Parasitic fungi absorb nourishment directly from another living organism called host. (vi) Reserve food is glycogen and fat. (vii) Reproduction is both asexual and sexual. Asexual reproduction takes place by spores like zoospores, conidia, ascospores and basidiospores. Sexual reproduction involves fusion of similar gametes. In some fungi, the fusion of two haploid (n) cells results in diploid (2n) cell or zygote. (viii) Many fungi act as decomposers and mineralisers and thus, play an important role in nutrient cycling in the biosphere."
Q. 8.. Explain in detail the various methods of asexual reproduction in fungi.,Kingdom Plantae contains all photosynthetic eukaryotic multicellular organisms and their non-photosynthetic relatives..  The salient features of kingdom Plantae are: (i) Organisms are multicellular except for some algae. (ii) They are eukaryotic. (iii) Body form is less regular and Growth is usually indefinite. (iv) Mode of nutrition is oxygenic photosynthesis. (v) The photosynthetic regions contain chlorophyll. (vi) The plants are usually fixed or free-floating. (vii) Structural differentiation into tissues is found except for certain algae. (viii) The cells contain central vacuoles. (ix) Food reserve is usually starch and fat. (x) Some of the plants are heterotrophic such as insectivorous plants. (xi) Reproduction is both asexual and sexual. Accessory spores are present in lower plants.
