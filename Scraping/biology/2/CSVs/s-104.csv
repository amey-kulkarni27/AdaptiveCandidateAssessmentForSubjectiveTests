Light is not necessary.  (iii)  Photosynthetic bacteria have bacterio-chlorophyll which help in trapping the solar energy and converting it into chemical energy.  The energy required for synthesis of food is obtained by oxidizing chemical substances found in the surrounding medium. 
1,Q. 2. Distinguish between autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria.,Ans. S. No. (i)  (ii) (iii)  Autotrophic Bacteria The bacteria synthe-sise their own food.  Heterotrophic Bacteria  They depend on an external sources of energy for synthesis of food. Autotrophic bacteria live on inorganic substrata.  An external source of energy is not required. Heterotrophic Bacteria live on organic substratum Or living host.  The bacteria obtain organic food or organic growth factors from outside sources.

(iii) Locomotion occurs by pseudopodia, flagella and cilia. (iv) They Show heterotrophic mode of nutrition which may be holozoic, parasitic or saprobic.  (v) These reproduces asexually by binary fission."
3,Q. 4. Draw a well labelled diagram to show E.M view of a cyanobacterial cell.,Ans. 
4,Q. 5. What are chemoautotrophic bacteria? How they obtain energy+?,"Ans. (i) Diatoms are an important source of food to aquatic animals. (ii) Diatomite is porous and chemically inert, therefore used in filtration of sugar, alcohols and antibiotics. (iii) It is also employed as a cleansing agent in tooth pastes and metal polishes. (iv) It is also employed as insulation material in refrigerators, boilers and furnaces.  "
