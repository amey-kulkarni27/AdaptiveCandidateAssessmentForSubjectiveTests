The drawbacks of this classification are: (i) First formed animals were neither plants nor animals. (ii) Fungi differ in structure, physiology and reproductive details from plants. (iii) At lower level of organisation there are several instances where the distinction of plant and animal disappears ."
List out the major groups of protozoans.  (KVS 2017) ,Major groups of protozoans are: (i) Amoeboid protozoa (ii) Flagellated protozoans. (iii) Ciliated protozoans. (iv) Sporozoans.
Give the features of kingdom protista.,"(i) Slime moulds are both plant and animal like. (ii) They are plant like in the production of spores during reproduction and animal like in the mode of nutrition. (iii) Their somatic structures consist of wall-less, multinucleate mobile mass of protoplasm called plasmodium. (iv) They absorb nutrients directly substratum.

(ii) Nuclei of the multicellular plasmodia are haploid (n). As there is no fusion of individual cells, this aggregated mass of cells is called the pseudoplasmodium."
What are archaebacteria ?,"(i) some bacteria can survive in extreme environmental conditions like high temperature, high concentration, in absence of oxygen or in presence of oxygen in high acidic or alkaline pH. Such bacteria are called archaebacteria. (ii) Their cell wall consists of non-cellulosic polysaccharide or protein and lacks peptidoglycan. This allows them to survive in extreme conditions.  "
