2,Q. 5. Give the features of kingdom protista.,"Ans. (i) Slime moulds are both plant and animal like. (ii) They are plant like in the production of spores during reproduction and animal like in the mode of nutrition.

(i) some bacteria can survive in extreme environmental conditions like high temperature, high concentration, in absence of oxygen or in presence of oxygen in high acidic or alkaline pH. Such bacteria are called archaebacteria. (ii) Their cell wall consists of non-cellulosic polysaccharide or protein and lacks peptidoglycan. This allows them to survive in extreme conditions.  "
