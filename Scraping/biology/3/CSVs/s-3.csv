Describe the gametophytic phase exhibited by moss.,"The predominant stage in the life cycle of moss is the gametophyte which consists of two stages: (a) The first stage is the protonema stage which develops directly from a spore; it is a creeping, green branched and flamentous stage.

Describe the types of roots found in Cycas & Pinus.,"The roots of gymnosperms are generally tap root. In Cycas, the roots are of two typesnormal and coralloid. The coralloid roots are irregular negatively geotropic, devoid of root. These are associated with nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria. In Pinus, besides the normal roots there are the mycorrhizal roots which have fungal association in the form of mycorrhiza."

(iii) Plants which live for a year, or part of year are termed as annuals; which live for two years are termed as biennials and which live for more than two years are termed as perennials. (iv) Plants which live in extremely dry conditions are termed as xerophytes: plants living in water are termed as hydrophytes and those living in moderate conditions are termed as mesophyies.
