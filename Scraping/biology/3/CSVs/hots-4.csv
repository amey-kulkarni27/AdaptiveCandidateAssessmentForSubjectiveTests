0,Q. 1. Why bryophytes do not attain great heights?,Ans. Bryophytes seldom achieve great heights. The possible reasons are : (i) Absence of roots. (ii) Materials are transported from cell to cell. (iii) Absence of vascular tissues (iv) Absence of cuticle on the plant body (v) Requirement of external shcet of water for capillary conduction to all parts and transport of male gametes.
1,Q. 2. Describe the similarities in sexual reproduction of Moss and Fern.,Ans. Similarities in sexual reproduction of Moss and Fern : (i) Oogamous mode of sexual reproduction which involves fertilization of non-motile female gamete or egg by means of a motile gamete or sperm. (ii) The male sex organs consists of a jacket of sterile cells that enclose a spermatogenous tisue (sperm mother cells). Sperms ane flagellate. (iii) Female sex organs or archegonia are flask-shaped with a tubular neck and a swollen basal venter. Venter encloses a single egg or oosphere. (iv) An exteenal source of water is needed for the swimming of the sperms so as to reach the open archegonia. (v) Dependence of the embryo upon gametophytic phase. Occurrence of heteromorphic alternation of generation.
2,Q. 3. What are the reasons for dominance of vascular plants on land?,"Ans. The reasons for dominance of vascular plants on land are : (i) Presence of deep, penetrating and wide spreading roots which anchor the plant and also absorb water and mineral salts. (ii) Covering of aerial parts with water proofing material like cutin in living tissues. (iii) Occurrence of mechanical tissues to provide support to aerial parts and to allow them to rise to great heights (iv) Presence of long distance transport system in the form of vascular tissues."
3,"Q. 4. ""A seed encloses three generations one within the others"", Justify the statement.","Ans. (i) The ovule or megasporangium formed from the parent sporophyte is diploid (2n). (ii) An ovule consist of integment and nucellus. Both of them are diploid and belongs to sporophytic genetation.  (iii) The megaspores developing within the ovule is formed by melosis and is haploid (n). The megaspore develops into haploid female gametophyte which develops into an egg (n). (iv) This represents haploid (n) gametophytic generation. The egg is then fertilized by a male gamete, to form a diploid (2n) zygote."
4,Q. 5. How many types of life cycle does green algae exhibit? Explain.,"Ans. The green algae exhibits three types of life cycles: (i) Haplontic (ii) Diplontic (ii) Diplohaplontic (i) Haplontic : (a) The dominant phase is haploid, while diploid stage is present only in the form of zygote or zygospores. (b) Meiosis occur at the time of zygote germination 𝑒. 𝑔. 𝐶ℎ𝑙𝑎𝑚𝑦𝑑𝑜𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑠, 𝑈𝑙𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑖𝑥, and 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑟𝑜𝑔𝑦𝑟𝑎. (ii) Diplontic : (a) The dominant phase in the life cycle is diploid. (b) Gametes are produced through meiosis. (c) They represent haploid phase. (d) The diploid phase is restored as a result of fusion of gametes eg 𝐶𝑎𝑢𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑝𝑎. (iii) Diplohaplontic : (a) In this life cycle, both diploid and haploid phase are well developed and multicellular. (b) They are respectively called sporophyte and gametophyte. (c) The haploid gametophyte produces haploid gametes, which fuse into diploid zygote. (d) The diploid zygote grow into a diploid sporophyte.The latter produce haploid spores or meiospores through meiosis. (e) New gametophytes are produced by the germination of meiospores. (f) Thus, this cycle exhibits alternation of generation, between haploid and diploid multicellular generations.  "
