0,Q. 1. Briefly describe the types of xylem.,"Ans. Depending upon the time of origin and internal structure, the xylem is of two types: (i) Protoxylem: It is first or easily formed xylem. It is made up of small tracheids and vessels, with annular or spiral thickenings. (ii) Metaxylem: It is later formed xylem. It consist of larger tracheids and vessels and have reticulate, scalariform and pitted thickenings."
1,Q. 2. What are tissues? What are their main groups?,"Ans. Tissue: A group of similar or dissimilar cells having a common origin and co-operating with one another to perform a similar or a set of similar functions is called a tissue. Plant tissues have been classified into two fundamental types: (1) Meristematic tissue: These are the tissues which are made up of group of immature and similar cells and are in continuous state of division, forming new cells. (2) Permanent tissue: These are composed of mature cells which have definite shape, size and functions and have lost the power of divisions."
2,Q. 3. Write any three main functions of parenchymatous tissues.,"Ans. (i) Parenchyma cells contain chloroplasts and take part in photosynthesis, so they are known as chlorenchyma. Thus, they are meant for storage of food. (ii) Paremchyma have fibre like prosenchyma which is meant for providing turgidity and strength. (iii) Parenchyma in aquatic plants possess air spaces, and are known as aerenchyma which stores air and provides buoyancy to aquatic plants."
3,Q. 4. Write differences between vessels and tracheids.,Ans. S. No.  Vessels  Tracheid  (i)  Vessels are longer and may be as long as 10 cm.  They are comparatively short and are usually upto 1 mm. in length.  (ii)  A Vessel is composed of a row of cells placed one above the other. Vessels are comparatively wider.  A tracheid is a single cell which is elongated and has tapering end walls.  (iii)  Tracheids are comparatively narrower. 
4,Q. 5. Name the main components of xylem. Which of these is suitable for carrying water and why?,"Ans. The main components of xylem are: (i) Tracheids, (ii) Vessels, (ii) Xylem parenchyma, (ii) Xylem fibres. (i) Tracheids and vessels are responsible for the conduction of water and minerals because they are elongated tubular channels with wide lumen. (ii) Xylem tracheids possesses pits with pores and vessels possess perforated plates through which they are able to conduct water and minerals from one cell to the another."
5,Q. 6. (1) What is periderm? How does periderm formation take place in dicot? (ii) How are vascular bundles arranged in monocot root?,"Ans. (i) Periderm: The cork, cork cambium and secondary cortex collectively form a protective tissue called periderm. In order to increase in girth and prevent rupturing of the outer ground tissues due to the formation of secondary vascular tissues, dicot stems produce a cork cambium or phellogen in the outer cortical cells. Phellogen cells divide on both the outer side as well as the inner side to form secondary tissue. The secondary tissue produced on the inner side of the phellogen is parenchymatous. It is called secondary cortex or phelloderm. Phellogen produce cork or phellem on the outer side. The phelloderm, phellogen and phellem together constitute the periderm. (ii) The vascular bundles are arranged in the form of ring around the central pit. The xylem bundles are exarch, i.e., protoxylem lies towards the outer side while the metaxylem faces inwards. Phloem bundles alternate with xylem bundles."
6,"Q. 7. The transverse section of a plant material shows the following features: vascular bundles are conjoint, closed and scattered and are surrounded by the sclerenchymatous bundles sheath. What will you identify it as? Also, write any other four features of this specimen. ","Ans. It is a monocot stem. It is characterised by conjoint, collateral, and closed vascular bundles, scattered in the ground tissue containing the parenchyma. Each vascular bundles is surrounded by sclerenchymatous bundle-sheath cells. Other four features are: (i) Vascular bundles are scattered in the ground tissue. (ii) Y-shaped xylem endarch condition. (iii) Cambium is absent. (iv) Phloem parenchyma and medullary rays are absent in monocot stems."
7,Q. 8. Differentiate between: (i) Early wood and late wood (ii) Heart wood and sap wood,"Ans. (i) Differences between early wood and late wood:  S. No.  Early Wood  Late Wood  (i)  It is produced during the favourable period of the year.  (ii)  Early wood constitutes the major part of the annual ring.  It is formed towards the close of the active growing period of the year just before the arrival of unfavourable period. Late wood forms a narrow strip in the annual ring.  (iii)  The wood is lighter in colour.  The wood is darker.  (iv)  It has lower density.  It has higher density.  (ii) Difference between heartwood and sapwood. S. No.  Heartwood  Sapwood  (i)  It is the central wood of an old stem.  It is outer wood of an old stem.  (ii)  Heartwood is dark coloured.  It is light coloured.  (iii)  Living cells are absent.  Living cells are Present.  (iv)  Tracheary elements have deposition of tannins, resins, gums etc.  Tracheary elements do not possess any deposition in their lumen. "
8,Q. 9. Describe the types of vascular bundle found in angiosperms. ,"Ans. Types of vascular bundles in angiosperms: In angiosperms vascular bundles occur in distinct patches. Based on the arrangement in the plant body. These are radial in roots and conjoint in case of stems and leaves. (i) Radial Bundles: Here xylem and phloem are arranged separately in different radii, called xylem bundles and phloem bundles. (ii) Conjoint Bundles: In this type, the xylem and phloem lie together on the same radius with phloem on the outer side and xylem towards the inner side Based on the presence or absence of cambium, vascular bundles are divided into open and closed vascular bundles. When a strip of cambium is present between xylem and phloem, they are called as open bundles while if cambium strip is absent between xylem and phloem, they are called closed bundles. Open bundles are characteristics of dicot plants whereas closed bundles are characteristics of monocot plants only."
9,Q. 10. Draw a nearly labelled diagram of T.S. Dicot stem. (Any six correct labellings) (DDE 2017),Ans. Refer to LAQ Q.5. 
10,Q. 11. Distinguish between primary and secondary xylem.,Ans. S. No.  Primary xylem  Secondary xylem  (i)  It is developed from Procambium.  It is developed from vascular cambium.  (ii)  There are no medullary or any rays in primary xylem.  There are rays in the secondary xylem.  (iii)  It is concerned with the growth of the primary plant body.  It is concerned with the secondary growth of the plant.  (iv)  It is associated with the formation of patches in-side the vascular bundle around the pith.  It constitutes the continuous cylinder around the pith. 
11,Q. 12. How are secondary vascular tissues formed in dicot roots?,"Ans. (i) The primary dicot roots lack cambium. (ii) The vascular cambium appear later as a secondary meristem, which develops partially from conjunctive parenchyma and partially from Pericycle. (iii) The parenchyma cells lying beneath the phloem bundles become meristematic to form cambium strips. (iv) The cells of the Pericycle just outside the protoxylem also become meristematic and joins with the cambium strips to form a wavy band of cambium ring. (v) This cambium ring form secondary xylem on the inner side and secondary phloem on the outer side. (vi) The cambium is always more active towards the inner side during the formation of secondary vascular tissues."
12,Q. 13. Distinguish between primary and secondary meristems.,"Ans. S. No.  Primary meristems  Secondary meristems  (i)  It originates from embroyonal meristem. Example are root apex and shoot apex.  It originates from permanent tissues by regaining of meristematic activity. Examples are cambium and vascular.  (ii)  Made of isodiametric cells. No large vacuoles are found.  Consist of tangentially elongated cells having rectangular outerline in section and possess vacuoles.  (iii)  It gives rise to all primary tissues including intrafascicular cambium.  It forms secondary xylem, secondary phloem, secondary cortex and cock.  (iv)  It is responsible for longitudinal growth.  It causes radial growth of stems and roots. "
13,Q. 14. What is the significance of secondary growth?,"Ans. The significance of secondary growth are: (i) The secondary growth adds girth to the plant. It provides support by increasing width of the aerial growth. (ii) It produces a corky bark around the tree trunk that protects the interior parts from abrasion, heat cold and infection. (iii) It adds new conducting tissues for replacing old non-functioning ones as well as for meeting increased demand for long distance transport of sap and organic nutrients.  "
