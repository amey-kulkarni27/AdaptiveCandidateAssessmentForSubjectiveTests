Write any four important functions of each : (i) Epithelial tissue (ii) Connective tissue (iii) Muscular tissue.,"Labelled diagram of alimentary canal of cockroach : Refer to SAQ-IIQ 2. Functions : Crop : The oesophagus dilates to form a large thin walled pear shaped crop. The crop is very large part of the alimentary canal of the cockroach where food is stored. It opens into gizzard. Gizzard : It is a thick walled, rounded structure whose walls are muscular and greatly folded. It has six muscular folds which are covered by chitinous conical plates, the teeth, used for grinding the food. Its wall consists of strong circular muscles which are needed by the gizzard for grinding."
Draw a labelled diagram of male reproductive system of cockroach. What is the function of testes in the reproductive system of cockroach.,"Reproductive system of male cockroach. Function of testes : There are two testes which occupy dorso-lateral position just beneath the 4th to 6th abdominal terga. The testes are prominent in young insects, but get reduced in adults. They are full of sperms. The sperms produced by the follicles of the testes are transferred to the vas deferens through the vasa efferentia. "
"(i) Name the three regions of alimentary canal of Cockroach. (ii) Mention the role of gizzard, hepatic caeca and malpighian tubules in the alimentary canal of Cockroach. (iii) How many segments are there in the thoracic region of Cockroach? (iv) What does paurometabolous mean with reference to Cockroach? (v) Why is the eye of cockroach called as compound eye?","(i) (a) Fore gut, Mid gut and Hind gut (ii) Role of Gizzard, Hepatic caecae and Malpighian tubules are as follows: (a) Gizzard: The crop opens posteriorly into a small thick walled, muscular gizzard. They help in grinding the food. (b) Hepatic caecae: Hepatic caecae open at start of midgut and secrete many digestive enzymes-lipase, protease, peptidase, amylase, maltase, lactase, invertase and chitinase. (c) Malpighian tubules: The malpighian tubules help in removal of excretory products from the haemolymph. (iii) Three segments. (iv) Paurometabolous with reference to cockroach means a simple, gradual direct metamorphosis in which immature forms resemble the adult except in size and referred to as nymph. (v) Cockroach eyes are called compound eyes because they are made up of repeating units, the ommatidia, each of which function as a separate receptor."
Describe the external morphology of cockroach.,"Body of cockroach is elongated and dorsoventrally flattened. It is red brown in colour. Males are larger than females. Body is covered by brown chitinous exoskeleton. Cockroach is nocturnal and the body is segmented. It is divided into three distinct parts: (i) Head: The head is triangular. It lies anteriorly at right angles to the longitudinal body axis. Head is formed by the fusion of six segments. The head is flexible and is covered by head capsule, The head bears two sessile compound eyes, one on each of its side. Two thread-like long antennae arise from membranous sockets. They are very sensitive, The anterior end of head bears mouth. Mouth part comprises labrum, a pair of mandibles, a pair of maxilla and labium. There is a medium lobe, hypopharynx which acts like tongue. (ii) Thorax: It consists of 3 segments: (i) Prothorax, (ii) mesothorax, (iii) metathorax. Head is connected with the thorax by a short extension of the prothorax called the neck. Large sclerites covers the prothorax and shields the mesothorax Each thoracic segment bears two walking legs, each leg has 5 segments: (1) coxa, (ii) trochanter, (iii) femur, (iv) tibia, (v) tarsus. The first and second pairs of wings arises from mesothorax and metathorax respectively. The fore wings are called tegmina. Wings are used for flight.  (iii) Abdomen: In both mnale and female it consists of 10 segments. The seventh sternum is boat-shaped in females and together with eighth and ninth sterna makes a broad genital pouch. The tenth segment bears two jointed filamentous structures which are known as anal cerci. The 9th segment bears a pair of short, thread-like style which lies ventral to anal cirri. The anal styles are not found in female cockroach.  "
