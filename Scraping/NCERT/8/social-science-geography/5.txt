Chapter 5 – Industries Summary
The industry refers to economic activity that is concerned with the production of goods, extraction of minerals or the provision of services. Industrial activities are divided in three sectors – Primary sector, Secondary sector and tertiary sector. Industries are divided on the basis of raw material, size and ownership.
Raw materials are basic materials that are used in any industry and they can be classified on the basis of raw materials.
Industries based on raw materials are agro-based, mineral-based and forest-based.
Size of Industries refers to the amount of capital invested, number of people employed and the volume of production. Industries are classified into two types based on size: small scale and large scale industries.
Small scale industries manufacture products by hand and includes cottage and household industry. These industries use a lesser amount of capital and technology. For example, basket-weaving, pottery and other handicraft industries.
Large scale industries produce large volumes of products. The investment of capital is higher, and technology is superior. For example, the production of automobiles and heavy machinery.
After independence, India gave emphasis to this sector for development.
Ownership: Industries based on ownership can be classified as:
Private Sector Industries owned and operated by individuals or a group of individuals. For example, Bharat Heavy Electrical Ltd., Indian Oil Corporation.
Public sector industries owned and operated by the government. For example, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and Steel Authority of India Limited.
