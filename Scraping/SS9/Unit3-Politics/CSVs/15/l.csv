How are ‘polls’ conducted in India?,"            The final stage of an election is the day when the voters cast their votes in a polling booth. That day is usually called the Election Day.

Once the voter goes inside the booth, the election officials identify him or her by putting a mark on his or her finger and allow him or her to cast the vote. An agent of each candidate is allowed to sit inside the polling booth and ensure that the voting takes place in a fair way. A ballot paper is placed in which the names of the contesting candidates along with their party name and symbols are listed. Nowadays, Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) are used to record votes.
