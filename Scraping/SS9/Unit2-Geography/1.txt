Long Answer Questions

Q.1. What is density of population? Give Indiaâ€™s population
distribution by density with the reasons responsible for the same.
Ans. Density of population is calculated as the number of persons per unit
area. The population density of India in 2011 was 382 persons per sq. km.

(i) Regions with sparse population density: Rugged terrain and
unfavourable climatic conditions are primarily responsible for sparse
population in these areas. For example, Jammu and Kashmir, Arunachal
Pradesh and Mizoram.
(ii) Regions with moderate population density: Hilly, dissected and
rocky nature of terrain, moderate to low rainfall, shallow and less fertile soils
have influenced the population densities in these areas. For example, Assam
and peninsular states.
(iii) Regions with high density of population: These areas have high
population density because of the flat plains with fertile soils and abundant
rainfall. For example, Northern plains and Kerala.
