Q. 1. Explain the statement “Certain groups of weavers were in a better position than others to survive the competition with mill industries“.,"Ans.  Certain groups of weavers were in a better position than others to survive the completion with mill industries. Amongst weavers some produced course cloth while others wove finer varieties.  The demand for the finer varieties bought by the well-to-do was more stable. The rich could buy these even when the poor starved.  Famines didn’t affect the sale of Banarasi or Baluchari saris.  Moreover mills could not imitate specialized weavers.  Saris with woven borders or the famous lungis and handkerchiefs of madras, could not be easily displaced by mill production. ","How did this happen? This was partly because of technological changes. Handicrafts people adopt new technology if that helps them improve production without excessively pushing up costs. So, by the second decade of the twentieth century we find weavers using looms with a fly shuttle. This increased productivity per worker, speeded up production and reduced labour demand. By 1941, over 35 per cent of handlooms in India were fitted with fly shuttles: in regions like Travancore, Madras, Mysore, Cochin, Bengal the proportion was 70 to 80 per cent. There were several other small innovations that helped weavers improve their productivity and compete with the mill sector. 98 2020-21
 New words Fly shuttle – It is a mechanical device used for weaving, moved by means of ropes and pullies. It places the horizontal threads ( called the weft) into the verticle threads (called the warp). The invention of the fly shuttle made it possible for weavers to operate large looms and weave wide pieces of cloth.
 Certain groups of weavers were in a better position than others to survive the competition with mill industries. Amongst weavers some produced coarse cloth while others wove finer varieties. The coarser cloth was bought by the poor and its demand fluctuated violently. In times of bad harvests and famines, when the rural poor had little to eat, and their cash income disappeared, they could not possibly buy cloth. The demand for the finer varieties bought by the well-to-do was more stable. The rich could buy these even when the poor starved. Famines did not affect the sale of Banarasi or Baluchari saris. Moreover, as you have seen, mills could not imitate specialised weaves. Saris with woven borders, or the famous lungis and handkerchiefs of Madras, could not be easily displaced by mill production. Weavers and other craftspeople who continued to expand production through the twentieth century, did not necessarily prosper. They lived hard lives and worked long hours. Very often the entire household – including all the women and children – had to work at various stages of the production process. But they were not simply remnants of past times in the age of factories. Their life and labour was integral to the process of industrialisation.

Q. 2. Why did the population of London city expand over the 19th century ? Explain.    Or 		The city of London had a powerful migrant population. Explain the reason.  Or 		Why the population of London multiplied in the late 19th and early 20th century ?,"Ans. The population of London multiplied four fold in the 70 years between 1810 and 1880 increasing from 1 million to 4 millions.  London was a powerful magnet for migrant population , even though it did not have large factories.  19th Century London was a city of clerks and shopkeepers of small traders and skilled artisans, semi-skilled and sweated out workers of soldiers and servants of casual workers, street sellers and beggars.  There was a dockyard which provided opportunities of livelihood. 5 marks each  There were five major types of industries employed large numbers; clothing and footwear, wood and furniture, metals and engineering, printing and stationery and precious products.  During First World War the number of large factories increased and a large number of people joined the new created jobs. ","As food prices fell, consumption in Britain rose. From the midnineteenth century, faster industrial growth in Britain also led to higher incomes, and therefore more food imports. Around the world – in Eastern Europe, Russia, America and Australia – lands were cleared and food production expanded to meet the British demand. It was not enough merely to clear lands for agriculture. Railways were needed to link the agricultural regions to the ports. New harbours had to be built and old ones expanded to ship the new cargoes. People had to settle on the lands to bring them under cultivation. This meant building homes and settlements. All these activities in turn required capital and labour. Capital flowed from financial centres such as London. The demand for labour in places where labour was in short supply – as in America and Australia – led to more migration.

Q. 3. Explain any five sources of entertainment which came up in the 19th century in England to provide leisure activities. Or 		 Describe five forms of entertainment that came up in the 19th century England.  Or 		 How did people of different classes organise their new found leisure in England ? Explain.  				 ,"Ans.  For the wealthy Londoners, there was the annual ‘London Season’ where elite groups could enjoy several cultural events such as the opera and theatre.  Working classes too had their own means of entertainment. They used to meet in pubs and enjoy a drink, exchange news and discuss political events.  The establishment of libraries, museums and art galleries provided entertainment to common people.  Music halls and later cinema houses became a source of mass entertainment.  Industrial workers spent holidays by the sea shore and enjoyed both sun and the wind which was a great source of entertainment.","In many industries the demand for labour was seasonal. Gas works and breweries were especially busy through the cold months. So they needed more workers to meet their peak demand. Bookbinders and printers, catering to Christmas demand, too needed extra hands before December. At the waterfront, winter was the time that ships were repaired and spruced up. In all such industries where production fluctuated with the season, industrialists usually preferred hand labour, employing workers for the season.
 Source A Will Thorne is one of those who went in search of seasonal work, loading bricks and doing odd jobs. He describes how job-seekers walked to London in search of work: ‘I had always wanted to go to London, and my desire … was stimulated by letters from an old workmate … who was now working at the Old Kent Road Gas Works … I finally decided to go … in November, 1881. With two friends I started out to walk the journey, filled with the hope that we would be able to obtain employment, when we get there, with the kind assistance of my friend … we had little money when we started, not enough to pay for our food and lodgings each night until we arrived in London. Some days we walked as much as twenty miles, and other days less. Our money was gone at the end of the third day … For two nights we slept out – once under a haystack, and once in an old farm shed … On arrival in London we tried to find … my friend … but … were unsuccessful. Our money was gone, so there was nothing for us to do but to walk around until late at night, and then try to find some place to sleep. We found an old building and slept in it that night. The next day, Sunday, late in the afternoon, we got to the Old Kent Gas Works, and applied for work. To my great surprise, the man we had been looking for was working at the time. He spoke to the foreman and I was given a job.’ Quoted in Raphael Samuel, ‘Comers and Goers’, in H.J. Dyos and Michael Wolff, eds, The Victorian City: Images and Realities, 1973.

"Q. 4. Explain the social changes in London which led to the need for the underground railways. 		  Or 		Why did underground railway soon become a necessity in London? Mention any three disadvantages of this system ?  Or 		Explain the benefits of London Tube railway for the population in the city.  Or 		Why was the underground railway criticized in London ? Explain the reasons.  Or 		 “Even though the underground railway eventually became a huge success, it was opposed by many people initially.” Explain five valid reasons for this opposition. ","Ans.  Attempts were made to decongest the city of London and solve the housing crisis. So, the British government built houses for working classes. All these efforts expanded the city and people found it difficult to walk to their work places. This made the underground rail transport essential for London. Disadvantages : The development of the underground railways was criticized because.  The underground railways were considered a menace to health due to the lack of oxygen created in the compartments by smoking pipes, fumes of gas lamps and coal dust.  A large number of houses for poor were displaced for its construction.  It added to the mess and unhealthy environment of the city.  People were afraid to travel underground.  Many felt that ‘iron monsters’ added to the mass and unhealthiness of the city.  To make approximately two miles of railways, 900 houses had to be destroyed. ","Fig. 12 – A shallow underground railway being constructed in central London, Illustrated Times, 1868. From the 1850s railway stations began coming up all over London. This meant a demand for large numbers of workers to dig tunnels, erect timber scaffolding, do the brick and iron works. Job-seekers moved from one construction site to another.

Q. 5. Ties between members of households loosened in Britain in the era of industrialization. Explain the statement.  Or 		“The function and shape of the family were completely transformed by life in the industrial city”. Support the statement with examples. ,"Ans. In the 18th century, the family had been a unit of production and consumption as well as of political decision-making. There was a big change in the newer pattern.  Ties between members of household loosened.  The institution of marriage among the working class tended to break down.  Women of the upper and middle classes in Britain, faced increasingly higher level of isolation although their lives were made easier by maids.  Women who worked for wages had some control over their lives particularly among the lower social classes.  By the 20th century, the urban family had been transformed again partly by experience of the war time and partly work done by the comen ","processes were brought together under one roof and management. This allowed a more careful supervision over the production process, a watch over quality, and the regulation of labour, all of which had been difficult to do when production was in the countryside. In the early nineteenth century, factories increasingly became an intimate part of the English landscape. So visible were the imposing new mills, so magical seemed to be the power of new technology, that contemporaries were dazzled. They concentrated their attention on the mills, almost forgetting the bylanes and the workshops where production still continued.

"Q. 6. Explain any five changes that took place in the family life in the 18th century, which promoted individualism in the city life.  Or 		Explain any five social changes that took place in the family life in the 18th century in London.  Or Explain the social changes, ‘Family’ as an institution underwent in Britain in the era of industrialization. ","Ans. ‘Family’ as an institution underwent a social change due to industralization.  The class Kant joint family in the village scenario disappeared in the town and cities. The bond between family members loosened.  Women lost their jobs to machines.  Rich upper class women lived easier lives as they were served by domestic maids who made their work easier.  Forced to live at home in urban areas, leading them to face isolation at home.  Public places were dominated by males and females were confined to the home.  Women gradually began to participate in political movements to ask for their rights.  Families were small or nuclear. ","In Western and parts of Central Europe the growth of industrial production and trade meant the growth of towns and the emergence of commercial classes whose existence was based on production for the market. Industrialisation began in England in the second half of the eighteenth century, but in France and parts of the German states it occurred only during the nineteenth century. In its wake, new social groups came into being: a working-class population, and middle classes made up of industrialists, businessmen, professionals. In Central and Eastern Europe these groups were smaller in number till late nineteenth century. It was among the educated, liberal middle classes that ideas of national unity following the abolition of aristocratic privileges gained popularity.

Q. 7. How did marginal groups threaten the city of London ? What was the root cause of this problem ? How did the authorities in London try to solve this problem ? ,"Ans.  The Police were worried about the law and order and industrialists wanted an orderly work force. There were professional criminals like cheats, tricksters, pick pockets and petty thieves too in the marginal groups.  Most of the people in the marginal groups were very poor who lived by selling lead stolen from roofs, food from shops, lumps of coal and cloth drying from hedges.  In order to discipline them the authorities counted the number of criminals, watched their activities and investigated their lives. High penalties were imposed and deserving poor people were offered WORK, LIFE AND LEISURE","Employers used many methods to recruit and retain labour. Heavy taxes were imposed which could be paid only by working for wages on plantations and mines. Inheritance laws were changed so that

Q. 8. Why did the concept of ‘Garden City’ come up in London ? Describe the different efforts initiated to beautify London.  Or 		What steps were taken to clean London in the early and mid 20th century ? ,"Ans.  The widespread use of coal in homes and industries in 19th century England raised serious problems. Shopkeepers, home owners and others complained about the black fog, grey skies and black vegetation. All these factors caused bad temper, smoke related illness and dirty clothes. Congestion in the city also led to a yearning for the clean air.  As a result, the demand for new ‘lungs’ for the city was made. Large blocks of apartments were built and rent control was introduced to ease the housing problem.  ‘Garden City’ of New Earswick was designed with common garden spaces and landscaping.  Between the two world wars , the responsibility for housing for the working classes was accepted by the British state and million houses, most of which were single family cottages, were built by local authorities.  The British government built single family cottages for the working classes and the London underground work was started to enable the workers to reach their work places.","As food prices fell, consumption in Britain rose. From the midnineteenth century, faster industrial growth in Britain also led to higher incomes, and therefore more food imports. Around the world – in Eastern Europe, Russia, America and Australia – lands were cleared and food production expanded to meet the British demand.

Q. 9. How did crime grow in London in 1870s ? How were authorities able to control them ? Explain. ,"Ans. Growth of Crime in London :  In London there were 20,000 criminals in 1870s.  In the mid 19th century, Henry Mathew wrote several articles on the London labour and those who made their living from crime.  Many criminals were poor, who lived by stealing lead from roofs, food from shops, coal and also clothes. Control of Crime :  The police were worried about the law and order situation. So population of criminals were counted, their activities were watched and their ways of life were investigated.  In an attempt to discipline the criminals, authorities imposed high penalties for crime and offered work to those who were considered “deserving poor”.","The 1830s were years of great economic hardship in Europe. The first half of the nineteenth century saw an enormous increase in population all over Europe. In most countries there were more seekers of jobs than employment. Population from rural areas migrated to the cities to live in overcrowded slums. Small producers in towns were often faced with stiff competition from imports of cheap machine-made goods from England, where industrialisation was more advanced than on the continent. This was especially so in textile production, which was carried out mainly in homes or small workshops and was only partly mechanised. In those regions of Europe where the aristocracy still enjoyed power, peasants struggled under the burden of feudal dues and obligations. The rise of food prices or a year of bad harvest led to widespread pauperism in town and country. The year 1848 was one such year. Food shortages and widespread unemployment brought the population of Paris out on the roads. Barricades were erected and Louis Philippe was forced to flee. A

Q. 1. What led to the major expansion of Bombay’s population in the mid-nineteenth century ?   Or 		‘A large number of migrants were attracted to Bombay in the 20th century.’ Explain the statement. ,"Ans.  Bombay became the capital city of the Bombay presidency in 1819, hence more people began to settle in Bombay.  Growth of trade in cotton and opium led large communities of traders, bankers, artisans and shopkeepers came to settle in Bombay.  In 1854, cotton mills were established in Bombay. Most of the workers came from outside.  Large number of people came to work at the seaport and the railways which encouraged migration.  Famines in dry regions brought more people to Bombay. Bombay attracted many people to work in films too.","4 Factories Come Up The first cotton mill in Bombay came up in 1854 and it went into production two years later. By 1862 four mills were at work with 94,000 spindles and 2,150 looms. Around the same time jute mills came up in Bengal, the first being set up in 1855 and another one seven years later, in 1862. In north India, the Elgin Mill was started in Kanpur in the 1860s, and a year later the first cotton mill of Ahmedabad was set up. By 1874, the first spinning and weaving mill of Madras began production. Who set up the industries? Where did the capital come from? Who came to work in the mills?
 In most industrial regions workers came from the districts around. Peasants and artisans who found no work in the village went to the industrial centres in search of work. Over 50 per cent workers in the Bombay cotton industries in 1911 came from the neighbouring district of Ratnagiri, while the mills of Kanpur got most of their textile hands from the villages within the district of Kanpur. Most often millworkers moved between the village and the city, returning to their village homes during harvests and festivals. Fig. 19 – Young workers of a Bombay mill, early twentieth century. When workers went back to their village homes, they liked dressing up.

 Getting jobs was always difficult, even when mills multiplied and the demand for workers increased. The numbers seeking work were always more than the jobs available. Entry into the mills was also restricted. Industrialists usually employed a jobber to get new recruits. Very often the jobber was an old and trusted worker. He got people from his village, ensured them jobs, helped them settle in the city and provided them money in times of crisis. The jobber therefore became a person with some authority and power. He began demanding money and gifts for his favour and controlling the lives of workers. The number of factory workers increased over time. However, as you will see, they were a small proportion of the total industrial workforce. Source E Vasant Parkar, who was once a millworker in Bombay, said: ‘The workers would pay the jobbers money to get their sons work in the mill … The mill worker was closely associated with his village, physically and emotionally. He would go home to cut the harvest and for sowing. The Konkani would go home to cut the paddy and the Ghati, the sugarcane. It was an accepted practice for which the mills granted leave.’

Q. 3. Describe the social life of people in . ,"Ans.  The city of Bombay was over crowded. As such, there was an interdependence among people.  The homes were small, so streets and neighbourhood were used for a variety of activities and social functions.  The rich people lived in spacious bungalows.  The working people lived in the thickly-populated Chawls of Bombay.  Shortage of water was a common phenomenon.

Q. 4. Why has city life always attracted those seeking freedom and opportunity ? Explain. ,"Ans.  The city life symbolized freedom from the collective social values which people were compelled to follow in their villages.  There were numerous caste and community rules in the rural set-up which based when people moved to cities.  People became more free and they carried new ways of living.  The public transport system and multistoreyed housing loosened traditional regulations and people learned to live in multiethnic and multicultural environment brought from different places by migrants to the city.  The city symbolized self made people who come here to pursue their dreams.  City culture bought a wave of individualism and were supposed to be quite organised than the rural areas, so people who migrated found it attractive. ","enjoyed a new-found freedom. Businessmen and small-scale producers of goods, in particular, began to realise that uniform laws, standardised weights and measures, and a common national currency would facilitate the movement and exchange of goods and capital from one region to another.

Q. 5. What were ‘Chawls’ ? Describe the living conditions in chawls in Bombay.  Or 		 Describe the life of people who lived in the chawls of Bombay . ,"Ans. Chawls were the multi-storeyed structures built and owned by private landlord such as merchants, bankers and building contractors. Each Chawl is divided into smaller one - room tenements.  No private toilets. Many families could reside at a time in a tenement.  People used to keep windows closed because of the close proximity to filthy putter, buffalo stables etc.  Due to water scarce the people quarrelled every morning for a turn at the tap. Streets and Neighbourhoods areas were used for activities as cooking, washing, sleeping.  Liquor shops and Akharas in empty sports. Streets were used for leisure activities.  Chawls were also a place for exchanging news ","Fig. 10 – Houseless and Hungry, painting by Samuel Luke Fildes, 1874. This painting shows the homeless in London applying for tickets to stay overnight in a workhouse. These shelters were maintained under the supervision of the Poor Law Commissioners for the ‘destitute, wayfarers, wanderers and foundling’. Staying in these workhouses was a humiliating experience: everyone was subjected to a medical examination to see whether they were carrying disease, their bodies were cleansed, and their clothes purified. They had to also do hard labour.

 shelters. Some stayed in Night Refuges that were set up by private individuals; others went to the Casual Wards maintained by the Poor Law authorities. Seasonality of work in many industries meant prolonged periods without work. After the busy season was over, the poor were on the streets again. Some returned to the countryside after the winter, when the demand for labour in the rural areas opened up in places. But most looked for odd jobs, which till the mid-nineteenth century were difficult to find. Wages increased somewhat in the early nineteenth century. But they tell us little about the welfare of the workers. The average figures hide the variations between trades and the fluctuations from year to year. For instance, when prices rose sharply during the prolonged Napoleonic War, the real value of what the workers earned fell significantly, since the same wages could now buy fewer things. Moreover, the income of workers depended not on the wage rate alone. What was also critical was the period of employment: the number of days of work determined the average daily income of the workers. At the best of times till the mid-nineteenth century, about 10 per cent of the urban population were extremely poor. In periods of economic slump, like the 1830s, the proportion of unemployed went up to anything between 35 and 75 per cent in different regions. The fear of unemployment made workers hostile to the introduction of new technology. When the Spinning Jenny was introduced in
 As loans flowed in and the demand for fine textiles expanded, weavers eagerly took the advances, hoping to earn more. Many weavers had small plots of land which they had earlier cultivated along with weaving, and the produce from this took care of their family needs. Now they had to lease out the land and devote all their time to weaving. Weaving, in fact, required the labour of the entire family, with children and women all engaged in different stages of the process. Soon, however, in many weaving villages there were reports of clashes between weavers and gomasthas. Earlier supply merchants had very often lived within the weaving villages, and had a close relationship with the weavers, looking after their needs and helping them in times of crisis. The new gomasthas were outsiders, with no long-term social link with the village. They acted arrogantly, marched into villages with sepoys and peons, and punished weavers for delays in supply – often beating and flogging them. The weavers lost the space to bargain for prices and sell to different buyers: the price they received from the Company was miserably low and the loans they had accepted tied them to the Company.

Q. 6. Explain any four causes of air pollution in Calcutta in 19th century and early 20th century. Which body controlled industrial pollution in Bengal ?  Or 		Calcutta  had a long history of ‘air pollution’. Explain any five reasons for it. ,"Ans. Causes :  Huge population depended on dung and wood as fuel in their daily life.  The industries and establishments that used steam engines were run on coal.  In 1855, the introduction of Railway brought coal from Raniganj which had high content of ash. It also polluted the air.  The fog in the city combined with smoke to create thick smog.  Due to marshy land, the resulting fog combined with smoke to generate thick smog.  Bengal Smoke Nuisance Commission controlled industrial pollution in Bengal. ","the woollen industry, women who survived on hand spinning began attacking the new machines. This conflict over the introduction of the jenny continued for a long time. After the 1840s, building activity intensified in the cities, opening up greater opportunities of employment. Roads were widened, new railway stations came up, railway lines were extended, tunnels dug, drainage and sewers laid, rivers embanked. The number of workers employed in the transport industry doubled in the 1840s, and doubled again in the subsequent 30 years.

Q. 7. Why were reclamation projects undertaken in Bombay ? Explain any two such projects.  Or Why was the land reclamation in Bombay necessary ? Mention any two land reclamation projects taken up in Bombay. ,"Ans. The Reclamation in Bombay was necessary because :  When the islands of Bombay passed into British hands, the East India Company shifted its base from Surat to Bombay. Thus, Bombay became a major outlet for exports and it also became an important administration centre in Western India and by the end of the 19th century a major industrial centre.  With the growth of trade in cotton and opium large communities of trades and banks as well as artisans and shopkeepers came to settle in Bombay.  Bombay dominated the maritime trade of India till well into the twentieth century.  The railways encouraged an even higher scale of migration into the city. For instance, famine in dry region of Kutch drove large numbers of people into Bombay in 1888-89.  		Land Reclamation Projects :  Back Bay Reclamation : In 1864, the Back Bay Reclamation Company won the right to reclaim the western foreshore from the tip of Malabar hill to the end of Colaba.  Bombay Port Trust : A successful Reclamation project was undertaken by the Bombay Port Trust, which built a dry between 1914 and 1918 used the excavated earth to create the 22 acre Ballard Estate. Subsequently the famous Marine Drive of Bombay was developed.","Fig. 15 – Bombay harbour, a late-eighteenth-century drawing. Bombay and Calcutta grew as trading ports from the 1780s.

Q. 8. What do you mean by “Land Reclamation”? Explain the history of land reclamation in Mumbai. 				 ,Ans. Reclamation means reclaiming of marshy or submerged areas for settlement or other use.  William Hornby approved the building of great sea wall.  Several plans by both government and private companies.  In 1864 the Back Bay Reclamation Company won the right to reclaim foreshore from Malabar Hill to Calaba.  Bombay Port Trust created 22 acre Ballard,"Some of this dramatic change, though on a smaller scale, occurred closer home in west Punjab. Here the British Indian government built a network of irrigation canals to transform semi-desert wastes into fertile agricultural lands that could grow wheat and cotton for export. The Canal Colonies, as the areas irrigated by the new canals were called, were settled by peasants from other parts of Punjab.

Q. 9. “Bombay is a city of slums and star bungalows —a blend of dream and reality.” Justify the statement giving any five suitable arguments. ,"Ans.  Bombay films have contributed in a big way to produce an image of the city as a blend of dream and reality.  Rich industrialists and film producers owned spacious bungalows.  Bombay offered employment to both skilled and unskilled workers.  With the rapid and unplanned expansion of the city, the pressure on Bombay’s housing problem increased.  Refuge and waste products of large factories led to pollution.   The history of print in Europe.  The growth of press in 19th century India.

In the 11th century, Chinese paper reached Europe via the silk route. Johann Gutenberg invented the olive printing press which provided the model for the printing press. With the printing press, a new reading public emerged in the world. Through the 17th & 18th centuries, literacy rates went up in various parts of Europe. In England, penny chap books were carried, by petty peddlers known as chapmen sold for a penny. In France, were the 'Biliotheque Blue', which were low priced small books printed on poor quality paper. The discoveries of Isaac Newton and the writings of thinkers such as Thomas Paine, Voltaire and Jean Jacques Rousseau were widely printed and read. Print created a new culture of dialogue and debate. Through the 19th century, there were a series of further innovations in printing technology. India had a very rich and old tradition of handwritten manuscripts in different languages. Manuscripts were copied on palm leaves or on handmade paper. The first printing press came to Goa  with Portuguese missionaries in the mid 16th century. After the Revolt of 1857, the attitude to freedom of the press changed. Eraged Englishmen demanded a clamp down on the 'native' press. In 1878, the Vernacular Press Act was passed , modelled on the Irish Press Laws. This act provided the government with extensive right to censor report and editorials. Public libraries were set up from the early 20th century, expanding the access to books. Social reformers like Jyotiba Phule wrote about the injustices of caste system in his book Gulamgiri.","Print Culture and the Modern World
 P r i n t Print C u Culture lture and the Modern World
 It is difficult for us to imagine a world without printed matter. We find evidence of print everywhere around us – in books, journals, newspapers, prints of famous paintings, and also in everyday things like theatre programmes, official circulars, calendars, diaries, advertisements, cinema posters at street corners. We read printed literature, see printed images, follow the news through newspapers, and track public debates that appear in print. We take for granted this world of print and often forget that there was a time before print. We may not realise that print itself has a history which has, in fact, shaped our contemporary world. What is this history? When did printed literature begin to circulate? How has it helped create the modern world? In this chapter we will look at the development of print, from its beginnings in East Asia to its expansion in Europe and in India. We will understand the impact of the spread of technology and consider how social lives and cultures changed with the coming of print.
 a) Woodblock print only came to Europe after 1295. b) Martin Luther was in favour of print and spoke out in praise of it. c) The Roman Catholic Church began keeping an Index of Prohibited books from the mid-sixteenth century. d) Gandhi said the fight for Swaraj is a fight for liberty of speech, liberty of the press, and freedom of association. 2.

"Q. 1. Explain any five factors that led to the Great Depression of 1929.  Or 		What do you know about Great Depression ? Write any two causes of it.  				 [Board Term 1, 2011, , 2010 ]","Ans. Great depression began around 1929 and lasted till the mid 1930s. During this period, most parts of the world experienced decline in production, employment, incomes and trade. Agricultural regions and communities were the most affected. Causes of Great Depression :  Post-world war economy of the world was fragile. Agricultural over production was a problem. As prices slumped, farm produce rotted.  Many countries financed loans from the U.S.  U.S. overseas lenders panicked at the sign of financial crisis.  Thus, banks were bankrupt and were forced to close down in Europe and in the US because they were unable to recover investments, collect loans and repay depositors.  American capitalists stopped all loans.","3.4 The Great Depression
 The depression was caused by a combination of several factors. We have already seen how fragile the post-war world economy was. First: agricultural overproduction remained a problem. This was made worse by falling agricultural prices. As prices slumped and agricultural incomes declined, farmers tried to expand production and bring a larger volume of produce to the market to maintain their overall income. This worsened the glut in the market, pushing down prices even further. Farm produce rotted for a lack of buyers. Second: in the mid-1920s, many countries financed their investments through loans from the US. While it was often extremely easy to raise loans in the US when the going was good, US overseas lenders panicked at the first sign of trouble. In the first half of 1928, US
 The Great Depression began around 1929 and lasted till the mid1930s. During this period most parts of the world experienced catastrophic declines in production, employment, incomes and trade. The exact timing and impact of the depression varied across countries. But in general, agricultural regions and communities were the worst affected. This was because the fall in agricultural prices was greater and more prolonged than that in the prices of industrial goods.
 The US was also the industrial country most severely affected by the depression. With the fall in prices and the prospect of a depression, US banks had also slashed domestic lending and called back loans. Farms could not sell their harvests, households were ruined, and businesses collapsed. Faced with falling incomes, many households in the US could not repay what they had borrowed, and were forced to give up their homes, cars and other consumer durables. The consumerist prosperity of the 1920s now disappeared in a puff of dust. As unemployment soared, people trudged long distances looking for any work they could find. Ultimately, the US banking system itself collapsed. Unable to recover investments, collect loans and repay depositors, thousands of banks went bankrupt and were forced to close. The numbers are phenomenal: by 1933 over 4,000 banks had closed and between 1929 and 1932 about 110, 000 companies had collapsed. By 1935, a modest economic recovery was under way in most industrial countries. But the Great Depression’s wider effects on society, politics and international relations, and on peoples’ minds, proved more enduring.
 3.5 India and the Great Depression If we look at the impact of the depression on India we realise how integrated the global economy had become by the early twentieth century. The tremors of a crisis in one part of the world were quickly relayed to other parts, affecting lives, economies and societies worldwide. In the nineteenth century, as you have seen, colonial India had become an exporter of agricultural goods and importer of manufactures. The depression immediately affected Indian trade.

Q. 2. How did the Great Depression of 1929 affect the Indian trade ? Explain. ,"Ans. Great Depression affected the Indian trade in many ways :  India’s exports and imports were halved between 1928 and 1934.  As international prices crashed, prices in India also plunged.  Peasants and farmers suffered more than urban dwellers.  Peasants producing for the world market were the worst hit.  Town-dwelling land owners and middle-class salaried employees found themselves better off as everything cost less.","The US was also the industrial country most severely affected by the depression.

When an unemployment census showed 10 million people out of work, the local government in many US states began making small allowances to the unemployed. These long queues came to symbolise the poverty and unemployment of the depression years.
 and imports nearly halved between 1928 and 1934. As international prices crashed, prices in India also plunged. Between 1928 and 1934, wheat prices in India fell by 50 per cent. Peasants and farmers suffered more than urban dwellers. Though agricultural prices fell sharply, the colonial government refused to reduce revenue demands. Peasants producing for the world market were the worst hit. Consider the jute producers of Bengal. They grew raw jute that was processed in factories for export in the form of gunny bags. But as gunny exports collapsed, the price of raw jute crashed more than 60 per cent. Peasants who borrowed in the hope of better times or to increase output in the hope of higher incomes faced ever lower prices, and fell deeper and deeper into debt. Thus the Bengal jute growers’ lament: grow more jute, brothers, with the hope of greater cash. Costs and debts of jute will make your hopes get dashed. When you have spent all your money and got the crop off the ground, … traders, sitting at home, will pay only Rs 5 a maund.

Q. 3. Explain the effects of the Great Depression of 1929 on the United States. ,"Ans.

Faced with falling income, many households in the US could not repay what they had borrowed, and were forced to give up their homes, cars and other consumer durables.  Industrial production registered a fall of about 35%.  The number of the unemployed started rising, and in 1933, it touched 17 million. As unemployment soared, people trudged long distances looking for any work they could find. Ultimately, the US banking system itself collapsed.","In 1923, the US resumed exporting capital to the rest of the world and became the largest overseas lender. US imports and capital exports also boosted European recovery and world trade and income growth over the next six years. All this, however, proved too good to last.

 overseas loans amounted to over $ 1 billion. A year later it was one quarter of that amount. Countries that depended crucially on US loans now faced an acute crisis. The withdrawal of US loans affected much of the rest of the world, though in different ways. In Europe it led to the failure of some major banks and the collapse of currencies such as the British pound sterling. In Latin America and elsewhere it intensified the slump in agricultural and raw material prices. The US attempt to protect its economy in the depression by doubling import duties also dealt another severe blow to world trade.

 4.4 End of Bretton Woods and the Beginning of ‘Globalisation’ Despite years of stable and rapid growth, not all was well in this post-war world. From the 1960s the rising costs of its overseas involvements weakened the US’s finances and competitive strength. The US dollar now no longer commanded confidence as the world’s principal currency. It could not maintain its value in relation to gold. This eventually led to the collapse of the system of fixed exchange rates and the introduction of a system of floating exchange rates. From the mid-1970s the international financial system also changed in important ways. Earlier, developing countries could turn to international institutions for loans and development assistance. But now they were forced to borrow from Western commercial banks and private lending institutions. This led to periodic debt crises in the developing world, and lower incomes and increased poverty, especially in Africa and Latin America. The industrial world was also hit by unemployment that began rising from the mid-1970s and remained high until the early 1990s. From the late 1970s MNCs also began to shift production operations to low-wage Asian countries.

In England, the upper classes preferred things produced by hand because they were better finished and especially designed. Machine made goods were exported to colonies. In colonial period, special preference or privileges were given to British goods which were imported in India. British preferred their goods over Indian goods so that their industries could flourish at the cost of the Indian industries. Indian export market and the local market collapsed due to Manchester imports. Many rich Indian businessmen also developed industrial enterprises in India. The first cotton mill in Bombay came up in 1854. Jute mill came up in Bengal in 1855. Some famous industrialists of nineteenth century were Dwarkanath Tagore, Dinshaw Petit, Jamsetjee Nusserwanjee Tata, Seth Hukumchand, etc. As colonial control over Indian trade tightened, it became difficult for the Indian merchants to function with freedom. By the first decade of the 20th century, a series of changes affected the pattern of industrialization. Till the First World War, industrial growth was slow. Large scale industries were mostly located in Bengal and Bombay. zz zz After the war, small-scale industries predominated in India. Handloom cloth production expanded steadily.

Initial History of Textile Industry in India 		http://Karnatakaeducation.org.in","As colonies, many of the less developed regions of the world had been part of Western empires. Now, ironically, as newly independent countries facing urgent pressures to lift their populations out of poverty, they came under the guidance of international agencies dominated by the former colonial powers. Even after many years of decolonisation, the former colonial powers still controlled vital resources such as minerals and land in many of their former colonies. Large corporations of other powerful countries, for example the US, also often managed to secure rights to exploit developing countries’ natural resources very cheaply. At the same time, most developing countries did not benefit from the fast growth the Western economies experienced in the 1950s and 1960s. Therefore they organised themselves as a group – the Group of 77 (or G-77) – to demand a new international economic order (NIEO). By the NIEO they meant a system that would give them real control over their natural resources, more development assistance, fairer prices for raw materials, and better access for their manufactured goods in developed countries’ markets. 76 2020-21

Q. 1. “Trade and cultural exchange always went hand in hand”. Explain the statement in the light of silk route. 			 ,"Ans.  The silk routes are a good example of vibrant pre-modern trade and cultural links between distant parts of the world.  The silk route was used by the Chinese traders to export silk to other countries.  These routes were used by traders to trade goods and exchange culture from one country to another.  Early Christian missionaries almost certainly travelled through this route to Asia, like wise the early Muslim preachers did few centuries later.  These routes were also used to spread religions. Buddhism emerged from Eastern India and spread in several directions through interesting points on the silk routes.","1.1 Silk Routes Link the World The silk routes are a good example of vibrant pre-modern trade and cultural links between distant parts of the world. The name ‘silk routes’ points to the importance of West-bound Chinese silk cargoes along this route. Historians have identified several silk routes, over land and by sea, knitting together vast regions of Asia, and linking Asia with Europe and northern Africa. They are known to have existed since before the Christian Era and thrived almost till the fifteenth century. But Chinese pottery also travelled the same route, as did textiles and spices from India and Southeast Asia. In return, precious metals – gold and silver – flowed from Europe to Asia. Trade and cultural exchange always went hand in hand. Early Christian missionaries almost certainly travelled this route to Asia, as did early Muslim preachers a few centuries later.

Q. 2. Explain the effects of the Great Depression of 1929 on the Indian economy.  Or 		How did the Great Depression of 1929 affect the farmers and the middle classes in India in different ways ? ,"Ans.  India’s exports and imports nearly halved.  As international prices crashed, prices in India also plunged.  Wheat prices in India fell by 50 percent.  Peasants and farmers suffered more than urban dwellers.  The colonial government refused to reduce revenue demands.  India’s peasants indebtedness increased.  They used up their savings and sold jewellery and precious metals. The great depression helped the urban people especially the fixed income earners. ","The US was also the industrial country most severely affected by the depression. With the fall in prices and the prospect of a depression, US banks had also slashed domestic lending and called back loans. Farms could not sell their harvests, households were ruined, and businesses collapsed. Faced with falling incomes, many households in the US could not repay what they had borrowed, and were forced to give up their homes, cars and other consumer durables. The consumerist prosperity of the 1920s now disappeared in a puff of dust. As unemployment soared, people trudged long distances looking for any work they could find. Ultimately, the US banking system itself collapsed. Unable to recover investments, collect loans and repay depositors, thousands of banks went bankrupt and were forced to close. The numbers are phenomenal: by 1933 over 4,000 banks had closed and between 1929 and 1932 about 110, 000 companies had collapsed. By 1935, a modest economic recovery was under way in most industrial countries. But the Great Depression’s wider effects on society, politics and international relations, and on peoples’ minds, proved more enduring.
 3.5 India and the Great Depression If we look at the impact of the depression on India we realise how integrated the global economy had become by the early twentieth century. The tremors of a crisis in one part of the world were quickly relayed to other parts, affecting lives, economies and societies worldwide. In the nineteenth century, as you have seen, colonial India had become an exporter of agricultural goods and importer of manufactures. The depression immediately affected Indian trade.

 and imports nearly halved between 1928 and 1934. As international prices crashed, prices in India also plunged. Between 1928 and 1934, wheat prices in India fell by 50 per cent. Peasants and farmers suffered more than urban dwellers. Though agricultural prices fell sharply, the colonial government refused to reduce revenue demands. Peasants producing for the world market were the worst hit. Consider the jute producers of Bengal. They grew raw jute that was processed in factories for export in the form of gunny bags. But as gunny exports collapsed, the price of raw jute crashed more than 60 per cent. Peasants who borrowed in the hope of better times or to increase output in the hope of higher incomes faced ever lower prices, and fell deeper and deeper into debt. Thus the Bengal jute growers’ lament: grow more jute, brothers, with the hope of greater cash. Costs and debts of jute will make your hopes get dashed. When you have spent all your money and got the crop off the ground, … traders, sitting at home, will pay only Rs 5 a maund.

Q. 3. Explain the three types of movement or flows within international economic exchange. Mention any one example of any one type of flow from India and one from England. ,Ans.  The first movement is the flow of trade of goods.  The second movement is the flow of people migrating in search of employment.  The third movement is the flow of capital in terms of short-term and long-term investments done overseas.  Flow of goods and capital was smoother than the flow of people. All three were benefitted by the exchange of ideas. India : Migration of indentured labourers ; trade of cotton textile . Europe : Selling of Manchester goods in India.,"2 The Nineteenth Century (1815-1914) The world changed profoundly in the nineteenth century. Economic, political, social, cultural and technological factors interacted in complex ways to transform societies and reshape external relations. Economists identify three types of movement or ‘flows’ within international economic exchanges. The first is the flow of trade which in the nineteenth century referred largely to trade in goods (e.g., cloth or wheat). The second is the flow of labour – the migration of people in search of employment. The third is the movement of capital for short-term or long-term investments over long distances. All three flows were closely interwoven and affected peoples’ lives more deeply now than ever before. The interconnections could sometimes be broken – for example, labour migration was often more restricted than goods or capital flows. Yet it helps us understand the nineteenth-century world economy better if we look at the three flows together.

Q. 4. What were the main features of First World War ? ,"Ans.		The main features of the First World War are as follows :  The First World War  was mainly fought in Europe. But its impact was felt around the world.  It was fought between two power blocs —the Allies  and the Central Powers (Germany, Austria - Hungary and Ottoman Turkey).  It lasted more than four years.  It was the first modern industrial war as it saw the use of machine guns, tanks, aircraft, chemical weapons, etc., on a large scale.  To fight the war, millions of soldiers had to be recruited from around the world and most of them were men of working age.  During the war, 9 million people were dead and 20 million were injured.  These death and injuries reduced the able-bodied workforce in Europe.  Industries were restructured to produce warrelated goods.","3 The Inter-war Economy The First World War (1914-18) was mainly fought in Europe. But its impact was felt around the world. Notably for our concerns in this chapter, it plunged the first half of the twentieth century into a crisis that took over three decades to overcome. During this period the world experienced widespread economic and political instability, and another catastrophic war.

 India and the Contemporary World
 The First World War was a war like no other before. The fighting involved the world’s leading industrial nations which now harnessed the vast powers of modern industry to inflict the greatest possible destruction on their enemies. This war was thus the first modern industrial war. It saw the use of machine guns, tanks, aircraft, chemical weapons, etc. on a massive scale. These were all increasingly products of modern largescale industry. To fight the war, millions of soldiers had to be recruited from around the world and moved to the frontlines on large ships and trains. The scale of death and destruction – 9 million dead and 20 million injured – was unthinkable before the industrial age, without the use of industrial arms. Most of the killed and maimed were men of working age. These deaths and injuries reduced the able-bodied workforce in Europe. With fewer numbers within the family, household incomes declined after the war. During the war, industries were restructured to produce war-related goods. Entire societies were also reorganised for war – as men went to battle, women stepped in to undertake jobs that earlier only men were expected to do.

Q. 6. Describe in brief the economic conditions of the post First World War period. ,"Ans. Post First World War period economic conditions:  Britain which was world’s leading economy in the pre-war period faced a prolonged crisis.  Indian and Japanese industries were developed as Britain was occupied with war.  After the war, it was difficult for Britain to recapture its earlier position in the Indian market.  Britain was burdened with huge external debts from the US.  Government reduced bloated war expenditure. This led to huge job loses and unemployment.  Grain prices were fallen step as wheat supply was disrupted during the First World War. ","3.2 Post-war Recovery Post-war economic recovery proved difficult. Britain, which was the world’s leading economy in the pre-war period, in particular faced a prolonged crisis. While Britain was preoccupied with war, industries had developed in India and Japan. After the war Britain found it difficult to recapture its earlier position of dominance in the Indian market, and to compete with Japan internationally. Moreover, to finance war expenditures Britain had borrowed liberally from the US. This meant that at the end of the war Britain was burdened with huge external debts. The war had led to an economic boom, that is, to a large increase in demand, production and employment. When the war boom ended, production contracted and unemployment increased. At the same time the government reduced bloated war expenditures to bring them into line with peacetime revenues. These developments led to huge job losses – in 1921 one in every five British workers was out of work. Indeed, anxiety and uncertainty about work became an enduring part of the post-war scenario. The Making of a Global World
 Many agricultural economies were also in crisis. Consider the case of wheat producers. Before the war, eastern Europe was a major supplier of wheat in the world market. When this supply was disrupted during the war, wheat production in Canada, America and Australia expanded dramatically. But once the war was over, production in eastern Europe revived and created a glut in wheat output. Grain prices fell, rural incomes declined, and farmers fell deeper into debt.

Q. 7. What have the historians described the century indenture as a new system slavery. Explain five reasons. ,"Ans. Indentured labour was described as a new system of slavery because :  Agents tempted the poor people by giving false information about the nature of work, living and working conditions, modes of travel, etc.  Less willing workers were at time forcibly abducted by the agents.  On the plantation, the working conditions were harsh and they had a few legal rights.  They were beaten or imprisoned for not being able to meet tasks that used to be very heavy or for running away from the job.  Normal medical attention was given to them and wages were deducted in case of absence at work or failure to fulfill the task. ","In the nineteenth century, hundreds of thousands of Indian and Chinese labourers went to work on plantations, in mines, and in road and railway construction projects around the world. In India, indentured labourers were hired under contracts which promised return travel to India after they had worked five years on their employer’s plantation.

 The example of indentured labour migration from India also illustrates the two-sided nature of the nineteenth-century world. It was a world of faster economic growth as well as great misery, higher incomes for some and poverty for others, technological advances in some areas and new forms of coercion in others.
 Most Indian indentured workers came from the present-day regions of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, central India and the dry districts of Tamil Nadu. In the mid-nineteenth century these regions experienced many changes – cottage industries declined, land rents rose, lands were cleared for mines and plantations. All this affected the lives of the poor: they failed to pay their rents, became deeply indebted and were forced to migrate in search of work. 63 2020-21
 The testimony of an indentured labourer Extract from the testimony of Ram Narain Tewary, an indentured labourer who spent ten years on Demerara in the early twentieth century. ‘… in spite of my best efforts, I could not properly do the works that were allotted to me ... In a few days I got my hands bruised all over and I could not go to work for a week for which I was prosecuted and sent to jail for 14 days. ... new emigrants find the tasks allotted to them extremely heavy and cannot complete them in a day. ... Deductions are also made from wages if the work is considered to have been done unsatisfactorily. Many people cannot therefore earn their full wages and are punished in various ways. In fact, the labourers have to spend their period of indenture in great trouble …’ Source: Department of Commerce and Industry, Emigration Branch. 1916

Q. 8. Mention the two key lessons learnt from the interwar economic experiences by the economists and politicians after the Second World War. ,"Ans. The two lessons learnt by the economists and politicians during the Second World War were : 		First : An industrial society based on mass production needs mass consumption. For mass consumption, steady income was necessary and for stable income, full employment was necessary. For this, the government has to take step to minimise the fluctuation of price, production and employment. Hence, economic stability could be ensured by the government intervention. 		Second : The goal of full employment could be achieved only if the government controls the flow of goods, capital and labour. ","4.1 Post-war Settlement and the Bretton Woods Institutions Economists and politicians drew two key lessons from inter-war economic experiences. First, an industrial society based on mass production cannot be sustained without mass consumption. But to ensure mass consumption, there was a need for high and stable incomes. Incomes could not be stable if employment was unstable. Thus stable incomes also required steady, full employment. But markets alone could not guarantee full employment. Therefore governments would have to step in to minimise 74 2020-21
 fluctuations of price, output and employment. Economic stability could be ensured only through the intervention of the government. The second lesson related to a country’s economic links with the outside world. The goal of full employment could only be achieved if governments had power to control flows of goods, capital and labour. Thus in brief, the main aim of the post-war international economic system was to preserve economic stability and full employment in the industrial world. Its framework was agreed upon at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held in July 1944 at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire, USA.

Q. 9. What is the meaning of ‘cultural fusion’ ? Give two examples how indentured labour system led to cultural fusion.  Or 		“The indentured labour gave rise to a new culture in the Carribean islands.” Justify this statement with suitable examples. ,"Ans.  Cultural fusion is a phenomenon which emerges when two or more cultures inter-mingle and produce a new culture.  Indentured labourers used to live and work in very harsh conditions. This forced them to seek new avenues of comfort and relaxations. This blended different cultural forms.  Examples : 		  Hosay : In Trinidad, the annual Muharram procession was transformed into a riotous carnival called ‘Hosay’ in which workers of all races and religions joined. 		  Chutney Music : ‘Chutney music’ is another creative contemporary expression of the post indentured experience. 		  Rastafarianism : The protest religion of 'Rastafarianism' is also said to reflect social and cultural links with Indian migrants to the Carribean. ","Nineteenth-century indenture has been described as a ‘new system of slavery’. On arrival at the plantations, labourers found conditions to be different from what they had imagined. Living and working conditions were harsh, and there were few legal rights. But workers discovered their own ways of surviving. Many of them escaped into the wilds, though if caught they faced severe punishment. Others developed new forms of individual and collective selfexpression, blending different cultural forms, old and new. In Trinidad the annual Muharram procession was transformed into a riotous carnival called ‘Hosay’ (for Imam Hussain) in which workers of all races and religions joined. Similarly, the protest religion of Rastafarianism (made famous by the Jamaican reggae star Bob Marley) is also said to reflect social and cultural links with Indian migrants to the Caribbean. ‘Chutney music’, popular in Trinidad and Guyana, is another creative contemporary expression of the post-indenture experience. These forms of cultural fusion are part of the making of the global world, where things from different places get mixed, lose their original characteristics and become something entirely new. Most indentured workers stayed on after their contracts ended, or returned to their new homes after a short spell in India. Consequently, there are large communities of people of Indian descent in these countries. Have you heard of the Nobel Prize-winning writer 64 2020-21

Q. 11. Explain the destruction caused during the Second World War. Mention two crucial influences which shaped post-war reconstruction. ,"Ans.  Unlike earlier wars, most of the deaths took place outside the battlefields.  More civilians than soldiers died from war.  Vast parts of Asia and Europe were devastated.  Cities were destroyed.  There was immense amount of economic devastation. Two crucial influences : First : U.S’s emergence as military power in the western world. Second : Dominance of the Soviet Union.","The war led to the snapping of economic links between some of the world’s largest economic powers which were now fighting each other to pay for them. So Britain borrowed large sums of money from US banks as well as the US public. Thus the war transformed the US from being an international debtor to an international creditor. In other words, at the war’s end, the US and its citizens owned more overseas assets than foreign governments and citizens owned in the US.

Q. 12. How did the use of technology transform food availability in Europe ?  Or 		What was the impact of technology on food availability ? Explain with the help of examples.  				 ,"Ans.  Faster railways, lighter wagons and larger ships helped food to reach more quickly from farms to markets.  Earlier like animals were shipped from America to Europe, many died on the way or became unfit to eat. Thus meat became expensive.  Refrigerated ships : The animals could be slaughtered at the starting point of America, Australia or New Zealand and were brought fresh.  This reduced the shipping cost and lowered prices in Europe.  The poor could add variety to their food and it improved their living condition.","The trade in meat offers a good example of this connected process. Till the 1870s, animals were shipped live from America to Europe and then slaughtered when they arrived there. But live animals took up a lot of ship space. Many also died in voyage, fell ill, lost weight, or became unfit to eat. Meat was hence an expensive luxury beyond the reach of the European poor. High prices in turn kept demand and production down until the development of a new technology, namely, refrigerated ships, which enabled the transport of perishable foods over long distances. Now animals were slaughtered for food at the starting point – in America, Australia or New Zealand – and then transported to Europe as frozen meat. This reduced shipping costs and lowered meat prices in Europe. The poor in Europe could now consume a more varied diet. To the earlier monotony of bread and potatoes many, though not all, could now add meat (and butter and eggs) to their diet. Better living conditions promoted social peace within the country and support for imperialism abroad.
 2.3 Late nineteenth-century Colonialism Trade flourished and markets expanded in the late nineteenth century. But this was not only a period of expanding trade and increased prosperity. It is important to realise that there was a darker side to this process. In many parts of the world, the expansion of trade and a closer relationship with the world economy also meant a loss of freedoms and livelihoods. Latenineteenth-century European conquests produced many painful economic, social and ecological changes through which the colonised societies were brought into the world economy. 60 2020-21

Q. 13. Describe the social and economic effects of the World War on England and USA. ,Ans. Social Effects :  Most ot the killed and maimed people were of the working age and this affected the work force in England.  Household income declined and women stepped in to take up jobs.  Role and position of women changed forever in England. Economic Effects :  Economic links between some of the major economic powers of the world were snapped.  England borrowed large sums of money from US Banks.  USA emerged as an international creditor.  USA owned more assets in foreign countries than foreign countries owned in the USA. ,"The war led to the snapping of economic links between some of the world’s largest economic powers which were now fighting each other to pay for them. So Britain borrowed large sums of money from US banks as well as the US public. Thus the war transformed the US from being an international debtor to an international creditor. In other words, at the war’s end, the US and its citizens owned more overseas assets than foreign governments and citizens owned in the US.
 3.2 Post-war Recovery Post-war economic recovery proved difficult. Britain, which was the world’s leading economy in the pre-war period, in particular faced a prolonged crisis. While Britain was preoccupied with war, industries had developed in India and Japan. After the war Britain found it difficult to recapture its earlier position of dominance in the Indian market, and to compete with Japan internationally. Moreover, to finance war expenditures Britain had borrowed liberally from the US. This meant that at the end of the war Britain was burdened with huge external debts. The war had led to an economic boom, that is, to a large increase in demand, production and employment. When the war boom ended, production contracted and unemployment increased. At the same time the government reduced bloated war expenditures to bring them into line with peacetime revenues. These developments led to huge job losses – in 1921 one in every five British workers was out of work. Indeed, anxiety and uncertainty about work became an enduring part of the post-war scenario.

"Q. 14. What was Rinderpest ? How did it adversely affect the lives and fortunes of the Africans ?  Or 		What was Rinderpest ? How did Rinderpest change the economy of the African Society ? [Board Term 1, 2011 , 2010)] Or 		 Describe briefly the effects of Rinderpest in Africa in the 1890s.","Ans. Rinderpest was the fast spreading and devastating disease of cattle plague. Effects of Rinderpest : It affected the Africans in following ways :  Rinderpest moved like forest fire.  90% of cattle were killed.  The loss of cattle destroyed African livelihoods. Earlier people rarely worked for a wage. They possessed land and livestock. Due to Rinderpest, they were forced to work for wages and so it affected the economy.  Colonial government forced the Africans into labour market.","2.4 Rinderpest, or the Cattle Plague In Africa, in the 1890s, a fast-spreading disease of cattle plague or rinderpest had a terrifying impact on people’s livelihoods and the local economy. This is a good example of the widespread European imperial impact on colonised societies. It shows how in this era of conquest even a disease affecting cattle reshaped the lives and fortunes of thousands of people and their relations with the rest of the world. Historically, Africa had abundant land and a relatively small population. For centuries, land and livestock sustained African livelihoods and people rarely worked for a wage. In latenineteenth-century Africa there were few consumer goods that wages could buy. If you had been an African possessing land and livestock – and there was plenty of both – you too would have seen little reason to work for a wage.

Q. 15. Explain how did the abolition of corn laws in Britain led to the emergence of a global agricultural economy ? ,"Ans.  With scrapping of corn laws, Britain began to import foodgrains from rest of the world. These products were relatively cheaper than the prices of the British produced goods and foodgrains.  Britain was forced to import foodgrains from Eastern Europe, America and Australia.  There were complex changes in labour movement patterns, capital flow, ecology and technology.  Crops was not grown by a peasant tilling his own land but by an agricultural worker.  Food came from thousands of miles away.  Now food and other essential commodities were transported by railways and by ships manned by low paid workers from South Europe, Asia, Africa and Carribean.","Population growth from the late eighteenth century had increased the demand for food grains in Britain. As urban centres expanded and industry grew, the demand for agricultural products went up, pushing up food grain prices. Under pressure from landed groups, the government also restricted the import of corn. The laws allowing the government to do this were commonly known as the ‘Corn Laws’. Unhappy with high food prices, industrialists and urban dwellers forced the abolition of the Corn Laws. After the Corn Laws were scrapped, food could be imported into Britain more cheaply than it could be produced within the country. British agriculture was unable to compete with imports. Vast areas of land were now left uncultivated, and thousands of men and women were thrown out of work. They flocked to the cities or migrated overseas. 57 2020-21
 As food prices fell, consumption in Britain rose. From the midnineteenth century, faster industrial growth in Britain also led to higher incomes, and therefore more food imports. Around the world – in Eastern Europe, Russia, America and Australia – lands were cleared and food production expanded to meet the British demand. It was not enough merely to clear lands for agriculture. Railways were needed to link the agricultural regions to the ports. New harbours had to be built and old ones expanded to ship the new cargoes. People had to settle on the lands to bring them under cultivation. This meant building homes and settlements. All these activities in turn required capital and labour. Capital flowed from financial centres such as London. The demand for labour in places where labour was in short supply – as in America and Australia – led to more migration.
 Thus by 1890, a global agricultural economy had taken shape, accompanied by complex changes in labour movement patterns, capital flows, ecologies and technology. Food no longer came from a nearby village or town, but from thousands of miles away. It was not grown by a peasant tilling his own land, but by an agricultural worker, perhaps recently arrived, who was now working on a large farm that only a generation ago had most likely been a forest. It was transported by railway, built for that very purpose, and by ships which were increasingly manned in these decades by low-paid workers from southern Europe, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.
 Activity Prepare a flow chart to show how Britain’s decision to import food led to increased migration to America and Australia.

Q. 16. Explain why economy of USA was strong in the early 1920s ? Would you agree that the roots of the Great Depression lay in the ‘boom’ ? Give reasons for your answer. ,"Ans.  Mass production became a characteristic feature of industrial production in the USA.  Mass production lowered costs and prices of engineered goods.  There was a spurt in the purchase of refrigerators, washing machines, etc., through hire purchase.  It was fuelled by a boom in house construction and home ownership, financed once again by loans. Yes, the roots of the Great Depression lies in this boom because of the overproduction in industrial and agricultural sector.","credit repaid in weekly or monthly instalments). The demand for refrigerators, washing machines, etc. was also fuelled by a boom in house construction and home ownership, financed once again by loans. The housing and consumer boom of the 1920s created the basis of prosperity in the US. Large investments in housing and household goods seemed to create a cycle of higher employment and incomes, rising consumption demand, more investment, and yet more employment and incomes.

 In 1923, the US resumed exporting capital to the rest of the world and became the largest overseas lender. US imports and capital exports also boosted European recovery and world trade and income growth over the next six years. All this, however, proved too good to last. By 1929 the world would be plunged into a depression such as it had never experienced before.

 3.4 The Great Depression
 The depression was caused by a combination of several factors. We have already seen how fragile the post-war world economy was. First: agricultural overproduction remained a problem. This was made worse by falling agricultural prices. As prices slumped and agricultural incomes declined, farmers tried to expand production and bring a larger volume of produce to the market to maintain their overall income. This worsened the glut in the market, pushing down prices even further. Farm produce rotted for a lack of buyers. Second: in the mid-1920s, many countries financed their investments through loans from the US. While it was often extremely easy to raise loans in the US when the going was good, US overseas lenders panicked at the first sign of trouble. In the first half of 1928, US

Q. 18. Define the term “Trade Surplus”. How was the income received from trade surplus with India used by Britain ? ,"Ans. Trade Surplus : It is a situation in which the total      value of export of a nation during the year exceeds the total value of imports. Over the 19th century, British manufacturers flooded Indian market. Foodgrains and raw material exports from India and Britain and world were also increased. Value of British exports to India were higher than imports from India. Britain, as such had “Trade surplus” with India. Britain used this surplus to balance trade deficit with other countries. This is how a multilateral settlement system works that allows one country’s deficit with another country to be settled by its surplus with a third country. India played a crucial role in helping Britain to balance its deficits. Britain’s trade surplus in India helped paying the home charges that included private remittances home by British officials and traders.","many decades. And, as you have read last year, opium shipments to China grew rapidly from the 1820s to become for a while India’s single largest export. Britain grew opium in India and exported it to China and, with the money earned through this sale, it financed its tea and other imports from China. Over the nineteenth century, British manufactures flooded the Indian market. Food grain and raw material exports from India to Britain and the rest of the world increased. But the value of British exports to India was much higher than the value of British imports from India. Thus Britain had a ‘trade surplus’ with India. Britain used this surplus to balance its trade deficits with other countries – that is, with countries from which Britain was importing more than it was selling to. This is how a multilateral settlement system works – it allows one country’s deficit with another country to be settled by its surplus with a third country. By helping Britain balance its deficits, India played a crucial role in the late-nineteenth-century world economy.

"Q. 1. Describe the techniques which were adopted by the Manchester industrialists to sell their goods in India.  Or Explain with examples the importance of advertisement in the marketing of goods.  Or 		How did the Indian and British merchants and manufacturers advertise their products in India to promote their sale ?  Or 		Describe any five methods adopted by the British manufacturers to take over the Indian market in the beginning of 20th century.  Or 		Analyse the different modes of advertisement used by the producers to popularize their products and promote sale in the 19th century India.  Or 		“From the very beginning of the industrial age, advertisements have played an important role in expanding the markets for products and in shaping a new consumer culture.” Explain the statement citing suitable examples.  Or 		How did the British manufacturers attempt to take over Indian market with the help of advertisement ?  Or 		What measures were adopted by the producers in India to expand the market for their goods in the 19th century ? ","Ans.  The Manchester made cloth carried a label with ‘Made in Manchester’ written in bold. This assured the buyers of the quality of the cloth.  The British manufacturers used images of Indian Gods and Goddesses on the labels. It symbolized the divine approval for the commodity. It also created familiarity with the Indian buyers.  Manufacturers got calendars printed with the images of Gods and the advertisement of their products. The calendars were seen on the walls of hotels, tea shops, households, etc. These are used even by people who could not read.  Images of historical characters and heroes from the past were also displayed on calendars thus sending the message that the product was as worthy of respect as were these respectable characters. 5 marks each  The Indian manufacturers printed the image of Bharat Mata and a nationalist message on the labels. They also printed ‘Made in India’ on the labels thus appealing to the nationalist sentiments. Most of the baby products carried the image of Lord Krishna to appeal to the religious sentiments.","When Manchester industrialists began selling cloth in India, they put labels on the cloth bundles. The label was needed to make the place of manufacture and the name of the company familiar to the buyer. The label was also to be a mark of quality. When buyers saw ‘MADE IN MANCHESTER’ written in bold on the label, they were expected to feel confident about buying the cloth.

 Fig. 26(a) – Manchester labels, early twentieth century. Images of numerous Indian gods and goddesses – Kartika, Lakshmi, Saraswati – are shown in imported cloth labels approving the quality of the product being marketed. Fig. 26(b) – Maharaja Ranjit Singh on a Manchester label. Historic figures are used to create respect for the product. Fig. 26(a)
 But labels did not only carry words and texts. They also carried images and were very often beautifully illustrated. If we look at these old labels, we can have some idea of the mind of the manufacturers, their calculations, and the way they appealed to the people. Images of Indian gods and goddesses regularly appeared on these labels. It was as if the association with gods gave divine approval to the goods being sold. The imprinted image of Krishna or Saraswati was also intended to make the manufacture from a foreign land appear somewhat familiar to Indian people. By the late nineteenth century, manufacturers were printing calendars to popularise their products. Unlike newspapers and magazines, calendars were used even by people who could not read. They were hung in tea shops and in poor people’s homes just as much as in offices and middle-class apartments. And those who hung the calendars had to see the advertisements, day after day, through the year. In these calendars, once again, we see the figures of gods being used to sell new products. Like the images of gods, figures of important personages, of emperors and nawabs, adorned advertisement and calendars. The message very often seemed to say: if you respect the royal figure, then respect this product; when the product was being used by kings, or produced under royal command, its quality could not be questioned.
 When Indian manufacturers advertised the nationalist message was clear and loud. If you care for the nation then buy products that Indians produce. Advertisements became a vehicle of the nationalist message of swadeshi.
 Conclusion Clearly, the age of industries has meant major technological changes, growth of factories, and the making of a new industrial labour force. However, as you have seen, hand technology and small-scale production remained an important part of the industrial landscape. Look again at Figs. 1 and 2. What would you now say of the images they project?

The First World War created a dramatically new situations. Till then industrial production had been slow.  British mills were busy with war production and so their imports into India declined.  Indian mills now had a vast home market for supply.  As the war prolonged, Indian factories were called upon to supply war needs, jute bags, cloth for army uniforms, tents, leather boots, horse and mule saddlers and many other items.  Many workers were employed as new factories were set up and old ones ran in multiple shifts.  Over the war years, industrial production boomed. Manchester would not able to capture its old position in the Indian market after the war. Cotton production collapsed and export of cotton cloth from Britain fell. ","Civil War broke out and cotton supplies from the US were cut off, Britain turned to India. As raw cotton exports from India increased, the price of raw cotton shot up. Weavers in India were starved of supplies and forced to buy raw cotton at exorbitant prices. In this, situation weaving could not pay.

Q. 3. Why were there frequent clashes between Gomasthas and weavers in the villages ? Explain five reasons. ,"Ans. There were frequent clashes between Gomasthas and weavers in the villages because of the following reasons :  Earlier supply merchants often belonged to the same villages and had a close relationship with the weavers.  The company’s appointed Gomasthas were outsiders, with no long-term social link with the villagers.  They acted arrogantly, marched into villages with sepoys and peons and punished weavers for delays.  The weavers could no longer bargain for prices or sell to other buyers in place of the British who paid them low wages.  In many places, Carnatic  and Bengal weavers deserted villages, migrated or revolted along with the village traders.","Portuguese as well as the local traders competed in the market to secure woven cloth. So the weaver and supply merchants could bargain and try selling the produce to the best buyer. In their letters back to London, Company officials continuously complained of difficulties of supply and the high prices. However, once the East India Company established political power, it could assert a monopoly right to trade. It proceeded to develop a system of management and control that would eliminate competition, control costs, and ensure regular supplies of cotton and silk goods. This it did through a series of steps. First: the Company tried to eliminate the existing traders and brokers connected with the cloth trade, and establish a more direct control over the weaver. It appointed a paid servant called the gomastha to supervise weavers, collect supplies, and examine the quality of cloth.
 As loans flowed in and the demand for fine textiles expanded, weavers eagerly took the advances, hoping to earn more. Many weavers had small plots of land which they had earlier cultivated along with weaving, and the produce from this took care of their family needs. Now they had to lease out the land and devote all their time to weaving. Weaving, in fact, required the labour of the entire family, with children and women all engaged in different stages of the process. Soon, however, in many weaving villages there were reports of clashes between weavers and gomasthas. Earlier supply merchants had very often lived within the weaving villages, and had a close relationship with the weavers, looking after their needs and helping them in times of crisis. The new gomasthas were outsiders, with no long-term social link with the village. They acted arrogantly, marched into villages with sepoys and peons, and punished weavers for delays in supply – often beating and flogging them. The weavers lost the space to bargain for prices and sell to different buyers: the price they received from the Company was miserably low and the loans they had accepted tied them to the Company.

 Second: it prevented Company weavers from dealing with other buyers. One way of doing this was through the system of advances. Once an order was placed, the weavers were given loans to purchase the raw material for their production. Those who took loans had to hand over the cloth they produced to the gomastha. They could not take it to any other trader.
 In many places in Carnatic and Bengal, weavers deserted villages and migrated, setting up looms in other villages where they had some family relation. Elsewhere, weavers along with the village traders revolted, opposing the Company and its officials. Over time many weavers began refusing loans, closing down their workshops and taking to agricultural labour. By the turn of the nineteenth century, cotton weavers faced a new set of problems.

Q. 4. Why was a jobber employed ? How did a jobber misuse his position and power ? Explain. ,"Ans. Jobber was employed to get new recruits for the factories or industrialists. 		 The jobber misused his position and power in the following ways :  Initially jobbers cured people from his village ensuring them jobs. He also helped them settle in the city and lent them money in the time of crisis.  Gradually, jobbers got position and power.  They started demanding money and gifts for all the favours.  They also started to control the lives of the workers.  Jobbers got people from his own village and restricted entries of others in the mills.","Getting jobs was always difficult, even when mills multiplied and the demand for workers increased. The numbers seeking work were always more than the jobs available. Entry into the mills was also restricted. Industrialists usually employed a jobber to get new recruits. Very often the jobber was an old and trusted worker. He got people from his village, ensured them jobs, helped them settle in the city and provided them money in times of crisis. The jobber therefore became a person with some authority and power. He began demanding money and gifts for his favour and controlling the lives of workers. The number of factory workers increased over time. However, as you will see, they were a small proportion of the total industrial workforce. Source E Vasant Parkar, who was once a millworker in Bombay, said: ‘The workers would pay the jobbers money to get their sons work in the mill … The mill worker was closely associated with his village, physically and emotionally. He would go home to cut the harvest and for sowing. The Konkani would go home to cut the paddy and the Ghati, the sugarcane. It was an accepted practice for which the mills granted leave.’

Q. 5. What steps were taken by the East India Company to control the market of cotton and silk goods ? What was its impact ?  Or 		How did the East India Company procure regular supplies of cotton and silk textiles from Indian weavers ?,Ans.  The East India Company tried to eliminate the existing traders and appointed 'Gomasthas' as supervisors.  The system of advances was introduced to have a direct control over the weavers. Impact :  Weavers devoted entire time to weaving.  They were forced to accept the prices fixed by the company.  There were reports of clashes of weavers with gomasthas.,"3.2 What Happened to Weavers? The consolidation of East India Company power after the 1760s did not initially lead to a decline in textile exports from India. British cotton industries had not yet expanded and Indian fine textiles were in great demand in Europe. So the company was keen on expanding textile exports from India. Before establishing political power in Bengal and Carnatic in the 1760s and 1770s, the East India Company had found it difficult to ensure a regular supply of goods for export.

Q. 6. How did the Indian industries develop in the 19th and 20th centuries ? Explain. ,"Ans.  The early industrialists avoided a direct competition with British factories.  The cotton mills started to produce coarse cotton yarn and this was exported to China.  As Swadeshi Movement gathered momentum, industrialist pressurised government to increase tariff protection.  Exports to China declined and domestic markets were taken over by China.  During the First World War, British government called upon the Indian mills to produce goods such as jute bags, boots, etc., for British Army.  As the war prolonged, England could not capture the Indian markets. ","European Managing Agencies, which dominated industrial production in India, were interested in certain kinds of products. They established tea and coffee plantations, acquiring land at cheap rates from the colonial government; and they invested in mining, indigo and jute. Most of these were products required primarily for export trade and not for sale in India. When Indian businessmen began setting up industries in the late nineteenth century, they avoided competing with Manchester goods in the Indian market. Since yarn was not an important part of British imports into India, the early cotton mills in India produced coarse cotton yarn (thread) rather than fabric. When yarn was imported it was only of the superior variety. The yarn produced in Indian spinning mills was used by handloom weavers in India or exported to China.
 Yet, till the First World War, industrial growth was slow. The war created a dramatically new situation. With British mills busy with war production to meet the needs of the army, Manchester imports into India declined. Suddenly, Indian mills had a vast home market to supply.

 The Age of Industrialisation
 By the first decade of the twentieth century a series of changes affected the pattern of industrialisation. As the swadeshi movement gathered momentum, nationalists mobilised people to boycott foreign cloth. Industrial groups organised themselves to protect their collective interests, pressurising the government to increase tariff protection and grant other concessions. From 1906, moreover, the export of Indian yarn to China declined since produce from Chinese and Japanese mills flooded the Chinese market. So industrialists in India began shifting from yarn to cloth production. Cotton piecegoods production in India doubled between 1900 and 1912.

It developed a system that would eliminate competition, control cost and ensure regular supply of cotton and silk goods. These measures ultimately led to the ruination of Indian weavers. The measures adopted were as follows :  The company tried to eliminate the existing traders and brokers connected with cloth trade and establish a direct control over the weavers. It appointed a paid servant called Gomastha to supervise the weavers, collect supplies and examine the quality of cloth.  The company weavers were prevented from selling to other buyers. The weavers were tied to the company by a system of advances. Loans were given to the weavers for production and they had to handover the finished products to the Gomasthas. The price that the weavers received was low, but they had no choice but to sell their goods to the British because the loans tied them to the British. This was a situation of helplessness and desperation made them to revolt against the British. They quit their profession and migrate to other places. ","3.2 What Happened to Weavers? The consolidation of East India Company power after the 1760s did not initially lead to a decline in textile exports from India. British cotton industries had not yet expanded and Indian fine textiles were in great demand in Europe. So the company was keen on expanding textile exports from India. Before establishing political power in Bengal and Carnatic in the 1760s and 1770s, the East India Company had found it difficult to ensure a regular supply of goods for export.

 Portuguese as well as the local traders competed in the market to secure woven cloth. So the weaver and supply merchants could bargain and try selling the produce to the best buyer. In their letters back to London, Company officials continuously complained of difficulties of supply and the high prices. However, once the East India Company established political power, it could assert a monopoly right to trade. It proceeded to develop a system of management and control that would eliminate competition, control costs, and ensure regular supplies of cotton and silk goods. This it did through a series of steps. First: the Company tried to eliminate the existing traders and brokers connected with the cloth trade, and establish a more direct control over the weaver.

Or 		Explain any five factors responsible for the decline of the cotton textile industry in India in mid-nineteenth century.  Or 		Why did the handloom industry collapse in India during the 19th century ? Explain. ","Ans.  Factories in Manchester started producing cotton textiles for the domestic market.  The government put more import duties on the textile coming from India to encourage the local industries. As a result, the Indian weavers lost their overseas market.  Eventually, the Manchester goods started flooding the Indian markets also and it became difficult for the Indian weavers to compete with the low cost Manchester cloth.  The British government in India also levied more taxes on the handloom units which made the Indian textiles costlier in Indian markets when compared to the Manchester textiles.  The Civil War in USA forced the British to buy more raw cotton from India for their Manchester textile industries. This created an acute shortage of raw material for the weavers and the Indian handloom industry collapsed.","3.3 Manchester Comes to India In 1772, Henry Patullo, a Company official, had ventured to say that the demand for Indian textiles could never reduce, since no other nation produced goods of the same quality. Yet by the beginning of the nineteenth century we see the beginning of a long decline of textile exports from India. In 1811-12 piece-goods accounted for 33 per cent of India’s exports; by 1850-51 it was no more than 3 per cent.
 India and the Contemporary World
 Why did this happen? What were its implications? As cotton industries developed in England, industrial groups began worrying about imports from other countries. They pressurised the government to impose import duties on cotton textiles so that Manchester goods could sell in Britain without facing any competition from outside. At the same time industrialists persuaded the East India Company to sell British manufactures in Indian markets as well. Exports of British cotton goods increased dramatically in the early nineteenth century. At the end of the eighteenth century there had been virtually no import of cotton piece-goods into India. But by 1850 cotton piece-goods constituted over 31 per cent of the value of Indian imports; and by the 1870s this figure was over 50 per cent. Cotton weavers in India thus faced two problems at the same time: their export market collapsed, and the local market shrank, being glutted with Manchester imports. Produced by machines at lower costs, the imported cotton goods were so cheap that weavers could not easily compete with them. By the 1850s, reports from most weaving regions of India narrated stories of decline and desolation. By the 1860s, weavers faced a new problem. They could not get sufficient supply of raw cotton of good quality. When the American 92 2020-21

 Print and popular religious literature stimulated many distinctive individual interpretations of faith even among little-educated working people. In the sixteenth century, Menocchio, a miller in Italy, began to read books that were available in his locality. He reinterpreted the message of the Bible and formulated a view of God and Creation that enraged the Roman Catholic Church. When the Roman Church began its inquisition to repress heretical ideas, Menocchio was hauled up twice and ultimately executed. The Roman Church, troubled by such effects of popular readings and questionings of faith, imposed severe controls over publishers and booksellers and began to maintain an Index of Prohibited Books from 1558.

Print was no longer used just by scholar-officials.  Merchants used print in their everyday life, as they collected trade information.  The new readership preferred fictional narratives, poetry, autobiographies, anthologies of literary masterpieces and romantic plays.  Rich women began to read and many women began publishing their poetry and plays.  Wives of scholar-officials published their works and courtsmen wrote about their lives.","1 The First Printed Books The earliest kind of print technology was developed in China, Japan and Korea. This was a system of hand printing. From AD 594 onwards, books in China were printed by rubbing paper – also invented there – against the inked surface of woodblocks. As both sides of the thin, porous sheet could not be printed, the traditional Chinese ‘accordion book’ was folded and stitched at the side. Superbly skilled craftsmen could duplicate, with remarkable accuracy, the beauty of calligraphy.

Print popularized the ideas of enlightened thinkers on traditions, superstitions and despotism.  They advocated reasons.  People read books of Voltaire and Rousseau. Print created dialogue and debate.  People started discussion and evaluated the royalty.  Print literature mocked the royalty.  These kind of print literature circulated underground and it created awareness among people and formed the basis of French Revolution.","First: print popularised the ideas of the Enlightenment thinkers. Collectively, their writings provided a critical commentary on tradition, superstition and despotism. They argued for the rule of reason rather than custom, and demanded that everything be judged through the application of reason and rationality. They attacked the sacred authority of the Church and the despotic power of the state, thus eroding the legitimacy of a social order based on tradition. The writings of Voltaire and Rousseau were read widely; and those who read these books saw the world through new eyes, eyes that were questioning, critical and rational. Second: print created a new culture of dialogue and debate. All values, norms and institutions were re-evaluated and discussed by a public that had become aware of the power of reason, and recognised the need to question existing ideas and beliefs.

Q. 7. Describe any five strategies developed by the printers and publishers in the 19th century to sell their products. ,"Ans.		Some of the important strategies adopted by the printers and publishers to sell books are :  They bring out Serialized novels. The first serialized novel was shilling series. It was a cheap series that was very popular and was sold in England in 1920’s.  The advertisers put up advertisements at strategic public locations such as building, railway station, etc. to attract buyers and improve sales.

Dickens spoke about the exploitation of children/ orphans in ‘Oliver Twist’.  Thomas Hardy highilighted the advantages and disadvantages of the new order.  Thomas Hardy used Vernacular language spoken,"Fourth: technological changes occurred slowly. They did not spread dramatically across the industrial landscape. New technology was expensive and merchants and industrialists were cautious about using it. The machines often broke down and repair was costly. They were not as effective as their inventors and manufacturers claimed. Consider the case of the steam engine. James Watt improved the steam engine produced by Newcomen and patented the new engine in 1781. His industrialist friend Mathew Boulton manufactured the new model. But for years he could find no buyers. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, there were no more than 321 steam engines all over England. Of these, 80 were in cotton industries, nine in wool industries, and the rest in mining, canal works and iron works. Steam engines were not used in any of the other industries till much later in the century. So even the most powerful new technology that enhanced the productivity of labour manifold was slow to be accepted by industrialists. Historians now have come to increasingly recognise that the typical worker in the mid-nineteenth century was not a machine operator but the traditional craftsperson and labourer.

Public libraries were set up from the early twentieth century, expanding the access to books. These libraries were located mostly in cities and towns, and at times in prosperous villages. For rich local patrons, setting up a library was a way of acquiring prestige. From the late nineteenth century, issues of caste discrimination began to be written about in many printed tracts and essays. Jyotiba Phule, the Maratha pioneer of ‘low caste’ protest movements, wrote about the injustices of the caste system in his Gulamgiri (1871). In the twentieth century, B.R. Ambedkar in Maharashtra and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker in Madras, better known as Periyar, wrote powerfully on caste and their writings were read by people all over India. Local protest movements and sects also created a lot of popular journals and tracts criticising ancient scriptures and envisioning a new and just future. Workers in factories were too overworked and lacked the education to write much about their experiences. But Kashibaba, a Kanpur millworker, wrote and published Chhote Aur Bade Ka Sawal in 1938 to show the links between caste and class exploitation. The poems of another Kanpur millworker, who wrote under the name of Sudarshan Chakr between 1935 and 1955, were brought together and published in a collection called Sacchi Kavitayan. By the 1930s, Bangalore cotton millworkers set up libraries to educate themselves, following the example of Bombay workers. These were sponsored by social reformers who tried to restrict excessive drinking among them, to bring literacy and, sometimes, to propagate the message of nationalism. 126 2020-21

Many believed that books could change the world, liberate society from despotism and tyranny, and herald a time when reason and intellect would rule. Louise-Sebastien Mercier, a novelist in eighteenth-century France, declared: ‘The printing press is the most powerful engine of progress and public opinion is the force that will sweep despotism away.’ In many of Mercier’s novels, the heroes are transformed by acts of reading.

Q. 1. “Indian novelists in the 19th century wrote for a national cause.” Justify the statement with examples.  Or 		How did novels in India attempt to create a sense of Pan-Indian belonging ?

They imagined the nation to be full of adventure, heroism, romance and sacrifice.  Bhudeb Mukhopadhyay’s Anguriya Binimoy  was the first historical novel written in Bengal whose hero Shivaji engaged in many battles against a clever and treacherous Aurangzeb.  The imagined nation of the novel was so powerful that it could inspire actual political movements.

Conservative Hindus believed that a literate girl would be widowed and Muslims feared that educated women would be corrupted by reading Urdu romances. Sometimes, rebel women defied such prohibition. We know the story of a girl in a conservative Muslim family of north India who secretly learnt to read and write in Urdu. Her family wanted her to read only the Arabic Quran which she did not understand. So she insisted on learning to read a language that was her own. In East Bengal, in the early nineteenth century, Rashsundari Debi, a young married girl in a very orthodox household, learnt to read in the secrecy of her kitchen. Later, she wrote her autobiography Amar Jiban which was published in 1876. It was the first full-length autobiography published in the Bengali language.

The natives sit on either side of him, servile and submissive. The Indians are being shown a copy of Punch, the British journal of cartoons and satire. You can almost hear the British master say – ‘This is the model, produce Indian versions of it.’
 Since social reforms and novels had already created a great interest in women’s lives and emotions, there was also an interest in what women would have to say about their own lives.

Q. 3. What reasons led to the writing of ‘Indulekha’ by Chandu Menon. ,"Ans.  ‘Indulekha’ was concerned the marriage practices of upper caste Hindus in Kerala, especially the Nambuthiri Brahmins and the Nayars.  Nambuthiris were also major landlords in Kerala at that time; and a large section of the Nayars were their tenants.  In late-19th century Kerala, a younger generation of English-educated Nayar men who had acquired property and wealth on their own, began arguing strongly against Nambuthiri alliances with Nayar women.  They wanted new laws regarding marriage and property.  The story of Indulekha is interesting in the light of their debates.  Chandu Menon clearly wanted his readers to appreciate the new values and criticise the ignorance and immorality.","Nineteenth-century indenture has been described as a ‘new system of slavery’. On arrival at the plantations, labourers found conditions to be different from what they had imagined. Living and working conditions were harsh, and there were few legal rights. But workers discovered their own ways of surviving. Many of them escaped into the wilds, though if caught they faced severe punishment. Others developed new forms of individual and collective selfexpression, blending different cultural forms, old and new. In Trinidad the annual Muharram procession was transformed into a riotous carnival called ‘Hosay’ (for Imam Hussain) in which workers of all races and religions joined. Similarly, the protest religion of Rastafarianism (made famous by the Jamaican reggae star Bob Marley) is also said to reflect social and cultural links with Indian migrants to the Caribbean. ‘Chutney music’, popular in Trinidad and Guyana, is another creative contemporary expression of the post-indenture experience. These forms of cultural fusion are part of the making of the global world, where things from different places get mixed, lose their original characteristics and become something entirely new. Most indentured workers stayed on after their contracts ended, or returned to their new homes after a short spell in India. Consequently, there are large communities of people of Indian descent in these countries. Have you heard of the Nobel Prize-winning writer 64 2020-21

Q. 4. Analyse the role and involvement of women in the readership and authorship of novels in India. 		 ,"Ans.  In the early decades of the 20th century, women in South India began writing novels and short stories.  A reason for the popularity of novels among women was that it allowed for a new conception of womanhood.  Some women authors also wrote about women who changed the world of both men and women.  Rokeya Hossein wrote a satiric fantasy in English called Sultana’s Dream  which shows a topsy-turvy world in which women take the place of men.  Hunnah Mullens, a Christian missionary and the author of ‘Karuna O Phulmonir Bibaran’ , wrote the first novel in Bengali, which tells her readers that she wrote in secret.","But not all families were liberal. Conservative Hindus believed that a literate girl would be widowed and Muslims feared that educated women would be corrupted by reading Urdu romances. Sometimes, rebel women defied such prohibition. We know the story of a girl in a conservative Muslim family of north India who secretly learnt to read and write in Urdu. Her family wanted her to read only the Arabic Quran which she did not understand. So she insisted on learning to read a language that was her own. In East Bengal, in the early nineteenth century, Rashsundari Debi, a young married girl in a very orthodox household, learnt to read in the secrecy of her kitchen. Later, she wrote her autobiography Amar Jiban which was published in 1876. It was the first full-length autobiography published in the Bengali language.

Q. 5. The early novelists in India played a significant role in spreading social awareness. Justify the statement with examples. ,"Ans.  The novelists played an important role in spreading social awareness by taking themes such as caste oppression life of the common people, marriage, practices, etc.  They tried to create social awareness on the prevalence of backward social customs which were exploitative in nature.  As early as 1857, Baba Padamanji’s Yamuna Paryatan, used a simple style of storytelling to speak about the plight of widows. In Sevasadan, Premchand deals mainly with the poor condition of women in societies. Issues like child marriage and dowry are woven into the story of the novel. Social evils like caste oppression was highlighted by Potheri Kunjambu a lower caste writer from North Kerala who wrote a novel called Saraswativijayam in 1892, mounting a strong attack on caste oppression. This man shows a young man from an untouchable caste leaving his village to escape cruelty of his Brahmin landlord. He converts to Christianity, obtains modern education and leads a respectable life with his family.  Hence issues like plight of widows, problems created by the early marriage of the girls and caste oppression were the important social issues which were highlighted through novels.  5","Very cheap small books were brought to markets in nineteenth-century Madras towns and sold at crossroads, allowing poor people travelling to markets to buy them. Public libraries were set up from the early twentieth century, expanding the access to books. These libraries were located mostly in cities and towns, and at times in prosperous villages. For rich local patrons, setting up a library was a way of acquiring prestige. From the late nineteenth century, issues of caste discrimination began to be written about in many printed tracts and essays. Jyotiba Phule, the Maratha pioneer of ‘low caste’ protest movements, wrote about the injustices of the caste system in his Gulamgiri (1871). In the twentieth century, B.R. Ambedkar in Maharashtra and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker in Madras, better known as Periyar, wrote powerfully on caste and their writings were read by people all over India. Local protest movements and sects also created a lot of popular journals and tracts criticising ancient scriptures and envisioning a new and just future. Workers in factories were too overworked and lacked the education to write much about their experiences. But Kashibaba, a Kanpur millworker, wrote and published Chhote Aur Bade Ka Sawal in 1938 to show the links between caste and class exploitation. The poems of another Kanpur millworker, who wrote under the name of Sudarshan Chakr between 1935 and 1955, were brought together and published in a collection called Sacchi Kavitayan. By the 1930s, Bangalore cotton millworkers set up libraries to educate themselves, following the example of Bombay workers. These were sponsored by social reformers who tried to restrict excessive drinking among them, to bring literacy and, sometimes, to propagate the message of nationalism. 126 2020-21

Q. 7. Describe the appearing of novels in South India during the period of colonial rule. ,"Ans. Some early English novels were translated into the Indian language, but soon it was realized that the readers are unfamiliar with the English culture of characters in the novel, for instance, their clothes, style of speaking language, manners. So novels were written in Malayalam in the manner of English novel books. A few early novels were translation of English novels into Indian languages. Later many writers like Chandu Menon and others started to write novels in their own language. Chandu Menon, a subjudge from Malabar tried to translate an English novel called Henrietta Temple written by Benjamin Disraeli into Malayalam, but he realized that his readers in Kerala were not familiar with the characters of English novels and so he gave up this idea and wrote a story in Malayalam in the manner of English novel books.

As more and more people could now read, they wanted to see their own lives, experiences, emotions and relationships reflected in what they read. The novel, a literary firm which had developed in Europe, ideally catered to this need. It soon acquired distinctively Indian forms and styles. For readers, it opened up new worlds of experience, and gave a vivid sense of the diversity of human lives. Other new literary forms also entered the world of reading – lyrics, short stories, essays about social and political matters. In different ways, they reinforced the new emphasis on human lives and intimate feelings, about the political and social rules that shaped such things.

With the setting up of an increasing number of printing presses, visual images could be easily reproduced in multiple copies. Painters like Raja Ravi Varma produced images for mass circulation. Poor wood engravers who made woodblocks set up shop near the letterpresses, and were employed by print shops. Cheap prints and calendars, easily available in the bazaar, could be bought even by the poor to decorate the walls of their homes or places of work.

Some of you may have followed the exploits of West Indies cricketers Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Ramnaresh Sarwan.

From the 1900s India’s nationalist leaders began opposing the system of indentured labour migration as abusive and cruel. It was abolished in 1921. Yet for a number of decades afterwards, descendants of Indian indentured workers, often thought of as ‘coolies’, remained an uneasy minority in the Caribbean islands.

The novels had the domestic life well-described which helped the British administrators to understand the beliefs and practices.  The nationalists used novels as a powerful medium to criticize the defects of the society and suggested remedies. Many novels established links with the past.

Q. 13. How did the colonial administrators find Vernacular novels as a valuable source of information to native life and customs ? Explain with examples. ,"Ans.  Colonial administrators found Vernacular novels to be a valuable available source of information on native life and customs.  As outsiders, the British knew little about life inside Indian households.  Novels helped the colonists understand Indian way of dressing, forms of worship, their beliefs and practices.  Many novels reflected social customs, divisions based on caste and class.  These novels helped the British understand the social divisions and used them to their advantage to create further divisions. Lord Bentinck helped the Indian reformers in their mission to get rid of the practices like ‘Sati’ and passed legislation favouring remarriage of widows.","Another means of creating a feeling of nationalism was through reinterpretation of history. By the end of the nineteenth century many Indians began feeling that to instill a sense of pride in the nation, Indian history had to be thought about differently. The British saw Indians as backward and primitive, incapable of governing themselves. In response, Indians began looking into the past to discover India’s great achievements. They wrote about the glorious developments in ancient times when art and architecture, science and mathematics, religion and culture, law and philosophy, crafts and trade had flourished. This glorious time, in their view, was followed by a history of decline, when India was colonised. These nationalist histories urged the readers to take pride in India’s great achievements in the past and struggle to change the miserable conditions of life under British rule.

 Very cheap small books were brought to markets in nineteenth-century Madras towns and sold at crossroads, allowing poor people travelling to markets to buy them. Public libraries were set up from the early twentieth century, expanding the access to books. These libraries were located mostly in cities and towns, and at times in prosperous villages. For rich local patrons, setting up a library was a way of acquiring prestige. From the late nineteenth century, issues of caste discrimination began to be written about in many printed tracts and essays. Jyotiba Phule, the Maratha pioneer of ‘low caste’ protest movements, wrote about the injustices of the caste system in his Gulamgiri (1871). In the twentieth century, B.R. Ambedkar in Maharashtra and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker in Madras, better known as Periyar, wrote powerfully on caste and their writings were read by people all over India. Local protest movements and sects also created a lot of popular journals and tracts criticising ancient scriptures and envisioning a new and just future. Workers in factories were too overworked and lacked the education to write much about their experiences. But Kashibaba, a Kanpur millworker, wrote and published Chhote Aur Bade Ka Sawal in 1938 to show the links between caste and class exploitation. The poems of another Kanpur millworker, who wrote under the name of Sudarshan Chakr between 1935 and 1955, were brought together and published in a collection called Sacchi Kavitayan. By the 1930s, Bangalore cotton millworkers set up libraries to educate themselves, following the example of Bombay workers. These were sponsored by social reformers who tried to restrict excessive drinking among them, to bring literacy and, sometimes, to propagate the message of nationalism. 126 2020-21

Q. 15. How the caste issue was included in novels in India ? Support your answer with suitable examples. 		,Ans.  Indulekha : It a hotly debated novel and the concern it addresses are of marriage practices of upper class Hindus in Kerala.  Potheri Kunjambu a ‘lower caste’ writer from North Kerala wrote ‘Saraswativijayam’ and attacked caste oppression.  Titash Ekti Nadir Naam : It was based on the fisher folk community.  Basheer was a Muslim writer with little formal education.  Premchand’s ‘Ranghoomi’ : The hero of this novel is a low caste whose land has forcibly been taken away.  ‘Godan’ : It is a story about Indian peasantry and how they are exploited.  ,"But not all families were liberal. Conservative Hindus believed that a literate girl would be widowed and Muslims feared that educated women would be corrupted by reading Urdu romances. Sometimes, rebel women defied such prohibition. We know the story of a girl in a conservative Muslim family of north India who secretly learnt to read and write in Urdu. Her family wanted her to read only the Arabic Quran which she did not understand. So she insisted on learning to read a language that was her own. In East Bengal, in the early nineteenth century, Rashsundari Debi, a young married girl in a very orthodox household, learnt to read in the secrecy of her kitchen. Later, she wrote her autobiography Amar Jiban which was published in 1876. It was the first full-length autobiography published in the Bengali language.
 Fig. 18 – The cover page of Indian Charivari. The Indian Charivari was one of the many journals of caricature and satire published in the late nineteenth century. Notice that the imperial British figure is positioned right at the centre. He is authoritative and imperial; telling the natives what is to be done. The natives sit on either side of him, servile and submissive. The Indians are being shown a copy of Punch, the British journal of cartoons and satire. You can almost hear the British master say – ‘This is the model, produce Indian versions of it.’
 Since social reforms and novels had already created a great interest in women’s lives and emotions, there was also an interest in what women would have to say about their own lives. From the 1860s, a few Bengali women like Kailashbashini Debi wrote books highlighting the experiences of women – about how women were imprisoned at home, kept in ignorance, forced to do hard domestic labour and treated unjustly by the very people they served.

 V.S. Naipaul? Some of you may have followed the exploits of West Indies cricketers Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Ramnaresh Sarwan. If you have wondered why their names sound vaguely Indian, the answer is that they are descended from indentured labour migrants from India. From the 1900s India’s nationalist leaders began opposing the system of indentured labour migration as abusive and cruel. It was abolished in 1921. Yet for a number of decades afterwards, descendants of Indian indentured workers, often thought of as ‘coolies’, remained an uneasy minority in the Caribbean islands. Some of Naipaul’s early novels capture their sense of loss and alienation.

Q. 1. Why did London city dwellers become rebellious during 19th century. ,"Ans.  The vast mass of one room houses occupied by the poor were seen as a serious threat to public health.  Cities were overcrowded, badly ventilated, and lacked sanitation.  There were worries about fire hazards created by poor housing.  There was a widespread fear of social disorder, especially after the Russian Revolution in 1917.  Worker's mass housing schemes were planned to prevent the London poor from turning rebellious.","The poorer peasantry were not just interested in the lowering of the revenue demand. Many of them were small tenants cultivating land they had rented from landlords. As the Depression continued and cash incomes dwindled, the small tenants found it difficult to pay their rent. They wanted the unpaid rent to the landlord to be remitted. They joined a variety of radical movements, often led by Socialists and Communists. Apprehensive of raising issues that might upset the rich peasants and landlords, the Congress was unwilling to support ‘no rent’ campaigns in most places. So the relationship between the poor peasants and the Congress remained uncertain. 41 2020-21
 Fig. 10 – Houseless and Hungry, painting by Samuel Luke Fildes, 1874. This painting shows the homeless in London applying for tickets to stay overnight in a workhouse. These shelters were maintained under the supervision of the Poor Law Commissioners for the ‘destitute, wayfarers, wanderers and foundling’. Staying in these workhouses was a humiliating experience: everyone was subjected to a medical examination to see whether they were carrying disease, their bodies were cleansed, and their clothes purified. They had to also do hard labour.

 shelters. Some stayed in Night Refuges that were set up by private individuals; others went to the Casual Wards maintained by the Poor Law authorities. Seasonality of work in many industries meant prolonged periods without work. After the busy season was over, the poor were on the streets again. Some returned to the countryside after the winter, when the demand for labour in the rural areas opened up in places. But most looked for odd jobs, which till the mid-nineteenth century were difficult to find. Wages increased somewhat in the early nineteenth century. But they tell us little about the welfare of the workers. The average figures hide the variations between trades and the fluctuations from year to year. For instance, when prices rose sharply during the prolonged Napoleonic War, the real value of what the workers earned fell significantly, since the same wages could now buy fewer things. Moreover, the income of workers depended not on the wage rate alone. What was also critical was the period of employment: the number of days of work determined the average daily income of the workers. At the best of times till the mid-nineteenth century, about 10 per cent of the urban population were extremely poor. In periods of economic slump, like the 1830s, the proportion of unemployed went up to anything between 35 and 75 per cent in different regions. The fear of unemployment made workers hostile to the introduction of new technology. When the Spinning Jenny was introduced in

Q. 2. Why were Victorian industrialists not interested to introduce mechanism in England ? Give any four reasons. Or 		Why did some industrialists in the 19th century Europe prefer hand labour over machines ? Explain.  		 Or 		Why could mechanical technology not replace human labour in Victorian Britain ? Explain. ,"Ans. In victorian Britain, there was no shortage of human labour, so industrialists had no problem of labour shortage or high wage costs. They did not want to introduce machines that got rid of human labour and required large capital investment.  In many industries the demand for labour was seasonal. Gas works and breweries were especially busy through the cold months. So they needed more workers to meet their peak demand. Book binders and printers, catering to X-mas demand, too needed extra hands before December.  A range of products could be produced only with hand labour. Machines were oriented to produce uniform standardised goods for a mass market. But the demand in the market was often for goods with intricate designs and specific shapes.  The aristocrats and bourgeoisie preferred things produced by hand in Victorian Britain. Hand-made products came to symbolise refinement and class.  Hand-made products were better finished, individually produced and carefully designed.","In Victorian Britain there was no shortage of human labour. Poor peasants and vagrants moved to the cities in large numbers in search of jobs, waiting for work. As you will know, when there is plenty of labour, wages are low. So industrialists had no problem of labour shortage or high wage costs. They did not want to introduce machines that got rid of human labour and required large capital investment.
 hammers were produced and 45 kinds of axes. These required human skill, not mechanical technology. In Victorian Britain, the upper classes – the aristocrats and the bourgeoisie – preferred things produced by hand. Handmade products came to symbolise refinement and class. They were better finished, individually produced, and carefully designed. Machinemade goods were for export to the colonies. In countries with labour shortage, industrialists were keen on using mechanical power so that the need for human labour can be minimised. This was the case in nineteenth-century America. Britain, however, had no problem hiring human hands.

"Q. 3. What was ‘proto-industrialization’ ? Explain the importance of proto-industrialization.  [Board Term 1, 2014 , (WQ7FXWC ] Or 		 What is meant by Proto-industrialization ? Explain any four economic effects of the Proto-industrial system.  Or 		What is meant by Proto-industrialization ? How did it affect the rural peasants and artisans ? ","Ans. Proto-industrialization refers to the system of industries that existed in Europe before the arrival of modern machine run factories. Large scale industrial production took place for an international market. It was based in the countryside, not in factories. Effects :  Open fields were disappearing and commons were being enclosed so common people had no alternative sources of income.  Many had small plots of land which could not provide work for all family members.  Merchants offered them advances for which they agreed.  They got a source of income which supplemented their shrinking income from cultivation.","3. Explain what is meant by proto-industrialisation.
 "
Q. 4. Explain the process of industrialization in Britain during the nineteenth century.  Or What were the principal features of Industrialization process of England in 19th century ? ,Ans.  Cotton industry grew rapidly followed by iron and steel industry.  Introduction of railways added to industrial growth.  New factories could not displace traditional industries.  Industries tried to improve their speed and quality of production.  Implementation of technology happened at a slow rate.,"Second: the new industries could not easily displace traditional industries. Even at the end of the nineteenth century, less than 20 per cent of the total workforce was employed in technologically advanced industrial sectors. Textiles was a dynamic sector, but a large portion of the output was produced not within factories, but outside, within domestic units. Third: the pace of change in the ‘traditional’ industries was not set by steam-powered cotton or metal industries, but they did not remain entirely stagnant either. Seemingly ordinary and small innovations were the basis of growth in many non-mechanised sectors such as food processing, building, pottery, glass work, tanning, furniture making, and production of implements.

Q. 5. Describe any five major problems faced by new European merchants in setting up their industries in towns before the industrial revolution. ,"Ans.  Due to the expansion of world trade, the merchants wanted to expand their production. But trade and craft guilds were very powerful.  They could create money problems for the merchants in their town.  Rulers had granted different guilds and the monopoly rights to produce and trade in specific products. So merchants were handicapped in towns.  Guilds regulated competition and prices.  In the countryside, peasants and artisans were available for work. ","In the countryside poor peasants and artisans began working for merchants. As you have seen in the textbook last year, this was a time when open fields were disappearing and commons were being enclosed. Cottagers and poor peasants who had earlier depended on common lands for their survival, gathering their firewood, berries, vegetables, hay and straw, had to now look for alternative sources of income. Many had tiny plots of land which could not provide work for all members of the household. So when merchants came around and offered advances to produce goods for them, peasant households eagerly agreed. By working for the merchants, they
 The Age of Industrialisation
 In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, merchants from the towns in Europe began moving to the countryside, supplying money to peasants and artisans, persuading them to produce for an international market. With the expansion of world trade and the acquisition of colonies in different parts of the world, the demand for goods began growing. But merchants could not expand production within towns. This was because here urban crafts and trade guilds were powerful. These were associations of producers that trained craftspeople, maintained control over production, regulated competition and prices, and restricted the entry of new people into the trade. Rulers granted different guilds the monopoly right to produce and trade in specific products. It was therefore difficult for new merchants to set up business in towns. So they turned to the countryside.

Q. 6. “Getting a job in factories was always difficult in the 19th century.” Justify the statement comparing the case of England and India. ,"Ans.  England : The actual possibility of getting a job depended on existing network of friendship and kin relationship. A person was more likely to get a job if he had a friend or a relative working in the factory. Many who did not have connections had to wait for weeks spending nights under bridges or in the night shelters.  India : In India, the member of job seekers was always more than the jobs available. Industrialists usually employed jobbers, who usually were old and trusted workers to get new recruits. The jobber got people from his village, ensured them job and helped them settle in the city. Jobbers eventually began demanding money for the favours they showed and controlled the lives of workers. ","4.2 Where Did the Workers Come From? Factories needed workers. With the expansion of factories, this demand increased. In 1901, there were 584,000 workers in Indian factories. By 1946 the number was over 2,436, 000. Where did the workers come from?
 Over time, as news of employment spread, workers travelled great distances in the hope of work in the mills. From the United Provinces, for instance, they went to work in the textile mills of Bombay and in the jute mills of Calcutta.

 In most industrial regions workers came from the districts around. Peasants and artisans who found no work in the village went to the industrial centres in search of work. Over 50 per cent workers in the Bombay cotton industries in 1911 came from the neighbouring district of Ratnagiri, while the mills of Kanpur got most of their textile hands from the villages within the district of Kanpur. Most often millworkers moved between the village and the city, returning to their village homes during harvests and festivals. Fig. 19 – Young workers of a Bombay mill, early twentieth century. When workers went back to their village homes, they liked dressing up.

 Getting jobs was always difficult, even when mills multiplied and the demand for workers increased. The numbers seeking work were always more than the jobs available. Entry into the mills was also restricted. Industrialists usually employed a jobber to get new recruits. Very often the jobber was an old and trusted worker. He got people from his village, ensured them jobs, helped them settle in the city and provided them money in times of crisis. The jobber therefore became a person with some authority and power. He began demanding money and gifts for his favour and controlling the lives of workers. The number of factory workers increased over time. However, as you will see, they were a small proportion of the total industrial workforce. Source E Vasant Parkar, who was once a millworker in Bombay, said: ‘The workers would pay the jobbers money to get their sons work in the mill … The mill worker was closely associated with his village, physically and emotionally. He would go home to cut the harvest and for sowing. The Konkani would go home to cut the paddy and the Ghati, the sugarcane. It was an accepted practice for which the mills granted leave.’

Q. 7. Describe the life of the workers in Victorian Britain. ,Ans.  Labour was in abundance.  Job opportunities were few.  Job seekers who came from villages had to spend the night under bridges or in night shelters and they had no place to stay in the city.  Much of the work was seasonal in nature such as book binding.  Wages were low and life was difficult when prices of goods in the city rose sharply.  Workers had to look for odd jobs when they could not find proper employment in factories. ,"The abundance of labour in the market affected the lives of workers.

Q. 8. Enumerate the features of the proto-industrial system. ,"Ans.  It was a decentralised system of production.  Control on production was in the hands of merchants but goods were produced by a vast number of producers working in their family farms.  Whole family was involved in such a system.  Each merchant was controlling hundreds of workers.  By working for their merchants, workers could remain in the countryside and continue to cultivate their small plots.","In the countryside poor peasants and artisans began working for merchants.

 could remain in the countryside and continue to cultivate their small plots. Income from proto-industrial production supplemented their shrinking income from cultivation. It also allowed them a fuller use of their family labour resources. Within this system a close relationship developed between the town and the countryside. Merchants were based in towns but the work was done mostly in the countryside. A merchant clothier in England purchased wool from a wool stapler, and carried it to the spinners; the yarn (thread) that was spun was taken in subsequent stages of production to weavers, fullers, and then to dyers. The finishing was done in London before the export merchant sold the cloth in the international market. London in fact came to be known as a finishing centre.
 New words Stapler – A person who ‘staples’ or sorts wool according to its fibre Fuller – A person who ‘fulls’ – that is, gathers – cloth by pleating Carding – The process in which fibres, such as cotton or wool, are prepared prior to spinning
 This proto-industrial system was thus part of a network of commercial exchanges. It was controlled by merchants and the goods were produced by a vast number of producers working within their family farms, not in factories. At each stage of production 20 to 25 workers were employed by each merchant. This meant that each clothier was controlling hundreds of workers.

Q. 10. How did the Industrial Revolution in England affect Indian economy ? ,"Ans. Affects of Industrial Revolution in England on Indian Economy :  Before the Industrial Revolution, India was a major producer of cotton and indigo, spices but after revolution it suffered a set back.  Industrial Revolution enabled England to produce more and more goods at cheaper rates. So they chose India as a vast market.

Q. 1. What led the colonial government to pass the Vernacular Press Act in 1878 ? How did it affect the vernacular Newspaper ? ,"Ans.  Nationalists in India used print media to publish the evil affects of British rule and spread new ideas.  As vernacular newspapers became assertively nationalist, the colonial government decided to take strong measures.  In 1878 the vernacular press act was passed which provided the government with intensive rights to censor reports and efitorials in the vernacular press.  The government started keeping regular track on vernacular news papers. If it published some material which was considered to be seditious, the government seized the press and confiscated the printing machines.  Despite repressive measures nationalist newspapers grew in numbers in all parts of India.","By the 1820s, the Calcutta Supreme Court passed certain regulations to control press freedom and the Company began encouraging publication of newspapers that would celebrate Britsh rule. In 1835, faced with urgent petitions by editors of English and vernacular newspapers, Governor-General Bentinck agreed to revise press laws. Thomas Macaulay, a liberal colonial official, formulated new rules that restored the earlier freedoms. After the revolt of 1857, the attitude to freedom of the press changed. Enraged Englishmen demanded a clamp down on the ‘native’ press. As vernacular newspapers became assertively nationalist, the colonial government began debating measures of stringent control. In 1878, the Vernacular Press Act was passed, modelled on the Irish Press Laws. It provided the government with extensive rights to censor reports and editorials in the vernacular press. From now on the government kept regular track of the vernacular newspapers published in different provinces. When a report was judged as seditious, the newspaper was warned, and if the warning was ignored, the press was liable to be seized and the printing machinery confiscated. Despite repressive measures, nationalist newspapers grew in numbers in all parts of India. They reported on colonial misrule and encouraged nationalist activities. Attempts to throttle nationalist criticism provoked militant protest. This in turn led to a renewed cycle of persecution and protests. When Punjab revolutionaries were deported in 1907, Balgangadhar Tilak wrote with great sympathy about them in his Kesari. This led to his imprisonment in 1908, provoking in turn widespread protests all over India.

Q. 2. What was the attitude of liberal and conservative Indians towards women’s reading ? How did woman like Kailashbashini Debi respond to this in her writings ?  Or 		Describe the attitude of liberal and conservative Indian’s towards women’s reading ?,"Ans.  Liberal husbands and fathers began educating their women folk at home and sent them to schools.  Conservative Hindus believed that a literate girl would be widowed and Muslims feared that educated women would be corrupted by reading romantic books. Kailashbashini Debi wrote books highlighting the experiences of women-how women were imprisoned at home, kept in ignorance, forced to do hard domestic labour. ","8.1 Women and Print Lives and feelings of women began to be written in particularly vivid and intense ways. Women’s reading, therefore, increased enormously in middle-class homes. Liberal husbands and fathers began educating their womenfolk at home, and sent them to schools when women’s schools were set up in the cities and towns after the mid-nineteenth century. Many journals began carrying writings by women, and explained why women should be educated. They also carried a syllabus and attached suitable reading matter which could be used for home-based schooling.
 India and the Contemporary World
 But not all families were liberal. Conservative Hindus believed that a literate girl would be widowed and Muslims feared that educated women would be corrupted by reading Urdu romances. Sometimes, rebel women defied such prohibition. We know the story of a girl in a conservative Muslim family of north India who secretly learnt to read and write in Urdu. Her family wanted her to read only the Arabic Quran which she did not understand. So she insisted on learning to read a language that was her own. In East Bengal, in the early nineteenth century, Rashsundari Debi, a young married girl in a very orthodox household, learnt to read in the secrecy of her kitchen. Later, she wrote her autobiography Amar Jiban which was published in 1876. It was the first full-length autobiography published in the Bengali language.

 Since social reforms and novels had already created a great interest in women’s lives and emotions, there was also an interest in what women would have to say about their own lives.

 the early twentieth century, journals, written for and sometimes edited by women, became extremely popular. They discussed issues like women’s education, widowhood, widow remarriage and the national movement. Some of them offered household and fashion lessons to women and brought entertainment through short stories and serialised novels. In Punjab, too, a similar folk literature was widely printed from the early twentieth century. Ram Chaddha published the fast-selling Istri Dharm Vichar to teach women how to be obedient wives. The Khalsa Tract Society published cheap booklets with a similar message. Many of these were in the form of dialogues about the qualities of a good woman.

Q. 3. How were the manuscripts written in India before the age of print ? What were their drawbacks and effect ? ,"Ans.  In India, manuscripts were written on palm leaves or on handmade paper before the age of print.  Pages were sometimes beautifully illustrated.  They would be either pressed between wooden covers or sewn together to ensure preservation.  Manuscripts continued to be produced till well after the introduction of print, down to the late nineteenth century.  Manuscripts, however, were highly expensive and fragile. They had to be handled carefully and they could not be read easily as script was written in different styles.","6.1 Manuscripts Before the Age of Print India had a very rich and old tradition of handwritten manuscripts – in Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, as well as in various vernacular languages. Manuscripts were copied on palm leaves or on handmade paper. Pages were sometimes beautifully illustrated. They would be either pressed between wooden covers or sewn together to ensure preservation. Manuscripts continued to be produced till well after the introduction of print, down to the late nineteenth century.
 Print Culture
 Manuscripts, however, were highly expensive and fragile. They had to be handled carefully, and they could not be read easily as the
 script was written in different styles. So manuscripts were not widely used in everyday life. Even though pre-colonial Bengal had developed an extensive network of village primary schools, students very often did not read texts. They only learnt to write. Teachers dictated portions of texts from memory and students wrote them down. Many thus became literate without ever actually reading any kinds of texts.

From 19th century, issues of caste discrimination began to be written.  Jyotiba Phule, the Maratha pioneer of low caste, started protest movement. He wrote about the injustice of the caste system in his Gulamgiri.  B. R. Ambedkar in Maharashtra and E.V. Ramaswamy in Madras wrote powerfully on caste.

Q. 5. Evaluate the role of print in connecting various communities in different parts of India. ,"Ans.  In Bengal as the debate developed, tracts and newspapers proliferated, circulating a variety of arguments.  To reach a wider audience, the ideas were printed in the everyday spoken language of ordinary people.  Ram Mohan Roy published the ‘Sambad Kaumudi’ from 1821 and the Hindu orthodoxy commissioned the ‘Samachar Chandrika’ to oppose his opinion.  A wider range of people could not participate in these public discussions and express their views.  New ideas emerged through these clashes of opinions.  Newspapers conveyed news from one place to another, creating pan-Indian identities.","This was a time of intense controversies between social and religious reformers and the Hindu orthodoxy over matters like widow immolation, monotheism, Brahmanical priesthood and idolatry.

To reach a wider audience, the ideas were printed in the everyday, spoken language of ordinary people. Rammohun Roy published the Sambad Kaumudi from 1821 and the Hindu orthodoxy commissioned the Samachar Chandrika to oppose his opinions. From 1822, two Persian newspapers were published, Jam-i-Jahan Nama and Shamsul Akhbar. In the same year, a Gujarati newspaper, the Bombay Samachar, made its appearance.
 the Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas, a sixteenth-century text, came out from Calcutta in 1810. By the mid-nineteenth century, cheap lithographic editions flooded north Indian markets. From the 1880s, the Naval Kishore Press at Lucknow and the Shri Venkateshwar Press in Bombay published numerous religious texts in vernaculars. In their printed and portable form, these could be read easily by the faithful at any place and time. They could also be read out to large groups of illiterate men and women. Religious texts, therefore, reached a very wide circle of people, encouraging discussions, debates and controversies within and among different religions. Print did not only stimulate the publication of conflicting opinions amongst communities, but it also connected communities and people in different parts of India. Newspapers conveyed news from one place to another, creating pan-Indian identities.

As more and more people could now read, they wanted to see their own lives, experiences, emotions and relationships reflected in what they read. The novel, a literary firm which had developed in Europe, ideally catered to this need. It soon acquired distinctively Indian forms and styles. For readers, it opened up new worlds of experience, and gave a vivid sense of the diversity of human lives. Other new literary forms also entered the world of reading – lyrics, short stories, essays about social and political matters. In different ways, they reinforced the new emphasis on human lives and intimate feelings, about the political and social rules that shaped such things. By the end of the nineteenth century, a new visual culture was taking shape. With the setting up of an increasing number of printing presses, visual images could be easily reproduced in multiple copies. Painters like Raja Ravi Varma produced images for mass circulation. Poor wood engravers who made woodblocks set up shop near the letterpresses, and were employed by print shops. Cheap prints and calendars, easily available in the bazaar, could be bought even by the poor to decorate the walls of their homes or places of work. These prints began shaping popular ideas about modernity and tradition, religion and politics, and society and culture.

Q. 1. Why is roof top water harvesting important in Rajasthan ? Explain. ,"Ans. Roof top water harvesting is important in Rajasthan because :  It was commonly practised to store drinking water.  The rainwater can be stored in the tankas till the next rainfall making it an extremely reliable source of drinking water when all other sources are dried up, particularly in the summers.  Rain water, or palar pani, as commonly referred to in these parts, is considered the purest form of natural water.  Many houses construct underground rooms adjoing the ‘tanka’ to beat the summer heat as it would keep the room cool.  Some houses still maintain the tanks since they do not like the taste of top water.","In the semi-arid and arid regions of Rajasthan, particularly in Bikaner, Phalodi a n d B a r m e r, a l m o s t a l l t h e h o u s e s traditionally had underground tanks or tankas for storing drinking water. The tanks could be as large as a big room; one household in Phalodi had a tank that was 6.1 metres deep, 4.27 metres long and 2.44 metres wide. The tankas were part of the well-developed rooftop rainwater harvesting system and were built inside the main house or the courtyard. They were connected to the sloping roofs of the houses through a pipe. Rain falling on the rooftops would travel down the pipe and was stored in these underground ‘tankas’. The first spell of rain was usually not collected as this would clean the roofs and the pipes. The rainwater from the subsequent showers was then collected. The rainwater can be stored in the tankas till the next rainfall making it an extremely reliable source of drinking water when all other sources are dried up,

 particularly in the summers. Rainwater, or palar pani, as commonly referred to in these parts, is considered the purest form of natural water. Many houses constructed underground rooms adjoining the ‘tanka’ to beat the summer heat as it would keep the room cool.
 Today, in western Rajasthan, sadly the practice of rooftop rainwater harvesting is on the decline as plenty of water is available due to the perennial Indira Gandhi Canal, though some houses still maintain the tankas since they do not like the taste of tap water.

Q. 3. Describe any four traditional methods of rain water harvesting adopted in different parts of India. ,"Ans.		 Methods of rain water harvesting used in India are :  Guls and Kuls : People built guls and kuls in hilly and mountainous regions to divert water. These are simple channels. They are mainly used in Western Himalayas.  Roof top rain water harvesting : Commonly practised to store drinking water in Rajasthan.  Inundation Channels : These channels developed in the flood plains of Bengal to irrigate fields.  Khadins and Johads : In arid and semi-arid regions, some agricultural fields were converted into rain fed storage structures. These structures are found in Rajasthan.  Tanks : In Bikaner, Phalodi and Barmer, almost all houses have tanks for storing drinking water. Tanks are part of the well-developed roof top rain water harvesting system.  5 ¾¾ Types of farming ; major crops ; cropping pattern ; technological and institutional reforms ; their impact ; contribution of agriculture to national economy—employment and output. zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz Since agriculture is an age-old economic activity in India, farming varies from subsistence to commercial type. At TOPIC - 1 present, in different parts of India, the following farming Types of Farming, Cropping Pattern systems are practised : and Major Crops .... P. 88  Primitive subsistence farming : It depends upon TOPIC - 2 monsoon, natural fertility of the soil and suitability of Technological and Institutional other environmental conditions to the crops grown. Reforms .... P. 91  Intensive subsistence farming : It is done where high doses of biochemical inputs and irrigation are used for obtaining higher production.  Commercial farming : In this type of farming, the main thing is the use of higher doses of modern inputs e.g., high yielding variety  seeds, chemical fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides in order to obtain higher productivity. The three cropping seasons of India are : Rabi, Kharif and Zaid. Rabi crops are sown in winter from October to December and harvested in summer from April to June. Kharif crops are grown with the onset of monsoon in different parts of the country and these are harvested in September to October. Between the Rabi and the Kharif seasons, there is a short season during the summer, known as the Zaid season. Major crops grown in India are rice, wheat, millets, pulses, tea, coffee, sugarcane, oilseeds, cotton, and jute. Horticulture crops : India is the largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the world. India is a producer of tropical as well as temperate fruits. India produces about 13 percent of the world’s vegetables. It is an important producer of pea, cauliflower, onion, cabbage, tomato, brinjal and potato. The non-food crops grown in India are rubber, fibre crops, cotton, jute, etc. Rearing of silk worms for the production of silk fibre is known as sericulture. Agriculture, which provides livelihood for more than 60 percent of its population, needs some serious technical and institutional reforms. Thus, collectivisation, consolidation of holdings and abolition of Zamindari etc. were given priority to bring about institutional reforms. India’s food security policy has a primary objective to ensure availability of food grains to the common people at an affordable price. It has enabled the poor to have access to the food. The green revolution promised improvement in the condition of marginal and small farmers. Genetic engineering is recognised as a powerful supplement in inventing new hybrid varieties of seeds. zz zz zz zz Agriculture : The science and art of cultivating soil, raising crops and rearing animals. Primitive Subsistence Farming : Farming on small patch of land with the help of primitive tools such as hoe, dao and digging sticks and family or community labour. Intensive Subsistence Farming : Increase in the agricultural production by using scientific methods and better agricultural inputs. Plantation Farming : In this type of farming, a single crop is grown on a large area. zzCommercial Farming : Farming in which the farmer grows the crops with the sole aim of selling the produce for commercial purpose. zzSericulture : Rearing of silk worms for the production of silk. zzHorticulture : Intensive cultivation of vegetables, fruits and flower crops. zzJhumming : Burning a piece of land for cultivation by a forest tribes. zzThe Green Revolution : Technologies that were introduced to increase the agricultural production such as use of HYV of seeds, fertilizers, modern machinery and inputs. zzWhite Revolution : Also called ‘Operation Flood’ technology that was introduced to increase milk production. zzBloodless Revolution : Bhoodan and Gramdan Movement initiated by Vinoba Bhave in 1951 is known as the Bloodless Revloution. zzRabi : Crops are grown at the beginning of winters and harvested at the beginning of summers. zzKharif : Crops are grown with the onset of monsoon and harvested at the beginning of winters. zzZaid : A short cropping season in between the Rabi and the Kharif seasons used for growing vegetables and fodder crops. zzMillets : Jowar, Bajra and Ragi are called millets. These are known as coarse grains. zzCrop Rotation : Growing of different crops in succession on the same field from season to season to maintain soil fertility. zzIrrigation : An artificial means of watering the standing crops is called irrigation. zzICAR : Indian Council of Agriculture Research. zzFCI : Food Corporation of India. zzOrganic Farming : Farming which is practised without factory made chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides. zzMinimum Support Price  : A minimum guaranteed price of a crop, fixed and announced by the government before the start of a cropping season. zzKissan Credit Card  : This is a credit card to provide affordable credit for farmers in India. 1.

These are also reflected in agricultural practices and cropping patterns in the country. Various types of food and fibre crops, vegetables and fruits, spices and condiments, etc. constitute some of the important crops grown in the country. India has three cropping seasons — rabi, kharif and zaid. Rabi crops are sown in winter from October to December and harvested in summer from April to June. Some of the important rabi crops are wheat, barley, peas, gram and mustard. Though, these crops are grown in large parts of India, states from the north and north-western parts such as Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are important for the production of wheat and other rabi crops. Availability of precipitation during winter months due to the western temperate cyclones helps in the success of these crops. However, the success of the green revolution in Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan has also been an important factor in the growth of the abovementioned rabi crops. K harif crops are grown with the onset of monsoon in different parts of the country and these are harvested in September-October. Important crops grown during this season are paddy, maize, jowar, bajra, tur (arhar), moong, urad, cotton, jute, groundnut and soyabean. Some of the most important ricegrowing regions are Assam, West Bengal, coastal regions of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra, particularly the (Konkan coast) along with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Recently, paddy has also become an important crop of Punjab and Haryana. In states like Assam, West Bengal and Odisha, three crops of paddy are grown in a year. These are Aus, Aman and Boro. In between the rabi and the kharif seasons, there is a short season during the summer months known as the Zaid season. Some of the crops produced during ‘zaid’ are 36

 and smaller as the population rises. India’s rural population is about 833 million (2011) which depends upon 250 million (approximate) hectares of agricultural land, an average of less than half a hectare per person. Indian farmers should diversify their cropping pattern from cereals to high-value crops. This will increase incomes and reduce environmental degradation simultaneously. Because fruits, medicinal herbs, flowers, vegetables, bio-diesel crops like jatropha and jojoba need much less irrigation than rice or sugarcane. India’s diverse climate can be harnessed to grow a wide range of high-value crops.

It is a kharif crop and requires 6 to 8 months to mature. Major cotton-producing states are– Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Kar nataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Jute: It is known as the golden fibre. Jute grows well on well-drained fertile soils in the flood plains where soils are renewed every year. High temperature is required during the time of growth. West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Odisha and Meghalaya are the major jute producing states. It is used in making gunny bags, mats, ropes, yarn, carpets and other artefacts. Due to its high cost, it is losing market to synthetic fibres and packing materials, particularly the nylon. Technological and Institutional Reforms It was mentioned in the previous pages that agriculture has been practised in India for thousands of years. Sustained uses of land without compatible techno-institutional changes have hindered the pace of agricultural development. Inspite of development of sources of irrigation most of the farmers in large parts of the country still depend upon monsoon and natural fertility in order to carry on their agriculture. For a growing population, this poses a serious challenge. Agriculture which provides livelihood for more than 60 per cent of its population, needs some serious technical and institutional reforms. Thus, collectivisation, consolidation of holdings, cooperation and abolition of zamindari, etc. were given priority to bring about institutional reforms in the country after Independence. ‘Land reform’ was the main focus of our First Five Year Plan. The right of inheritance had already lead to fragmentation of land holdings necessitating consolidation of holdings. The laws of land reforms were enacted but the implementation was lacking or lukewarm. The Government of India embarked upon introducing agricultural reforms to improve Indian agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s. The Green Revolution based on the use of package technology and the White Revolution (Operation Flood) were

 some of the strategies initiated to improve the lot of Indian agriculture. But, this too led to the concentration of development in few selected areas. Therefore, in the 1980s and 1990s, a comprehensive land development programme was initiated, which included both institutional and technical reforms. Provision for crop insurance against drought, flood, cyclone, fire and disease, establishment of Grameen banks, cooperative societies and banks for providing loan facilities to the farmers at lower rates of interest were some important steps in this direction. K issan Credit Card (KCC), Personal Accident Insurance Scheme (PAIS) are some other schemes introduced by the Government of India for the benefit of the farmers. Moreover, special weather bulletins and agricultural programmes for farmers were introduced on the radio and television. The government also announces minimum support price, remunerative and procurement prices for important crops to check the exploitation of farmers by speculators and middlemen.

Q. 1. Explain any three reasons responsible for water scarcity in India ?  Or 		 Water is available in abundance in India even then scarcity of water is experienced in major parts of the country. Explain it with four examples. 5 marks each,"Ans.  The availability of water resources varies over space and time, mainly due to the variations in seasonal and annual precipitation.  Over-exploitation, excessive use and unequal access to water among different social groups.  Water scarcity may be an outcome of large and growing population and consequent greater demands for water. A large population means more water to produce more food. Hence, to facilitate higher food-grain production, water resources are being over exploited to expand irrigated areas for dry-season agriculture.  Most farmers have their own wells and tubewells in their farms for irrigation to increase their production. But it may lead to falling groundwater levels, adversely affecting water availability and food security of the people. Thus, inspite of abundant water there is water scarcity.  1¼×4=5","You already know that three-fourth of the earth’s surface is covered with water, but only a small proportion of it accounts for freshwater that can be put to use. This freshwater is mainly obtained from surface run off and ground water that is continually being renewed and recharged through the hydrological cycle. All water moves within the hydrological cycle ensuring that water is a renewable resource. You might wonder that if three-fourth of the world is covered with water and water is a renewable resource, then how is it that countries and regions around the globe suffer from water scarcity? Why is it predicted that by 2025, nearly two billion people will live in absolute water scarcity?

Over these years, cultivation methods have changed significantly depending upon the characteristics of physical environment, technological know-how and socio-cultural practices. Farming varies from subsistence to commercial type. At present, in different parts of India, the following farming systems are practised. Primitive Subsistence Farming This type of farming is still practised in few pockets of India. Primitive subsistence agriculture is practised on small patches of land with the help of primitive tools like hoe, dao and digging sticks, and family/ community labour. This type of farming depends upon monsoon, natural fertility of the soil and suitability of other environmental conditions to the crops grown. It is a ‘slash and burn’ agriculture. Farmers clear a patch of land and produce cereals and other food crops to sustain their family. When the soil fertility decreases, the farmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land for cultivation. This type of shifting allows Nature to replenish the fertility of the soil

 Intensive Subsistence Farming This type of farming is practised in areas of high population pressure on land. It is labourintensive farming, where high doses of biochemical inputs and irrigation are used for obtaining higher production.
 Plantation is also a type of commercial farming. In this type of farming, a single crop is grown on a large area. The plantation has an interface of agriculture and industry. Plantations cover large tracts of land, using capital intensive inputs, with the help of migrant labourers. All the produce is used as raw material in respective industries. In India, tea, coffee, rubber, sugarcane, banana, etc., are important plantation crops. Tea in Assam and North Bengal coffee in K arnataka are some of the important plantation crops grown in these states. Since the production is mainly for market, a welldeveloped network of transport and communication connecting the plantation areas, processing industries and markets plays an important role in the development of plantations.

Major Crops A variety of food and non food crops are grown in dif ferent parts of the country depending upon the variations in soil, climate and cultivation practices. Major crops grown in India are rice, wheat, millets, pulses, tea, coffee, sugarcane, oil seeds, cotton and jute, etc. Rice: It is the staple food crop of a majority of the people in India. Our country is the second largest producer of rice in the world after China. It is a kharif crop which requires high temperature, (above 25°C) and high humidity with annual rainfall above 100 cm. In the areas of less rainfall, it grows with the help of irrigation.
 Pulses: India is the largest producer as well as the consumer of pulses in the world. These are the major source of protein in a vegetarian diet. Major pulses that are grown in India are tur (arhar), urad, moong, masur, peas and gram. Can you distinguish which of these pulses are grown in the kharif season and which are grown in the rabi season? Pulses need less moisture and survive even in dry conditions. Being leguminous crops, all these crops except arhar help in restoring soil fertility by fixing nitrogen from the air. Therefore, these are mostly grown in rotation with other crops. Major pulse producing states in India are Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka. Food Crops other than Grains Sugarcane: It is a tropical as well as a subtropical crop. It grows well in hot and humid climate with a temperature of 21°C to 27°C and an annual rainfall between 75cm. and 100cm. Irrigation is required in the regions of low rainfall. It can be grown on a variety of soils and needs manual labour from
 sowing to harvesting. India is the second largest producer of sugarcane only after Brazil. It is the main source of sugar, gur (jaggary), khandsari and molasses. The major sugarcane-producing states are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kar nataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, Punjab and Haryana. Oil Seeds: In 2016 India was the second largest producer of groundnut in the world after china. In rapeseed production India was third largest producer in the world after Canada and China in 2016. Different oil seeds are grown covering approximately 12 per cent of the total cropped area of the country. Main oil-seeds produced in India are groundnut, mustard, coconut, sesamum (til), soyabean, castor seeds, cotton seeds, linseed and sunflower. Most of these are edible and used as cooking mediums.

Major cotton-producing states are– Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Kar nataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Jute: It is known as the golden fibre. Jute grows well on well-drained fertile soils in the flood plains where soils are renewed every year. High temperature is required during the time of growth. West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Odisha and Meghalaya are the major jute producing states. It is used in making gunny bags, mats, ropes, yarn, carpets and other artefacts. Due to its high cost, it is losing market to synthetic fibres and packing materials, particularly the nylon. Technological and Institutional Reforms It was mentioned in the previous pages that agriculture has been practised in India for thousands of years. Sustained uses of land without compatible techno-institutional changes have hindered the pace of agricultural development. Inspite of development of sources of irrigation most of the farmers in large parts of the country still depend upon monsoon and natural fertility in order to carry on their agriculture. For a growing population, this poses a serious challenge. Agriculture which provides livelihood for more than 60 per cent of its population, needs some serious technical and institutional reforms. Thus, collectivisation, consolidation of holdings, cooperation and abolition of zamindari, etc. were given priority to bring about institutional reforms in the country after Independence. ‘Land reform’ was the main focus of our First Five Year Plan. The right of inheritance had already lead to fragmentation of land holdings necessitating consolidation of holdings. The laws of land reforms were enacted but the implementation was lacking or lukewarm. The Government of India embarked upon introducing agricultural reforms to improve Indian agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s.

The programme has been in formal existence since 1988 when the state of Odisha passed the first resolution for Joint Forest Management. 5 marks each   Joint Forest Management depends on the formation of local  institutions that undertake protection activities mostly on degraded forest land managed by the forest department. In return, the members of these communities are entitled to intermediary benefits like non-timber forest produces and share in the timber harvested by ‘successful protection’.","The famous Chipko movement in the Himalayas has not only successfully resisted deforestation in several areas but has also shown that community afforestation with indigenous species can be enormously successful. Attempts to revive the traditional conservation methods or developing new methods of ecological farming are now widespread. Farmers and citizen’s groups like the Beej Bachao Andolan in Tehri and Navdanya have shown that adequate levels of diversified crop production without the use of synthetic chemicals are possible and economically viable. In India joint forest management (JFM) programme furnishes a good example for involving local communities in the management and restoration of degraded forests. The programme has been in formal existence since 1988 when the state of Odisha passed the first resolution for joint forest management. JFM depends on the formation of local (village) institutions that undertake protection activities mostly on degraded forest land managed by the forest department. In return, the members of these communities are entitled to intermediary benefits like nontimber forest produces and share in the timber harvested by ‘successful protection’. The clear lesson from the dynamics of both environmental destruction and reconstruction in India is that local communities everywhere have to be involved in some kind of natural resource management. But there is still a long way to go before local communities are at the centrestage in decision-making. Accept only those economic or developmental activities, that are people centric, environment-friendly and economically rewarding.

Q. 1. Describe any five distinct characteristics of ‘Arid soils’. ,"Ans.  Red to brown in colour.  Sandy in texture. Evaporation is faster, soil lacks humus and moisture.  Soil occupied by Kankar.  Kankar restricts the infiltration of water.  1 × 5 = 5","vegetation and in semi-arid environment, it is generally humus poor. They are prone to erosion and degradation due to their position on the landscape. After adopting appropriate soil conservation techniques particularly in the hilly areas of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, this soil is very useful for growing tea and coffee. Red laterite soils in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala are more suitable for crops like cashew nut. Arid Soils
 Arid soils range from red to brown in colour. They are generally sandy in texture and saline in nature. In some areas the salt content is very high and common salt is obtained by evaporating the water. Due to the dry climate, high temperature, evaporation is faster and the soil lacks humus and moisture. The lower horizons of the soil are occupied by Kankar because of the increasing calcium content downwards. The Kankar layer formations in the bottom horizons restrict the infiltration of water. After proper irrigation these soils become cultivable as has been in the case of western Rajasthan.

Q. 2. Why is soil considered as a resource ? Explain with five arguments. ,Ans.  Soil is considered as a resource because it is used to satisfy our needs.  It is the most important renewable natural resource.  It is the medium of plant growth.  It supports different types of living organisms on the earth.  It is the base of our life.  5,"Soil is the most important renewable natural resource. It is the medium of plant growth and supports different types of living organisms on the earth. The soil is a living system. It takes millions of years to form soil upto a few cm in depth. Relief, parent rock or bed rock, climate, vegetation and other forms of life and time are important factors in the formation of soil.

Q. 3. Explain the two types of soil erosion mostly observed in India. Explain three human activities responsible for soil erosion. ,"Ans.		Types of Soil Erosion :  Gullies : The running water cuts through the clayey soils and makes deep channels/gullies. The unfit land caused by gullies is called bad land or ravines.  Sheet erosion : Water flows as a sheet over large areas down a slope. The top soil is washed away. This process is known as sheet erosion. Two human activities which are responsible for the process of soil erosion are deforestation and overgrazing, mining, construction, etc.   1+2=3","of Himalayas, these soils experience denudation and are acidic with low humus content. The soils found in the lower parts of the valleys particularly on the river terraces and alluvial fans are fertile. Soil Erosion and Soil Conservation The denudation of the soil cover and subsequent washing down is described as soil erosion. The processes of soil formation and erosion, go on simultaneously and generally there is a balance between the two. Sometimes, this balance is disturbed due to human activities like deforestation, over-grazing, construction and mining etc., while natural forces like wind, glacier and water lead to soil erosion. The running water cuts through the clayey soils and makes deep channels as gullies. The land becomes unfit for cultivation and is known as bad land. In the Chambal basin such lands are called ravines. Sometimes water flows as a sheet over large areas down a slope. In such cases the top

 Fig. 1.11: Gully Erosion
 soil is washed away. This is known as sheet erosion. Wind blows loose soil off flat or sloping land known as wind erosion. Soil erosion is also caused due to defective methods of farming. Ploughing in a wrong way i.e. up and down the slope form channels for the quick flow of water leading to soil erosion. Ploughing along the contour lines can decelerate the flow of water down the slopes. This is called contour ploughing. Steps can be cut out on the slopes making terraces. Terrace cultivation restricts erosion. Western and central Himalayas have well developed terrace farming. Large fields can be divided into strips. Strips of grass are left to grow between the crops. This breaks up the force of the wind. This method is known as strip cropping. Planting lines of trees to create shelter also works in a similar way. Rows of such trees are called shelter belts. These shelter belts have contributed significantly to the stabilisation of sand dunes and in stabilising the desert in western India.

In our country, women still lag much behind men despite some improvements since Independence. Women face disadvantage, discrimination and oppression in various ways :  The literacy rate among women is only 54 percent as compared with 76 percent among men.  Similarly, a smaller proportion of girl students go for higher studies. Girls are performing as well as boys in school. But they drop out because parents prefer to spend their resources for their boys education rather than spending equally on their sons and daughters.  The proportion of women among the highly paid and valued jobs is still very small. On an average an Indian women works one hour more than an average man everyday.  The Equal Wages Act provides that equal wages should be paid to equal work. However in almost all areas of work, from sports and cinema, to factories and fields, women are paid less than men, even when both do exactly the same work.  In many parts of India, parents prefer to have sons and find ways to have the girl child aborted before she is born. Such sex selective abortion led to a decline in child sex ratio.

Q. 4. What is sexual division of labour ? Mention the main demands of the worldwide women’s agitations ? ,"Ans.		Sexual division of labour means division of work on the basis of the gender difference and according to this concept, all house work and responsibility of bringing up children is women’s work. Women all over the world have been demanding :  Equal voting rights.  Enhancement of political and legal status of women.  Improvement of educational and career opportunities for women.  2+3=5 GENDER, RELIGION AND CASTE","Sexual division of labour: A system in which all work inside the home is either done by the women of the family, or organised by them through the domestic helpers.
 Why are we discussing things like household work in this textbook on Political Science? Is this politics?
 Let us begin with gender division. This is a form of hierarchical social division seen everywhere, but is rarely recognised in the study of politics. The gender division tends to be understood as natural and unchangeable. However, it is not based on biology but on social expectations and stereotypes.
 Boys and girls are brought up to believe that the main responsibility of women is housework and bringing up children. This is reflected in a SEXUAL DIVISION OF LABOUR in most families: women do all work inside the home such as cooking, cleaning, washing clothes, tailoring, looking after children, etc., and men do all the work outside the home. It is not that men cannot do housework; they simply think that it is for women to attend to these things. When these jobs are paid for, men are ready to take up these works. Most tailors or cooks in hotels are men. Similarly, it is not that women do not work outside their home. In villages, women fetch water, collect fuel and work in the fields. In urban areas, poor women work as domestic helper in middle class homes, while middle class women work in offices. In fact the majority of women do some sort of paid work in addition to domestic labour. But their work is not valued and does not get recognition. The result of this division of labour is that although women constitute half of the humanity, their role in public life, especially politics, is minimal in most societies. Earlier, only men were allowed to participate in public affairs, vote and contest for public offices. Gradually the gender issue was raised in politics. Women in different parts of the world organised and agitated for equal rights. There were agitations in different countries for the extension of voting rights to women. These agitations demanded enhancing the political and legal status of women and improving

The main elements of the power-sharing model evolved in Belgium were :  Constitution prescribes that the number of Dutch and French speaking ministers shall be equal in the Central Government. Some special laws require the support of majority of members from each linguistic group. Thus, no single community can make decisions unilaterally. 5 marks each     Many powers of the central government have been given to state governments of the two regions of the country. The state governments are not subordinated to the central government. Brussels had a separate government in which both the communities have equal representation. The French-speaking people accepted equal representation in Brussels because the Dutchspeaking community has accepted equal representation in the central government. Apart from the central and the state government, there is a third kind of government called the Community government.

"Q. 1. Politics and social divisions must not be allowed to mix. Substantiate this statement, with five arguments.  5 marks each  ","Ans.  Democracy involves competition among various political parties. Their competition tends to divide any society.

It was only in 1998, that the UK government and the Nationalists reached a peace treaty after which the nationalists suspended their armed struggle. Political competition along religious and ethnic lines led to the disintegration of Yugoslavia into six independent countries.  In a democracy it is only natural that political parties would talk about the social divisions, make different promises to different communities, look after due representation of various communities and make policies to redress the grievances of the disadvantaged communities.

Or 		 What does the term Communalism mean ? Explain any four forms which communalism takes in politics. ","Ans.		Communalism : It means attempts to promote religious ideas between groups of people which are identified as different communities. 		 Communalism can take various forms in politics :  The most common expression of communalism is in everyday beliefs. These routinely involve religious prejudices, stereotype of religious communities and belief in the superiority of one’s religion over other religions. This is so common that we often fail to notice it, even when we believe in it.  A communal mind often leads to a quest for political dominance of one’s own religious community. For those belonging to majority community, this takes the form of majoritarian dominance. For those belonging to the minority community, it can take the form of a desire to form a separate political unit. GENDER, RELIGION AND CASTE  Political mobilisation on religious lines is another frequent form of communalism. This involves the use of sacred symbols, religious leaders, emotional appeal and plain fear in order to bring the followers of one religion together in the political arena.  Sometimes communalism takes its most ugly form of communal violence, riots and massacre.  1+4=5","Communalism The problem begins when religion is seen as the basis of the nation. The example of Northern Ireland in Chapter 3 shows the dangers of such an approach to nationalism. The problem becomes more acute when religion is expressed in politics in exclusive and partisan terms, when one religion and its followers are pitted against another. This happens when beliefs of one religion are presented as superior to those of other religions, when the demands of one religious group are formed in opposition to another and when state power is used to establish domination of one religious group over the rest. This manner of using religion in politics is communal politics. Communal politics is based on the idea that religion is the principal basis of social community. Communalism involves thinking along the following lines. The followers of a particular religion must belong to one community. Their fundamental interests are the same. Any difference that they may have is irrelevant or trivial for community life. It also follows that people who follow different religions cannot belong to the
 same social community. If the followers of different religion have some commonalities these are superficial and immaterial. Their interests are bound to be different and involve a conflict. In its extreme form communalism leads to the belief that people belonging to different religions cannot live as equal citizens within one nation. Either, one of them has to dominate the rest or they have to form different nations.

In its extreme form communalism leads to the belief that people belonging to different religions cannot live as equal citizens within one nation. Either, one of them has to dominate the rest or they have to form different nations.
 I often crack jokes about people from one religion. Does that make me communal?
 This belief is fundamentally flawed. People of one religion do not have the same interests and aspirations in every context. Everyone has several other roles, positions and identities. There are many voices inside every community. All these voices have a right to be heard. Therefore any attempt to bring all followers of one religion together in context other than religion is bound to suppress many voices within that community. Communalism can take various forms in politics: l The most common expression of communalism is in everyday beliefs.

In electoral politics this often involves special appeal to the interests or emotions of voters of one religion in preference to others. l Sometimes communalism takes its most ugly form of communal violence, riots and massacre. India and Pakistan suffered some of the worst communal riots at the time of the Partition. The post-Independence period has also seen large scale communal violence.

Q. 1. Why did the makers of our Constitution declare India to be a ‘Union of states’ ? Why were some sub-political units of India given a special status?  ,Ans.		India became a Union of states because it consisted of both British–ruled territories as well as many princely states. Some sub-political units of India have a special status.  French and Portuguese–ruled territories were given the status of Union territory.  Jammu & Kashmir joined India on a special condition.  Some units were too small to become independent states. They were made Union Territories.  States in the north-east have been given a special status as they have a large tribal population with a distinct history and culture.  1+4=5,"Let us begin with the Constitution. India had emerged as an independent nation after a painful and bloody partition. Soon after Independence, several princely states became a part of the country. The Constitution declared India as a Union of States. Although it did not use the word federation, the Indian Union is based on the principles of federalism. Let us go back to the seven features of federalism mentioned above. We can see that all these features apply to the provisions of the Indian Constitution. The Constitution originally provided for a two-tier system of government, the Union Government or what we call the Central Government, representing
 16 2020-21
 the Union of India and the State governments. Later, a third tier of federalism was added in the form of Panchayats and Municipalities. As in any federation, these different tiers enjoy separate jurisdiction. The Constitution clearly provided a threefold distribution of legislative powers between the Union Government and the State Governments. Thus, it contains three lists: l Union List includes subjects of national importance such as defence of the country, foreign affairs, banking, communications and currency. They are included in this list because we need a uniform policy on these matters throughout the country. The Union Government alone can make laws relating to the subjects mentioned in the Union List. l State List contains subjects of State and local importance such as police, trade, commerce, agriculture and irrigation. The State Governments

 What about subjects that do not fall in any of the three lists? Or subjects like computer software that came up after the constitution was made? According to our constitution, the Union Government has the power to legislate on these ‘residuary’ subjects. We noted above that most federations that are formed by ‘holding together’ do not give equal power to its constituent units. Thus, all States in the Indian Union do not have identical powers. Some States enjoy a special status. States such as Assam, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram enjoy special powers under certain provisions of the Constitution of India (Article 371) due to their peculiar social and historical circumstances. These special powers are especially enjoyed in relation to the protection of land rights of indigenous peoples, their culture and also preferential employment in government services. Indians who are not permanent residents of this State cannot buy land or house here. Similar special
 provisions exist for some other States of India as well. There are some units of the Indian Union which enjoy very little power. These are areas which are too small to become an independent State but which could not be merged with any of the existing States. These areas, like Chandigarh, or Lakshadweep or the capital city of Delhi, are called Union Territories. These territories do not have the powers of a State. The Central Government has special powers in running these areas. This sharing of power between the Union Government and the State governments is basic to the structure of the Constitution. It is not easy to make changes to this power sharing arrangement. The Parliament cannot on its own change this arrangement. Any change to it has to be first passed by both the Houses of Parliament with at least two-thirds majority. Then it has to be ratified by the legislatures of at least half of the total States. The judiciary plays an important role in overseeing the implementation of constitutional provisions and procedures. In case of any dispute about the division of powers, the High Courts and the Supreme Court make a decision. The Union an d State governments have the power to raise resources by levying taxes in order to carry on the government and the responsibilities assigned to each of them.

Q. 2. Explain any five key features of federalism.  Or 		Describe the main features of federalism.  Or 		Enlist any five features of federalism. 				  Or 		Mention any five main features which makes India a federal country. 			 ,"Ans.		Main Features of Federalism :  There are two or more levels of government. India has three levels.  Each level of government has its own jurisdiction in matters of legislation, taxation and administration even though they govern the same citizens. 5 marks each  Power and functions of each tier of government is specified and guaranteed by Constitution.  The Supreme Court has been given power to settle disputes between federal governments.  Fundamental provisions of Constitution cannot be altered by any one level of government. It applies to India also.  Sources of revenue between different levels is specified by Constitution.  There is mutual trust and agreement between the government at different levels.  1×5=5 ","Let us look at some of the key features of federalism : 1 There are two or more levels (or tiers) of government. 2 Different tiers of government govern the same citizens, but each tier has its own JURISDICTION in specific matters of legislation, taxation and administration. 3 The jurisdictions of the respective levels or tiers of government are specified in the constitution. So the existence and authority of each tier of government is constitutionally guaranteed. 4 The fundamental provisions of the constitution cannot be unilaterally changed by one level of government. Such changes require the consent of both the levels of government. 5 Courts have the power to interpret the constitution and the powers of different levels of government. The highest court acts as an umpire if disputes arise between different levels of government in the exercise of their respective powers. 6 Sources of revenue for each level of government are clearly specified to ensure its financial autonomy.

"Q. 3. Differentiate between ‘Coming Together Federation’ and ‘Holding Together Federation’, with examples. ","Ans. Difference between ‘Coming Together Federation’ and ‘Holding Together Federation’ :  Coming together federation’s are formed when independent states come together to form a bigger state and ‘holding together federations’ are formed when a large country decides to divide itself into sub-units.  In ‘coming together federations’ the state governments are strong, whereas in ‘holding together federations’, the central government is strong.  In ‘coming together federations’, all states governments have equal powers but in ‘holding together federations, this may not be the case.  Examples of coming together federations — U.S.A., Switzerland and Australia. Examples of holding together federations — India, Spain and Belgium.","The exact balance of power between the central and the state government varies from one federation to another. This balance depends mainly on the historical context in which the federation was formed. There are two kinds of routes through which federations have been formed. The first route involves independent States coming together on their own to form a bigger unit, so that by pooling sovereignty and retaining identity they can increase their security. This type of ‘coming together’ federations include the USA, Switzerland and Australia. In this first category of federations, all the constituent States usually have equal power and are strong vis-à-vis the federal government. The second route is where a large country decides to divide its power between the constituent States and the national government. India, Spain and Belgium are examples of this kind of ‘holding together’ federations. In this second categor y, the central government tends to be more powerful vis-à-vis the States. Very often different constituent units of the federation have unequal powers. Some units are granted special powers.
 "
Q. 4. “Holding together federations” do not give equal power to its constituent units. Explain the statement with help of examples in context to India. ,"Ans.  All states in the Indian Union do not have identical powers. For example, Jammu and Kashmir enjoys a special status and has its own constitution.  Many provisions of the Indian Constitution do not apply here.  Indians who are not the permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir cannot buy land or house there.  Smaller units called Union Territories do not have the powers of a state. The Central Government has special powers in running these areas.  1×5=5","We have earlier seen how small countries like Belgium and Sri Lanka face so many problems of managing diversity. What about a vast country like India, with so many languages, religions and regions? What are the power sharing arrangements in our country? Isn’t that strange?

Q. 5. What challenges did centre-state relations in India face before the 1990’s? Why is power sharing between centre and state more effective today ?  Or 		Describe the centre-state relations in Indian Federalism ?  Or How have the centre-state relations been restructured to strengthen federalism ? ,Ans.		Challenges before 1990 :  Political scene was dominated by one party both at the centre and in the states.  States which had government of political parties other than that at the centre were undermined and harassed by the centre even by using constitutional provisions. 		After 1990 :  Now the centre and majority of state governments belong to different political parties in coalition.  A number of regional parties have become powerful and play a crucial role at the centre and states.  The era of “coalition” government at the centre has inculcated respect for federal autonomy.  2+3=5,"Restr ucturing the Centre-State relations is one more way in which federalism has been strengthened in practice. How the constitutional arrangements for sharing power work in reality depends to a large extent on how the ruling parties and leaders follow these arrangements. For a long time, the same party ruled both at the Centre and in most of the States. This meant that the State governments did not exercise their rights as autonomous federal units. As and when the ruling party at the State level was different, the parties that ruled at the Centre tried to undermine the power of the States. In those days, the Central Government would often misuse the Constitution to dismiss the State governments that were controlled by rival parties. This undermined the spirit of federalism.
 Unlike Sri Lanka, the leaders of our country adopted a ver y cautious attitude in spreading the use of Hindi. According to the Constitution, the use of English for official purposes was to stop in 1965. However, many nonHindi speaking States demanded that the use of English continue. In Tamil Nadu, this movement took a violent for m. The Central Gover nment responded by agreeing to continue the use of English along with Hindi for official purposes. Many critics think that this solution favoured the Englishspeaking elite. Promotion of Hindi

Q. 6. How is a federal government different from the unitary form of government ? Why are federations preferred these days ? ,"Ans.		Difference :  Unitary government has only one level of government whereas a federal government has two or more levels of government.  In Unitary government the, sub-units are subordinate to the centre, whereas in a federation, central government cannot encroach on the rights of state governments.  In unitary system, centre can order the sub-units which cannot happen in federation. A Federation is preferred because :  It helps in making administration effective and efficient.  It helps to accommodate all diverse groups.  3+2=5","7 The federal system thus has dual objectives: to safeguard and promote unity of the country, while at the same time accommodate regional diversity. Therefore, two aspects are crucial for the institutions and practice of federalism. Governments at different levels should agree to some rules of power-sharing. They should also trust that each would abide by its part of the agreement. An ideal federal system has both aspects : mutual trust and agreement to live together.
 If federalism works only in big countries, why did Belgium adopt it?
 The exact balance of power between the central and the state government varies from one federation to another. This balance depends mainly on the historical context in which the federation was formed. There are two kinds of routes through which federations have been formed. The first route involves independent States coming together on their own to form a bigger unit, so that by pooling sovereignty and retaining identity they can increase their security. This type of ‘coming together’ federations include the USA, Switzerland and Australia.

Very often different constituent units of the federation have unequal powers. Some units are granted special powers.
 In this sense, federations are contrasted with unitary governments. Under the unitary system, either there is only one level of government or the sub-units are subordinate to the central government. The central government can pass on orders to the provincial or the local government. But in a federal system, the central government cannot order the state government to do something. State government has powers of its own for which it is not answerable to the central government. Both these governments are separately answerable to the people.

Q. 1. How majoritarianism has increased the feeling of alienation among the Sri Lanka Tamils ? Explain.  5 marks each,"Ans. Ans. Sri Lankan Tamils felt alienated because :  Government adopted majoritarian measure to establish Sinhala Supremacy. In 1956, an Act was passed to recognise Sinhala as the only official language thus disregarding Tamil.  The governments followed preferential politics that favoured Sinhala applicants for university positions and government jobs.  A new constitution stipulated that the state shall protect and foster Buddhism.  Srilankan Tamils felt that none of the major political parties by the Buddhist Sinhala leaders were sensitive to their language and culture.

Q. 1. What is development? Why do different people have different developmental goals? Explain with four examples. ,"Ans. Development means continuous progress or increase in real per-capita income. In other words, there is improvement in economic welfare of the people and their standard of living. The four characteristics of development are :  Developmental goals are different for different people.  What may be development for one may not be development for the other.  For development people look at a mix of goals.  Different persons could have different as well as conflicting notions of country’s development. 		  1 + 4 = 5","DEVELOPMENT The idea of development or progress has always been with us. We have aspirations or desires about what we would like to do and how we would like to live. Similarly, we have ideas about what a country should be like. What are the essential things that we require? Can life be better for all? How should people live together? Can there be more equality? Development involves thinking about these questions and about the ways in which we can work towards achieving these goals. This is a complex task and in this chapter we shall make a beginning at understanding development. You will learn more about these issues in greater depth in higher classes. Also, you will find answers to many of these questions not just in economics but also in your course in history and political science. This is because the way we live today is influenced by the past. We can’t desire for change without being aware of this. In the same way, it is only through a democratic political process that these hopes and possibilities can be achieved in real life.
 Similarly, for development, people look at a mix of goals. It is true that if women are engaged in paid work, their dignity in the household and society increases. However, it is also the case that if there is respect for women there would be more sharing of housework and a greater acceptance of women working outside. A safe and secure environment may allow more women to take up a variety of jobs or run a business. Hence, the developmental goals that people have are not only about better income but also about other important things in life.
 LET’S WORK THESE OUT 1. Why do different persons have different notions of development? Which of the following explanations is more important and why? (a) Because people are different. (b) Because life situations of persons are different. 2. Do the following two statements mean the same? Justify your answer. (a) People have different developmental goals. (b) People have conflicting developmental goals. 3. Give some examples where factors other than income are important aspects of our lives. 4. Explain some of the important ideas of the above section in your own words.

Q. 2. Explain with reasons why state of Punjab with a very high per capita income has a very low literacy rate.  ,"Ans.  Per capita income of Punjab is ` 26 ,000 and Kerala is ` 22,800.  Literacy rate of Punjab according to 2001 census is 70% and Kerala is 91%, i.e., Punjab lags behind Kerala.  Therefore, income by itself is not a completely adequate indicator of material goods and services that citizens are able to use.

"Q. 4. It is not an adequate indicator because : It does not tell us how this income is distributed. Per capita Income might not be the income of every individual in the state. Life expectancy and Infant Mortality Rate are other important criteria for measuring development. Education and literacy level are other indicators of development. Pollution free environment, less corruption, gender equality etc. are also important.  1+1+3=5 How has the World Development Report classified countries ? What are the limitations of this report ? ","Ans.  World Bank classifies countries according to the Per Capita Income.  Countries with PCI of more than US $ 12616 per annum and above are called rich countries.  Countries with PCI less than US $ 1035 are called poor countries.  Countries with income between US $ 1530 per annum are called low middle income countries. The limitations of this report are :  It considers only income and not other aspects such as literacy, health, life expectancy, etc.  World Development Report  only tells about income and not how it is distributed among the citizens.  3+2=5","more developed than others with less income. This is based on the understanding that more income means more of all things that human beings need. Whatever people like, and should have, they will be able to get with greater income. So, greater income itself is considered to be one important goal. Now, what is the income of a country? Intuitively, the income of the country is the income of all the residents of the country. This gives us the total income of the country. However, for comparison between countries, total income is not such an useful measure. Since, countries have different populations, comparing total income will not tell us what an average person is likely to earn. Are people in one country better off than others in a different country? Hence, we compare the average income which is the total income of the country divided by its total population. The average income is also called per capita income. In World Development Reports, brought out by the World Bank, this criterion is used in classifying countries. Countries with per capita income of US$ 12,056 per annum and above in 2017, are called rich countries and those with per capita income of US$ 955 or less are called low-income countries. India comes in the category of low middle income countries because its per capita income in 2017 was just US$ 1820 per annum. The rich countries, excluding countries of Middle East and certain other small countries, are generally called developed countries.
 COUNTRY WITH NO RICH AND NO POOR
 assured of being its fifth citizen but if it is a lottery that decides our citizenship number then perhaps most of us will prefer to live in country A. Even though both the countries have identical average income, country A is preferred because it has more equitable distribution. In this country people are neither very rich nor extremely poor. On the other hand most citizens in country B are poor and one person is extremely rich. Hence, while average income is useful for comparison it does not tell us how this income is distributed among people.

Which state has the highest per capita income and why ?  Which state has highest infant mortality and why ?,"Ans.  Kerala : 91%  Punjab : ` 26,000. Reason : Developed infrastructural facilities.  Bihar. Reason : The state lacks health facilities.  1+2+2 = 5","income and Bihar is at the bottom. This means that, on an average, a person in Haryana earned Rs 1,80,174 in one year whereas, on an average, a person in Bihar earned only around Rs 34,409. So, if per capita income were to be used as the measure of development, Haryana will be considered the most developed and Bihar the least developed state of the three. Now, let us look at certain other data pertaining to these states given in Table 1.4.

Q. 6. Why do we use averages to compare the development of countries ? What are the limitations in using it ? Explain. ,"Ans. Use of averages to compare development :  Averages are used for better understanding.  For comparison between countries, total income is not very useful.  Different countries have different populations, so total income will not tell us what an average person is likely to earn.  According to the World Bank, countries with per capita income of US $ 12616 per annum and above in 2012 are called rich countries, and those below US $ 1035 per annum or less are poor. Limitation : Average income does not depict how the income is distributed among the people. Some may be very rich but the masses may be poor.  4+1=5","more developed than others with less income. This is based on the understanding that more income means more of all things that human beings need. Whatever people like, and should have, they will be able to get with greater income. So, greater income itself is considered to be one important goal. Now, what is the income of a country? Intuitively, the income of the country is the income of all the residents of the country. This gives us the total income of the country. However, for comparison between countries, total income is not such an useful measure. Since, countries have different populations, comparing total income will not tell us what an average person is likely to earn. Are people in one country better off than others in a different country? Hence, we compare the average income which is the total income of the country divided by its total population. The average income is also called per capita income. In World Development Reports, brought out by the World Bank, this criterion is used in classifying countries. Countries with per capita income of US$ 12,056 per annum and above in 2017, are called rich countries and those with per capita income of US$ 955 or less are called low-income countries. India comes in the category of low middle income countries because its per capita income in 2017 was just US$ 1820 per annum. The rich countries, excluding countries of Middle East and certain other small countries, are generally called developed countries.

Q. 7. What is development ? What are the indicators used by UNDP for measuring development ? Compare it with the World Bank report. ,"Ans.  Development refers to the process as a result of which along with increase in real per-capita income, there is improvement in the economic welfare and well-being of people.  The UNDP has taken :  education,  health and  per capita income as the indicators.  Compared to the World Bank Report :  It is a broader concept of development.  Countries have been ranked and goals other than level of income are being taken into account.  3+2=5","DEVELOPMENT The idea of development or progress has always been with us. We have aspirations or desires about what we would like to do and how we would like to live. Similarly, we have ideas about what a country should be like. What are the essential things that we require? Can life be better for all? How should people live together? Can there be more equality? Development involves thinking about these questions and about the ways in which we can work towards achieving these goals. This is a complex task and in this chapter we shall make a beginning at understanding development. You will learn more about these issues in greater depth in higher classes. Also, you will find answers to many of these questions not just in economics but also in your course in history and political science. This is because the way we live today is influenced by the past. We can’t desire for change without being aware of this. In the same way, it is only through a democratic political process that these hopes and possibilities can be achieved in real life.
 HOW TO COMPARE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OR STATES? You might ask if development can mean different things, how come some countries are generally called developed and others under developed? Before we come to this, let us consider another question. When we compare different things, they could have similarities as well as differences. Which aspects do we use to compare them? Let us look at students in the class itself. How do we compare different students? They differ in their height, health, talents and interests. The healthiest student may not be the most studious one. The most intelligent student may not be the friendliest one. So, how do we compare students? The criterion we may use depends on the purpose of comparison. We use different criterion to choose a sports team, a debate team, a music team or a team to organise a picnic. Still, if for some purpose, we have to choose the criterion for the all-round progress of children in the class, how shall we do it? Usually we take one or more important characteristics of persons and compare them based on these characteristics. Of course, there can be differences about what are important characteristics that should form the basis of comparison: friendliness and spirit of cooperation, creativity or marks secured? This is true of development too. For comparing countries, their income is considered to be one of the most important attributes. Countries with higher income are
 8
 more developed than others with less income. This is based on the understanding that more income means more of all things that human beings need. Whatever people like, and should have, they will be able to get with greater income. So, greater income itself is considered to be one important goal. Now, what is the income of a country? Intuitively, the income of the country is the income of all the residents of the country. This gives us the total income of the country. However, for comparison between countries, total income is not such an useful measure. Since, countries have different populations, comparing total income will not tell us what an average person is likely to earn. Are people in one country better off than others in a different country? Hence, we compare the average income which is the total income of the country divided by its total population. The average income is also called per capita income. In World Development Reports, brought out by the World Bank, this criterion is used in classifying countries. Countries with per capita income of US$ 12,056 per annum and above in 2017, are called rich countries and those with per capita income of US$ 955 or less are called low-income countries.

"Q. 1. Describe any five conditions or aspects that you would consider before accepting a job.  Or 		If you get a job in a far off place before accepting it, you would try to consider many factors. Explain any five such factors.  Or 		Give examples to prove that there are other important developmental goals than income. ","Ans. If one gets a job in a far off place, before accepting it one would try to consider many factors, apart from income such as :  Facilities for the family : I would have to check if there is good educational facility for children, a good house and locality to stay in, good medical facilities should also be available.  Job security : I should have clear terms of employment in my appointment letter. A job which gives high pay but no job security will reduce one’s sense of security and freedom.  Opportunity to learn : There should be opportunity for personal career growth, so that no boredom or stagnation sets in.  Working atmosphere needs to be cooperative and healthy : There should be good team spirit and the seniors should look after the newcomers and guide them. If women are engaged in paid work, their dignity in the household and society increases. A safe and secured environment may allow more women to take up jobs or run a business.  Time for your family : Working hours should be fixed and adhered to so that there is time for spending with family. Leave facility must be there as well.  1×5=5","More days of work and better wages; local school is able to provide quality education for their children; there is no social discrimination and they too can become leaders in the village.
 Prosperous farmers from Punjab
 Assured a high family income through higher support prices for their crops and through hardworking and cheap labourers; they should be able to settle their children abroad.
 However, it will be wrong to conclude that what cannot be measured is not important. Consider another example. If you get a job in a far off place, before accepting it you would try to consider many factors, apart from income, such as facilities for your family, working atmosphere, or opportunity to learn. In another case, a job may give you less pay but may offer regular employment that enhances your sense of security. Another job, however, may offer high pay but no job security and also leave no time for your family. This will reduce your sense of security and freedom.
 Similarly, for development, people look at a mix of goals. It is true that if women are engaged in paid work, their dignity in the household and society increases. However, it is also the case that if there is respect for women there would be more sharing of housework and a greater acceptance of women working outside. A safe and secure environment may allow more women to take up a variety of jobs or run a business. Hence, the developmental goals that people have are not only about better income but also about other important things in life.
 "
Q. 2. Explain with examples that there are other important development goals also besides income.  Or 		“Developmental goals are different for different people”. Explain the statement with appropriate examples. ,Ans.  Development or progress does not mean one and same thing for every individual. Each individual has his/her own notion of development. For example : Every human being has a basic right to get a good education and better health facilities. Those countries which provide the basic necessities of life progress faster than those countries which do not have these facilities. 5 marks each     ,"DEVELOPMENT The idea of development or progress has always been with us. We have aspirations or desires about what we would like to do and how we would like to live. Similarly, we have ideas about what a country should be like. What are the essential things that we require? Can life be better for all? How should people live together? Can there be more equality? Development involves thinking about these questions and about the ways in which we can work towards achieving these goals.

 LET’S WORK THESE OUT 1. Why do different persons have different notions of development? Which of the following explanations is more important and why? (a) Because people are different. (b) Because life situations of persons are different. 2. Do the following two statements mean the same? Justify your answer. (a) People have different developmental goals. (b) People have conflicting developmental goals. 3. Give some examples where factors other than income are important aspects of our lives. 4. Explain some of the important ideas of the above section in your own words.
 NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT If, as we have seen above, individuals seek different goals, then their notion of national development is also likely to be different. Discuss among yourselves on what India should do for development. Most likely, you would find that different students in the class have given different answers to the above question. In fact, you might yourself think of many different answers and not be too sure of any of these. It is very important to keep in mind that
 "
"Q. 3. People seek things that are most important for them, i.e. things that can fulfil their aspiration or desires. Examples : Development for a farmer might be proper irrigation facilities. For an urban youth, it may be employment. For a landless labourer, it may be land. For a girl, it might mean gender equality or more freedom.   2+3=5 Besides income, what can be the other attributes to compare economic development ? ","Ans. Income is not only the criterion but it is one of the important indicators of economic development. Some of the others attributes are :  Infant Mortality Rate : It is an indicator of the availability of doctors and medical facilities in the region as well the awareness of the people living there in regard to diseases and their prevention. Low infant mortality rate indicates good medical facilities and all round development in the society. A high rate will be an economic loss for the region as much effort is wasted, which could have been harnessed.  Literacy Rate : This is an indicator of the number of schools and teachers available in a region and also indicates whether the facilities are being used or not due to societal pressures. Low literacy rate shows backwardness and there will not be fast economic development.  Life Expectancy : This is also an indicator of available health facilities. Low life expectancy will be a hindrance to economic development.  5","HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPOR T REPORT Once it is realised that even though the level of income is important, yet it is an inadequate measure of the level of development, we begin to think of other criterion. There could be a long list of such criterion but then it would not be so useful. What we need is a small number of the most important things. Health and education indicators, such as the ones we used in comparison of Kerala and Haryana, are among them. Over the past decade or so, health and education indicators have come to be widely used along with income as a measure of development. For instance, Human Development Report published by UNDP compares countries based on the educational levels of the people, their health status and per capita income. It would be interesting to look at certain relevant data regarding India and its neighbours from Human Development Report 2019.

Q. 4. How far is it correct to say that money in your pocket cannot buy the basic needs to live well ? Explain. ,"Ans.  Income by itself is not a completely adequate indicator.  Money cannot buy you a pollution free environment.  Money may also not be able to protect you from infectious diseases. Therefore, the whole community needs to take preventive steps, i.e. :  Collective security for the whole society.   Public facilities such as schools. Public Distribution System in some states.  All can only be done collectively and not individually.  3+2=5","PUBLIC FACILITIES How is it that the average person in Haryana has more income than the average person in Kerala but lags behind in these crucial areas? The reason is — money in your pocket cannot buy all the goods and services that you may need to live well. So, income by itself is not a completely adequate indicator of material goods and services that citizens are able to use. For example, normally, your money cannot buy you a pollution-free environment or ensure that you get unadulterated medicines, unless you can afford to shift to a community that already has all these things. Money may also not be able to protect you from infectious diseases, unless the whole of your community takes preventive steps.
 Actually for many of the important things in life the best way, also the cheapest way, is to provide these goods and services collectively. Just think – will it be cheaper to have collective security for the whole locality or for each house to have its own security man? What if no one, other than you, in your village or locality is interested in studying? Would you be able to study? Not unless your parents could afford to send you to some private school elsewhere. So you are actually able to study because many other children also want to study and because many people believe that the government should open schools and provide other facilities so that all children have a chance to study. Even now, in many areas, children, particularly girls, are not able to go to high school because the government/ society has not provided adequate facilities.

"Q. 1. “When a country develops, the contribution of primary sector declines and that of secondary and tertiary sector increases.” Analyse the statement. Or 		Describe the historical changes that have taken place in the sectors of the economy in the developed countries.  ","Ans.  In the initial stages of development, the primary sector was the most important sector of economic activity. As the methods of farming changed and agriculture sector began to prosper, people began to take up other activities.  New methods of manufacturing were introduced, factories came up and started expanding.  The Secondary sector gradually became the most important in total production and employment.  With the development of areas like transport and administration the service sector kept on growing. In the past 100 years, there has been a shift from the secondary to the tertiary sector in developed countries.  The service sector has become the most important in terms of total production and employment. This is the general pattern observed in developed countries.  1 × 5 = 5","Historical Change in Sectors Generally, it has been noted from the histories of many, now developed, countries that at initial stages of development, primary sector was the most important sector of economic activity. As the methods of farming changed and agriculture sector began to prosper, it produced much more food than before. Many people could now take up other activities. There were increasing number of craftpersons and traders. Buying and selling activities increased many times. Besides, there were also transporters, administrators, army etc. However, at this stage, most of the goods produced were natural products from the primary sector and most people were also employed in this sector.
 Over a long time (more than hundred years), and especially because new methods of manufacturing were introduced, factories came up and started expanding. Those people who had earlier worked on farms now began to work in factories in large numbers. They were forced to do so as you read in history chapters. People began to use many more goods that were produced in factories at cheap rates. Secondary sector gradually became the most important in total production and employment. Hence, over time, a shift had taken place. This means that the importance of the sectors had changed. In the past 100 years, there has been a further shift from secondary to tertiary sector in developed countries. The service sector has become the most important in terms of total production. Most of the working people are also employed in the service sector. This is the general pattern observed in developed countries. What is the total production and employment in the three sectors in India? Over the years have there been changes similar to the pattern observed for the developed countries? We shall see in the next section.
 Rising Importance of the Tertiary Sector in Production Over the forty years between 1973-74 and 2013-14, while production in all the three sectors has increased, it has increased the most in the tertiary sector. As a result, in the year 2013-14, the tertiary sector has emerged as the largest producing sector in India replacing the primary sector.
 24
 Why is the tertiary sector becoming so important in India? There could be several reasons. First, in any country several services such as hospitals, educational institutions, post and telegraph services, police stations, courts, village administrative offices, municipal corporations, defence, transport, banks, insurance companies, etc. are required. These can be considered as basic services. In a developing country the government has to take responsibility for the provision of these services. Second, the development of agriculture and industry leads to the development of services such as
 "
"Q. 2. There has been a big change in the three sectors of economic activities, but a similar shift has not taken place in the share of employment. Explain the above statement on the basis of facts.  ","Ans.  Industrial output has increased by 8 times but employment in the sector has increased only by 2-5 times.  In the tertiary sector, the production of services rose by 11 times but employment in the services rose only by 3 times.  More than half of the workers in the country are working in the primary sector producing only one quarter of the goods.  Secondary and tertiary sectors produce three fourths of the produce whereas they only employ half of the country’s workers.  Primary sector has disguised employment whereas workers in secondary and tertiary sectors work overtime. ","though industrial output or the production of goods went up by more than nine times during the period, employment in the industry went up by around three times. The same applies to the tertiary sector as well. While production in the service sector rose by 14 times, employment in the service sector rose around five times. As a result, more than half of the workers in the country are working in the primary sector, mainly in agriculture, producing only about one sixth of the GDP. In contrast to this, the secondary and tertiary sectors produce the rest of the produce whereas they employ less about half the people. Does this mean that the workers in agriculture are not producing as much as they could? What it means is that there are more people in agriculture than is necessary. So, even if you move a few people out, production will not be affected. In other words, workers in the agricultural sector are underemployed. For instance, take the case of a small farmer, Laxmi, owning about two hectares of unirrigated land dependent only on rain and growing crops, like jowar and arhar. All five members of her family work in the plot throughout the year. Why? They have nowhere else to go for work. You will see that everyone is working, none remains idle, but in actual fact, their labour effort gets divided. Each one is doing some work but no one is fully employed. This is the situation of underemployment, where people are apparently working but all of them are made to work less than their potential. This kind of

Q. 3. Define tertiary sector. Describe about the different kinds of people employed in this sector in India. ,"Ans. Tertiary Sector : It helps in the development of the primary and secondary sectors. They provide aid or support for the production process. Different kinds of people employed in this sector because it provides a lots of opportunity for job.  At one end there are a limited number of services that employ highly skilled and educated workers.  At the other end, there are a very large number of workers engaged in services such as small shopkeepers, repair persons, transporters etc.","spin yarn and weave cloth.

After primary and secondary, there is a third category of activities that falls under tertiary sector and is different from the above two. These are activities that help in the development of the primary and secondary sectors. These activities, by themselves, do not produce a good but they are an aid or a support for the production process. For example, goods that are produced in the primary or secondary sector would need to be transported by trucks or trains and then sold in wholesale and retail shops. At times, it may be necessary to store these in godowns. We also may need to talk to others over telephone or send letters (communication) or borrow money from banks (banking) to help production and trade. Transport, storage, communication, banking, trade are some examples of tertiary activities. Since these activities generate services rather than goods, the tertiary sector is also called the service sector. Service sector also includes some essential services that may not directly help in the production of goods. For example, we require teachers, doctors, and those who provide personal services such as washermen, barbers, cobblers, lawyers, and people to do administrative and accounting works. In recent times, certain new services based on information technology such as internet cafe, ATM booths, call centres, software companies etc have become important.

[Board Term 1, 2011  2010 B1]","Ans. Tertiary sector in India has been growing rapidly for a number of reasons :  In a developing country, the government has to take the responsibility for the provision of basic services for example, hospitals, educational institutions, post and telegraph services, police stations, courts, village administrative offices, municipal corporations, defence, transport, banks, insurance companies etc.  The development of agriculture and industry leads to the development of services such as trade, transport, storage etc. Greater the development of the primary and secondary sectors, more would be the demand for such services.  As income levels rise, certain sections of people start demanding many more services, such as eating out, tourism, shopping, private hospitals; private schools, professional training etc. This change was quite sharp in cities, especially in big cities.     Over the past decade or so, certain new services, such as those based on information and communication technology have become important and essential. Government policy of privatisation has also led to growth of this sector. A large number of workers are engaged in services, such as small shopkeepers, repair persons, transport persons etc. However, the entire sector has not grown. Large numbers of people engaged as construction workers, maid, peons, small shopkeepers etc. do not find any change in their life.

Q. 6. What is the significance of secondary sector in Indian economy ? How does it help in the economic development of the country ? ,Ans. The significance of secondary sector is that it transforms raw material into commodities. It is the second largest sector of our country. 		Role in Economic development :  Secondary sector uses mechanical power and modern use of labour.  It provides employment to a large number of people.  It also helps in creating self-sufficiency in the country. It produces goods for local and international consumers.,"The secondary sector covers activities in which natural products are changed into other forms through ways of manufacturing that we associate with industrial activity. It is the next step after primary. The product is not produced by nature but has to be made and therefore some process of manufacturing is essential. This could be in a factory, a workshop or at home. For example, using cotton fibre from the plant, we
 spin yarn and weave cloth. Using sugarcane as a raw material, we make sugar or gur. We convert earth into bricks and use bricks to make houses and buildings.

Ground water is over used for agriculture.  Water is drawn from wells and this leaves the underground water-table depleted.  Since water is a renewable resource, we must help in replenishing water.  We would be overusing the resources if use more than what is being replenished.  1×5=5","Example 1: Groundwater in India “Recent evidence suggests that the groundwater is under serious threat of overuse in many parts of the country. About 300 districts have reported a water level decline of over 4 metres during the past 20 years. Nearly one-third of the country is overusing their groundwater reserves. In another 25 years, 60 per cent of the country would be doing the same if the present way of using this resource continues. Groundwater overuse is particularly found in the agriculturally prosperous regions of Punjab and Western U.P., hard rock plateau areas of central and south India, some coastal areas and the rapidly growing urban settlements.” (a) Why groundwater is overused? (b) Can there be development without overuse?

Q. 3. What is Sustainable Development ? Explain any four measures to promote sustainable development. ,Ans. Sustainable development : Development without environmental degradation and with conservation of resources for the future generation. 		Measures to promote sustainable development :  Increased use of renewable resource.  Less use of fossil fuels.  Introduction of organic farming.  Adopting measures to reduce global warming.  1+4=5,"SUSTAINABILITY OF DEVELOPMENT Suppose for the present that a particular country is quite developed. We would certainly like this level of development to go up further or at least be maintained for future generations. This is obviously desirable. However, since the second half of the twentieth century, a number of scientists have been warning that the present type, and levels, of development are not sustainable.
 "
Q. 4. Define Sustainable Development. Write any four features of Sustainable Development. ,"Ans. Sustainable development maybe defined as development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs. 		Features :  It is linked to sustainability since it has to be maintained for future generations.  Resources are need to be used wisely so that they can be replenished. For example, if trees are cut they should also be re-planted and allowed to grow.  Overuse of resources which exhaust them. For example, petroleum. If it is used indiscriminately, it will soon get finished and future generations will have nothing left in their hands.  If development is not sustainable, it will give rise to environmental degradation and become a global problem.  People must be protected against pollution, thereby ensuring their quality of life and health.   1+4=5","SUSTAINABILITY OF DEVELOPMENT Suppose for the present that a particular country is quite developed.

However, since the second half of the twentieth century, a number of scientists have been warning that the present type, and levels, of development are not sustainable.
 Consequences of environmental degradation do not respect national or state boundaries; this issue is no longer region or nation specific. Our future is linked together. Sustainability of development is comparatively a new area of knowledge in which scientists, economists, philosophers and other
 social scientists are working together. In general, the question of development or progress is perennial. At all times as a member of society and as individuals we need to ask where we want to go, what we wish to become and what our goals are. So the debate on development continues.

Q. 5. ‘The earth has enough resources to meet the needs of all but not enough to satisfy the greed of even one person’. How is this statement relevant to the discussion of development ? Explain.  ,"Ans. This statement is given by Mahatma Gandhi :  It means that the earth has abundant resources to satisfy everyone’s needs but in our greed and hurry to develop, we have been recklessly exploiting these resources.  In the name of development, we have indulged in activities such as deforestation, overgrazing, encroachment into forest lands, overuse of ground water, use of plastics, etc.  The exploitation of natural resources not only harms the environment but may cripple the future generations of the development process itself.  If fossil fuels are exhausted, the development of all countries would be at risk.  Thus, there is a need for conservation and judicious use of resources for development.  1×5=5","Non-renewable resources are those which will get exhausted after years of use. We have a fixed stock on earth which cannot be replenished. We do discover new resources that we did not know of earlier. New sources in this way add to the stock.

Look at the table and answer the following questions.
 "
Q. 1. Why is agriculture the most labour absorbing sector in India ? How does disguised unemployment make it worse ? Explain with an example. ,"Ans.  Agriculture is the most labour absorbing sector in India because the secondary and tertiary sectors are still failed to provide more employment opportunities as to a majority of the Indian people, so the people are forced to engage themselves in agriculture.  Disguised unemployment it generally found in agriculture sector. People engaged in farming are generally more than required. Though it seems that they are working in the cultivation of land but actually they are partly employed.  For example : A farmer who has a land of 3 hectare which require only 2 persons for farming related to work but all the 7 family members are engaged in it. If 5 persons out of them are with drawn from the job, the total production will not fall. Therefore, 5 persons will come under the category of disguised unemployment.","though industrial output or the production of goods went up by more than nine times during the period, employment in the industry went up by around three times. The same applies to the tertiary sector as well. While production in the service sector rose by 14 times, employment in the service sector rose around five times. As a result, more than half of the workers in the country are working in the primary sector, mainly in agriculture, producing only about one sixth of the GDP. In contrast to this, the secondary and tertiary sectors produce the rest of the produce whereas they employ less about half the people. Does this mean that the workers in agriculture are not producing as much as they could? What it means is that there are more people in agriculture than is necessary. So, even if you move a few people out, production will not be affected. In other words, workers in the agricultural sector are underemployed. For instance, take the case of a small farmer, Laxmi, owning about two hectares of unirrigated land dependent only on rain and growing crops, like jowar and arhar. All five members of her family work in the plot throughout the year. Why? They have nowhere else to go for work. You will see that everyone is working, none remains idle, but in actual fact, their labour effort gets divided. Each one is doing some work but no one is fully employed. This is the situation of underemployment, where people are apparently working but all of them are made to work less than their potential. This kind of
 26
 underemployment is hidden in contrast to someone who does not have a job and is clearly visible as unemployed. Hence, it is also called disguised unemployment. Now, supposing a landlord, Sukhram, comes and hires one or two members of the family to work on his land. Laxmi’s family is now able to earn some extra income through wages. Since you do not need five people to look after that small plot, two people moving out does not affect production on their farm. In the above example, two people may move to work in a factory. Once again the earnings of the family would increase and they would also continue to produce as much from their land. There are lakhs of farmers like Laxmi in India. This means that even if we remove a lot of people from agricultural sector and provide them with proper work elsewhere, agricultural production will not suffer. The incomes of the people who take up other work would increase the total family income. This underemployment can also happen in other sectors. For example there are thousands of casual workers in the service sector in urban areas who search for daily employment. They are employed as painters, plumbers, repair persons and others doing odd jobs. Many of them don’t find work everyday. Similarly, we see other people of the service sector on the street pushing a cart or selling something where they may spend the whole day but earn very little. They are doing this work because they do not have better opportunities.

Q. 2. Describe the estimates of Planning Commission to create jobs in tourism and education ? ,"Ans. Regarding jobs in Schools :  Planning commission estimates that nearly 20 lakh jobs can be created in education sector alone.  For more children to attend school, more teachers and more infrastructure will be required. Regarding jobs in Tourism :  Planning commission estimates that nearly 35 lakh jobs can be created in tourism sector.  Regional crafts and Cottage industry can also create jobs.  New services such as IT also are job generators.","many of them may be working as child labourers. If these children are to attend schools, we will require more buildings, more teachers and other staff. A study conducted by the erstwhile Planning Commission (now known as NITI Aayog) estimates that nearly 20 lakh jobs can be created in the education sector alone. Similarly, if we are to improve the health situation, we need many more doctors, nurses, health workers etc. to work in rural areas. These are some ways by which jobs would be created and we would also be able to address the important aspects of development talked about in Chapter 1. Every state or region has potential for increasing the income and employment for people in that area. It could be tourism, or regional craft industry, or new services like IT. Some of these would require proper planning and support from the government. For example, the same study by the Planning Commission says that if tourism as a sector is improved, every year we can give additional employment to more than 35 lakh people. We must realise that some of the suggestions discussed above would take a long time to implement. For the short-term, we need some quick measures. Recognising this, the central government in India made a law implementing the Right to Work
 "
Q. 3. What is GDP? Explain the process to calculate GDP. ,"Ans.  Gross Domestic Product or GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country, during a particularly year.  The sum of production in the three sectors give us the GDP . The money values of goods and services should be added rather than adding up the actual numbers. The value of final goods alone should be added as the value of intermediate goods is already included in the value of final goods. This mammoth task of measuring GDP is undertaken by the Central Government Ministry. This organization collects information relating to the total volume of goods and services and their prices and then estimates the GDP. 5 marks each","separately is therefore not correct because then we would be counting the value of the same things a number of times. First as wheat, then as flour and finally as biscuits. The value of final goods and services produced in each sector during a particular year provides the total production of the sector for that year. And the sum of production in the three sectors gives what is called the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country. It is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a particular year. GDP shows how big the economy is. In India, the mammoth task of measuring GDP is undertaken by a central government ministry. This Ministry, with the help of various government departments of all the Indian states and union territories, collects information relating to total volume of goods and services and their prices and then estimates the GDP.
 "
Q. 4. How can we create more employment in secondary and tertiary sectors in rural India ?,Ans.       We can create more jobs in the secondary sector by promoting industries such as dal mills. By promoting cottage and handicraft industries to employ the villagers. By tying up industries to promote processing of vegetables and fruits. Government can invest in cold storages. Services like transportation and communication must be promoted to generate employment. Building Multi-purpose Projects can create employment.,"How to Create More Employment? From the above discussion, we can see that there continues to be considerable underemployment in agriculture. There are also people who are not employed at all. In what ways can one increase employment for people? Let us look at some of them. Take the case of Laxmi with her two-hectare plot of unirrigated land. The government can spend some money or banks can provide a loan, to construct a well for her family to irrigate the land. Laxmi will then be able to irrigate her land and take a second crop, wheat, during the rabi season. Let us suppose that one hectare of wheat can provide employment to two people for 50 days (including sowing, watering, fertiliser
 "
Q. 5. How can we create more employment opportunities in urban areas ? Explain with examples. ,"Ans. Ways to increase employment opportunities in urban areas :  If credit is provided cheaply and easily, it will encourage the setting up of small-scale business, or self-employment.  If educational facilities are improved and schools are set up more jobs in education line will be created and those educated will also find jobs.  By improving health facilities, setting up hospitals in rural and urban areas employment will be generated in the health sector.  Tourism must be promoted so that ancillary business generated will bring employment.  Small scale industries must be encouraged and developed.  1 × 5 =5","Another way by which we can tackle this problem is to identify, promote and locate industries and services in semi-rural areas where a large number of people may be employed. For instance, suppose many farmers decide to grow arhar and chickpea (pulse crops). Setting up a dal mill to procure and process these and sell in the cities is one such example. Opening a cold storage could give an opportunity for farmers to store their products like potatoes and onions and sell them when the price is good. In villages near forest areas, we can start honey collection centres where farmers can come and sell wild honey. It is also possible to set up industries that process vegetables and agricultural produce like potato, sweet potato, rice, wheat, tomato, fruits, which can be sold in outside markets. This will provide employment in industries located in semi-rural areas and not necessarily in large urban centres.
 "
Q. 6. Explain measures that can be adopted to remove disguised unemployment in the agriculture sector. ,"Ans. When more people are compelled to do a job which only few can do, then such a situation is termed as disguised unemployment.  One or two members of farmer’s family can work in the farms of big landlord and earn wages.  Two or three members of such a family may move to work in a nearby factory and earn more money.  More irrigational facilities can be provided to grow two or three crops in a year.  ","though industrial output or the production of goods went up by more than nine times during the period, employment in the industry went up by around three times. The same applies to the tertiary sector as well. While production in the service sector rose by 14 times, employment in the service sector rose around five times.

Q. 8. Explain the meaning of disguised unemployment with the help of any two suitable examples. ,"Ans. Disguised unemployment : When the people are working in any field for more than their labour necessity. For example, where the need is for 4 labourers and 7 labourers are working, it means 3 labourers are suffering from disguised unemployment or under-employment. In such a case, the production will not be affected even if the three extra labour do not work. 		Examples :  In rural India, agricultural field is suffering from this type of unemployment. More than half of the workers in the country are working in primary sector mainly in agricultural activities producing only a quarter of G.D.P.  In urban areas, workers like painters, plumbers, repair persons, cart drivers do not find work every day or for the whole day.","though industrial output or the production of goods went up by more than nine times during the period, employment in the industry went up by around three times.

Q. 1. Differentiate between organised and unorganised sector.  		Compare the employment conditions prevailing in the organised and the unorganised sector ?  ,"Ans. Organised Sector :  It is the one where the terms of employment are regular and people have assured work.  They are registered by the government and have to follow its rules and regulations which are given in various laws such as the factories Act, Minimum Wages Act etc.  It is called organised because it has some processed and procedures.  Workers in the organised sector enjoy security of employment. They are expected to work only a fix number of hours. If they work more, they have to be paid overtime by the employer.  They also get several other benefits from the employers like paid leave, payment during holidays, provident fund, pensions, gratuity, medical benefits etc. 		Unorganised Sector :  These are small and scattered units which are largely outside the control of the government.  There are rules and regulations but these are not followed.  Jobs here are low-paid and often not regular.  Employment is not secure as people can be asked to leave without any reason.  There is no provision for overtime, paid leave, holidays, leave due to sickness etc. Examples :  In a developing country, the government has to take the responsibility for the provision of basic services for example, hospitals, educational institutions, post and telegraph services, police stations, courts, village administrative offices, municipal corporations, defence, transport, banks, insurance companies etc.  The development of agriculture and industry leads to the development of services such as trade, transport, storage etc. Greater the development of the primary and secondary sectors, more would be the demand for such services.  As income levels rise, certain sections of people start demanding many more services, such as  5 marks each eating out, tourism, shopping, private hospitals; private schools, professional training, etc. This change was quite sharp in cities, especially in big cities.  Over the past decade or so, certain new services, such as those based on information and communication technology have become important and essential.  Government policy of Privatisation has also led to growth of this sector.  A large number of workers are engaged in services, such as small shopkeepers, repair persons, transport persons, etc.  However, the entire sector has not grown. Large numbers of people engaged as construction workers, maid, peons, small shopkeepers etc. do not find any change in their life.  1 × 5 = 5","LET’S WORK THESE OUT 1. Look at the following examples. Which of these are unorganised sector activities? (i) A teacher taking classes in a school (ii) A headload worker carrying a bag of cement on his back in a market (iii) A farmer irrigating her field (iv) A doctor in a hospital treating a patient (v) A daily wage labourer working under a contractor (vi) A factory worker going to work in a big factory (vii) A handloom weaver working in her house 2.

Q. 2. “Workers are not exploited in organised sector”. Do you agree with the statement ? Explain reasons in support of your answer.  Or 		 What is unorganised sector ? Describe the working procedure of this sector.  Or 		Workers are exploited in an unorganised sector. Do you agree with this statement ? Justify your answer with five relevant points.  Or 		Define the term ‘Unorganised Sector’. Mention any six disadvantages of working in this sector. ,"Ans. Unorganised Sector : Unorganized sector is a sector which has small and scattered units largely outside the control of the government. Yes, workers are exploited in the unorganised sector. Reasons are as follows :  There are no rules and regulations followed.  Jobs are low paid and often not regular  No provision of overtime is there and no paid holidays or leave is given.  Employment is not secure. People can be asked to leave without reason.  Some kind of work is seasonal in nature and temporary workers are employed. They become unemployed after the season is over.  No other facilities like Provident Fund, Gratuity or sick leave are given.  Working conditions are often poor. No allowances are given.  No medical benefit is given.  1 + 4 = 5 ","How to Protect Workers in the Unorganised Sector? The organised sector offers jobs that are the most sought-after. But the employment opportunities in the organised sector have been expanding very slowly. It is also common to find many organised sector enterprises in the unorganised sector. They adopt such strategies to evade taxes and refuse to follow laws that protect labourers. As a result, a large number of workers are forced to enter the unorganised sector jobs, which pay a very low salary. They are often exploited and not paid a fair wage. Their earnings are low and not regular. These jobs are not secure and have no other benefits. Since the 1990s, it is also common to see a large number of workers losing their jobs in the organised sector. These workers are forced to take up jobs in the unorganised sector with low earnings. Hence, besides the need for more work, there is also a need for protection and support of the workers in the unorganised sector.
 Who are these vulnerable people who need protection? In the rural areas, the unorganised sector mostly comprises of landless agricultural labourers, small and marginal farmers, sharecroppers and artisans (such as weavers, blacksmiths, carpenters and goldsmiths). Nearly 80 per cent of rural households in India are in small and marginal farmer category. These farmers need to be supported through adequate facility for timely delivery of seeds, agricultural inputs, credit, storage facilities and marketing outlets. In the urban areas, unorganised sector comprises mainly of workers in small-scale industry, casual workers in construction, trade and transport etc., and those who work as street vendors, head load workers, garment makers, rag pickers etc. Small-scale industry also needs government’s support for procuring raw material and marketing of output. The casual workers in both rural and urban areas need to be protected. We also find that majority of workers from scheduled castes, tribes and backward communities find themselves in the unorganised sector. Besides getting the irregular and low paid work, these workers also face social discrimination. Protection and support to the unorganised sector workers is thus necessary for both economic and social development.

Q. 3. Under employment and disguised unemployment are not the same thing. Or 		Explain the meaning of disguised unemployment with the help of any two suitable examples. ,"Ans. Disguised unemployment : When the people are working in any field for more than their labour necessity. For example, where the need is for 4 labourers and 7 labourers are working, it means 3 labourers are suffering from disguised unemployment or under-employment. In such a case, the production will not be affected even if the three extra labour do not work. 		Examples :  In rural India, agricultural a sector is suffering from this type of unemployment. More than half of the workers in the country are working in primary sector mainly in agricultural activities producing only a quarter of G.D.P.  In urban areas, workers like painters, plumbers, repair persons, cart drivers do not find work every day or for the whole day.","though industrial output or the production of goods went up by more than nine times during the period, employment in the industry went up by around three times. The same applies to the tertiary sector as well. While production in the service sector rose by 14 times, employment in the service sector rose around five times. As a result, more than half of the workers in the country are working in the primary sector, mainly in agriculture, producing only about one sixth of the GDP. In contrast to this, the secondary and tertiary sectors produce the rest of the produce whereas they employ less about half the people. Does this mean that the workers in agriculture are not producing as much as they could? What it means is that there are more people in agriculture than is necessary. So, even if you move a few people out, production will not be affected. In other words, workers in the agricultural sector are underemployed. For instance, take the case of a small farmer, Laxmi, owning about two hectares of unirrigated land dependent only on rain and growing crops, like jowar and arhar. All five members of her family work in the plot throughout the year. Why? They have nowhere else to go for work. You will see that everyone is working, none remains idle, but in actual fact, their labour effort gets divided. Each one is doing some work but no one is fully employed. This is the situation of underemployment, where people are apparently working but all of them are made to work less than their potential. This kind of
 26
 underemployment is hidden in contrast to someone who does not have a job and is clearly visible as unemployed. Hence, it is also called disguised unemployment. Now, supposing a landlord, Sukhram, comes and hires one or two members of the family to work on his land. Laxmi’s family is now able to earn some extra income through wages. Since you do not need five people to look after that small plot, two people moving out does not affect production on their farm. In the above example, two people may move to work in a factory. Once again the earnings of the family would increase and they would also continue to produce as much from their land. There are lakhs of farmers like Laxmi in India. This means that even if we remove a lot of people from agricultural sector and provide them with proper work elsewhere, agricultural production will not suffer. The incomes of the people who take up other work would increase the total family income. This underemployment can also happen in other sectors. For example there are thousands of casual workers in the service sector in urban areas who search for daily employment. They are employed as painters, plumbers, repair persons and others doing odd jobs. Many of them don’t find work everyday. Similarly, we see other people of the service sector on the street pushing a cart or selling something where they may spend the whole day but earn very little. They are doing this work because they do not have better opportunities.

 What are the changes that you observe in the primary sector over a span of forty years? 2. Choose the correct answer: Underemployment occurs when people (i) do not want to work (ii) are working in a lazy manner (iii) are working less than what they are capable of doing (iv) are not paid for their work 3. Compare and contrast the changes in India with the pattern that was observed for developed countries. What kind of changes between sectors were desired but did not happen in India? 4. Why should we be worried about underemployment?
 How to Create More Employment? From the above discussion, we can see that there continues to be considerable underemployment in agriculture. There are also people who are not employed at all. In what ways can one increase employment for people? Let us look at some of them. Take the case of Laxmi with her two-hectare plot of unirrigated land. The government can spend some money or banks can provide a loan, to construct a well for her family to irrigate the land. Laxmi will then be able to irrigate her land and take a second crop, wheat, during the rabi season. Let us suppose that one hectare of wheat can provide employment to two people for 50 days (including sowing, watering, fertiliser
