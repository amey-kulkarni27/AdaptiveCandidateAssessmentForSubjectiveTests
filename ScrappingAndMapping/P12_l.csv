Examine any three factors responsible for the US hegemony in the world politics. ,"Three factors responsible for the US hegemony in world Politics: (i) The U.S. Hegemony as a Hard Power • •  • •  The most important factor for the overwhelming superiority of US power is its superiority of its military power. American military dominance is both absolute and relative. In absolute terms, the US has military capabilities that can reach any point on the planet accurately, lethally and in real time. While its own forces are sheltered to the maximum extent possible from the dangers of war. No other power can remotely match US military might. It spends more on its military capability than the next 12 powers combined. The military dominance of the US is not just based on higher military spending, but on the qualitative gap, that no other power can match. (Any two points)  (ii) The US Hegemony as a structural power • •  Hegemony in this second sense is in the role played by the US in providing global public goods – such as the sea lanes of communication (SLOCs) The naval power of the hegemony is another reason for its structural power.  • •  The internet is the direct outcome of a US military research project that began in 1950. There is not a single sector of the world economy in which an American firm does not feature in the ‘top three’ lists. (Any two points)  (iii) The U.S. Hegemony as a soft power. • •  • •  The predominance of the US in the world today is based not only on its military power and economic powers, but also on its cultural presence. All ideas of good life and personal success, most of the dreams of individuals and societies across the globe, are dreams churned out by practices prevailing in 21st century America. America is the most powerful culture on earth. The cool pair of blue jeans is an example of it. The influence of McDonald’s and the KFC is also very visible.

 the adversary while its forces are sheltered to the maximum extent possible from the dangers of war. The absolute capabilities of the US is the fact that no other power today can remotely match them. The US today spends more on its military capability than the next 12 powers combined. Although, the US invasion of Iraq reveals several American vulnerabilities. The US has not been able to force the Iraqi people into submitting to the occupation forces of the US-led coalition. Imperial powers through history have used military forces to accomplish four tasks: to conquer, deter, punish and police. US has been able to succeed in first three tasks. It has won Iraq and has restricted Iraqi powers. Punishment of death to President Hussain and his supporters was given but US military capability has thus far been shown to have serious weaknesses in policing an occupied territory. Q.6. Describe US hegemony as a structural power. Ans. In the world politics, economic power also plays an important role with hard power. It raises political dominance of the country as well. This is known as structural power. The basic idea is that an open world economy requires a hegemony or dominant power to support its creation and existence. The hegemony must possess both the ability and the desire to establish certain norms for order and must sustain the global structure. The hegemony usually does this to its own advantage but often its relative detriment, as its competitors take advantage of the openness of the world economy without paying the costs of maintaining its openness. Hegemony is reflected in the role played by the US in providing global public goods. Public goods are those goods that can be consumed by one person without reducing the goods available for someone else. Fresh air and roads are examples of public goods. In the context of world economies, the best examples of a global public goods are sea-lines of communication, (SLOCs), the sea routes were commonly used by merchant ships. Free trade in an open world economy would not be possible without open SLOCs. Naval power of hegemony underwrites the law of the sea and ensures freedom of navigation in international waters. Since the decline of British naval power after the Second World War, the multi-oceanic US navy has played this role. Another example of a global public good is the Internet. It is the direct outcome of a US military research project, making the virtual world of the World Wide Web possible. US is present in all the sectors of the World economy and in all areas of technology. The US share of the world economy is 28 per cent. The US also accounts for 15 percent of World trade. The Bretton woods system, set up by the US after the Second World War still constitute the basic structure of the world economy. We can regard the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Trade Organisation (WTO) as the products of American hegemony. A classic example of the structural power of the US is the academic degree called Masters in Business Administration (MBA). The idea that business is a profession that depends upon skills that can be taught in a university is uniquely American. The first business school in the world, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, was established in 1881. The first MBA courses were initiated around 1900. The first MBA course outside the US
 was established only in 1950. There is no country in the world today in which the MBA is not a prestigious academic degree. Q.7. Analyse the political impact of hegemony of the US on the world. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Political Impact of the US Hegemony on the World: i. ii. iii. iv. v. vi. vii. viii. ix.
 Now the international system is dominated by a sole superpower, i.e., the US. The US today spends more on its military capability from the next 12 powers combined. Most of the other countries that are big military spenders are US friends and allies. The US Hegemony is reflected in the role played by the US in providing global public goods. SLOCs is under the control of multi-oceanic US Navy. The US also accounts for 15 percent of world trade. World Bank, International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organisation are assumed as the products of American hegemony. The Predominance of the US in the world today is also based on its cultural presence. The US is the most seductive and most powerful culture on earth. (Any six points)

Write an essay on Indo-US relations.,"US administration was sympathetic towards India during the struggle of independence but after independence, when India adopted the policy of non-alignment, bitterness among their relations was seen. The gap widened due to India’s relationship with USSR. After the collapse of USSR, when India could see the whole world was almost under the US hegemony, India changed its foreign policy. America provided military and economic assistance to India during the time of China attack in 1962 and thus, their relationship became cordial. During independence of Bangladesh in 1971, bitterness again emerged among their relationship. But in 1978, India’s visit of American President and America’s visit of Indian President made their relationship cordial. The organisation of India’s festival in America also improved the relationship between both in 1985. US put military and economic restrictions on India after nuclear test was done by India in May 1998. The pressure for signing CTBT on India further widened the gap. The restrictions were taken back by US during Kargil War in May 1999. This improved relationship and after 2000, the relations became cordial in the period of Bill Clinton and Atal Bihari Vajpayi. Both of them had their own interests behind such changes. Due to America’s own trade interests, technology market and continuous emerging power of China, America could not ignore a big country with nuclear power like India. There was a drastic change in the outlook of US after the terrorist attack of 11 September, 2001 on US. It considered India as a real friend for eliminating terrorism. The trade relations between both the countries are deepened. In recent times, America removed import duty from 42 types of goods, which are imported from India which amounts more than approximate 60 crore dollars. American President George W. Bush and Indian Prime Minister Vajpayi made a consent on energy, environment, health, space (weather and communication), export control, science and technology with existence in biotechnology & information technology also to wide the scope of communication. US also helped India in taking loan from World Bank of one arab dollar.","Q.8. Which are the three policies on which there has been a continuous debate within India regarding Indo-US relationships? Ans. Within India, the debate seems to be around three possible strategies: (i) Military power: These Indian analysts who see international politics largely in terms of military power are fearful of the growing closeness between India and the US. They would prefer that India maintains its aloofness from Washington and focuses upon increasing its own comprehensive national power. (ii) Historic Opportunity: Other analysts see the growing convergence of interests between the US and India as a historic opportunity for India. They would advocate a strategy that would allow India to take advantage of US hegemony and the mutual convergences to establish the best possible options for itself. It is a futile strategy that will only hunt India in the long run. (iii) Establishing a Coalition: A third group of analysts would advocate that India should take the lead in establishing a coalition of countries from the developing world. Over time, this coalition would become more powerful and may succeed in weaning the hegemon away from its dominating ways. Q.9. How can Indo-US relationship be understood ? Ans. There are two new factors that have emerged in Indo-US relations in recent years. These factors relate to the technological dimension and the role of Indian-American diaspora. These two factors are interrelated. These can be understood by following facts: • • • •

Write about US hegemony in terms of US Military power. [CBSE (AI) 2013] Or Write about US hegemony as a superpower. [CBSE (AI) 2014],"The term ‘hegemony’ implies the leadership on predominance of one state. The first meaning of hegemony relates to the relations, patterns and balances of military capability between states. The bedrock of contemporary US power lies in the overwhelming superiority of its military power. American military dominance today is both absolute and relative. It can reach any country or state or region, thereby crippling  the adversary while its forces are sheltered to the maximum extent possible from the dangers of war. The absolute capabilities of the US is the fact that no other power today can remotely match them. The US today spends more on its military capability than the next 12 powers combined. Although, the US invasion of Iraq reveals several American vulnerabilities. The US has not been able to force the Iraqi people into submitting to the occupation forces of the US-led coalition.

 Q.7. What do you mean by US hegemony in today’s world? Which two constraints control US hegemony? [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. US hegemony in today’s world politics means dominance of US at global stage. After the Collapse of bipolar world, US has emerged as a sole superpower and unipolar system is established in the world. US hegemony can be seen as hard power, structural power and soft power. It can interfere in any part of the world in its economy and military affairs. There are two constraints on American power: 1. The system of division of American powers among three parts. 2. NATO-NATO is the only organization in International system that could possibly moderate the exercise of American Power today. Q.8. What are the constraints on American hegemony today? Which of these do you expect to get more importance in the future? [NCERT] Or Mention any two constraints that come in the wars of American hegemony. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. History tells us that empires decline because they decay from within. Similarly the biggest constraints to American hegemony lie within the heart of hegemony itself. Although, none of these constraints seemed to operate in the years following 9/11, but it now appears that all three of these constraints are slowly beginning to operate again. These are as follows: (i) Institutional Architecture of America: The first constraint is the institutional architecture of America itself. A system of division of powers between the three branches of the government, places significant breaks upon the unrestrained and immoderate exercise of America’s military power of the executive branch. This isthe best example of constraints on American hegemony today. (ii) Domestic Nature of American Power: The second constraint on American hegemony is internal and domestic nature of American power. Although the American mass media may from time to time impose or promote a particular perspective on domestic public opinion in the US, there is nevertheless a deep skepticism regarding the purposes and methods of government in American political culture. This factor is a huge constraint on US military action overseas. (iii) North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO): NATO is the third most important factor that imposes a constraint on American power in global politics. Clearly, the US
 has an enormous interest in keeping the alliance of democracies that follow the market economies alive and therefore it is possible that its allies in the NATO will be able to moderate the exercise of US hegemony. Q.9. Describe US hegemony as a soft power. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Or ‘US’s hegemony as a soft power cannot be denied.’ Comment. Ans. After the Second World War, America’s cultural superiority along with military and soft power dominance can also be seen. Here, hegemony implies class ascendancy in the social, political and particularly ideological spheres. Hegemony arises when the dominant country can win the consent of dominated classes, by persuading the dominated classes to view the world in a manner favourable to the ascendancy of the dominant class. A dominant power deploys notonly military power but also ideological resources to shape the behavior of competing and lesser powers. Consent, in other words, goes hand-in-hand with, and often more effective than, coercion. The predominance of the US in the world today is based not only on its military power and economic powers, but also on its cultural presence. India’s example can justify this. It is the dream of every literate Indian that he/she wants to go settle in US by any means because they feel their future is secured in US. India is adopting culture, living sense of US. US has been benefitted by this reaction is expanding its dominance. Even during the Cold War, the society of Soviet Union was very much impressed by the improvised of US. The youth of Soviet Union was most impressed by wearing the popular blue jeans. As a result, they used to feel satisfied after purchasing blue jeans from market ever if they spend their yearly income. These blue jeans were not available in their own country. During the Cold War, the US found it difficult to score victories against the Soviet Union in the realm of hard power. It was in the area of structural power and soft power that the US scored notable victories. The interest of citizens of Soviet Union in blue jeans clearly shows this. The US culture is very attractive and is most powerful. It is that aspect of soft power where the country wins the consent of dominated classes.

There is no country in the world today in which the MBA is not a prestigious academic degree.","Hegemony in this second sense is in the role played by the US in providing global public goods – such as the sea lanes of communication (SLOCs) The naval power of the hegemony is another reason for its structural power.
 the adversary while its forces are sheltered to the maximum extent possible from the dangers of war. The absolute capabilities of the US is the fact that no other power today can remotely match them. The US today spends more on its military capability than the next 12 powers combined. Although, the US invasion of Iraq reveals several American vulnerabilities. The US has not been able to force the Iraqi people into submitting to the occupation forces of the US-led coalition. Imperial powers through history have used military forces to accomplish four tasks: to conquer, deter, punish and police. US has been able to succeed in first three tasks. It has won Iraq and has restricted Iraqi powers. Punishment of death to President Hussain and his supporters was given but US military capability has thus far been shown to have serious weaknesses in policing an occupied territory. Q.6. Describe US hegemony as a structural power. Ans. In the world politics, economic power also plays an important role with hard power. It raises political dominance of the country as well. This is known as structural power. The basic idea is that an open world economy requires a hegemony or dominant power to support its creation and existence. The hegemony must possess both the ability and the desire to establish certain norms for order and must sustain the global structure. The hegemony usually does this to its own advantage but often its relative detriment, as its competitors take advantage of the openness of the world economy without paying the costs of maintaining its openness. Hegemony is reflected in the role played by the US in providing global public goods. Public goods are those goods that can be consumed by one person without reducing the goods available for someone else. Fresh air and roads are examples of public goods. In the context of world economies, the best examples of a global public goods are sea-lines of communication, (SLOCs), the sea routes were commonly used by merchant ships. Free trade in an open world economy would not be possible without open SLOCs. Naval power of hegemony underwrites the law of the sea and ensures freedom of navigation in international waters. Since the decline of British naval power after the Second World War, the multi-oceanic US navy has played this role. Another example of a global public good is the Internet. It is the direct outcome of a US military research project, making the virtual world of the World Wide Web possible. US is present in all the sectors of the World economy and in all areas of technology. The US share of the world economy is 28 per cent. The US also accounts for 15 percent of World trade. The Bretton woods system, set up by the US after the Second World War still constitute the basic structure of the world economy. We can regard the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Trade Organisation (WTO) as the products of American hegemony. A classic example of the structural power of the US is the academic degree called Masters in Business Administration (MBA). The idea that business is a profession that depends upon skills that can be taught in a university is uniquely American. The first business school in the world, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, was established in 1881. The first MBA courses were initiated around 1900. The first MBA course outside the US

 Q.7. What do you mean by US hegemony in today’s world? Which two constraints control US hegemony? [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. US hegemony in today’s world politics means dominance of US at global stage. After the Collapse of bipolar world, US has emerged as a sole superpower and unipolar system is established in the world. US hegemony can be seen as hard power, structural power and soft power. It can interfere in any part of the world in its economy and military affairs. There are two constraints on American power: 1. The system of division of American powers among three parts. 2. NATO-NATO is the only organization in International system that could possibly moderate the exercise of American Power today. Q.8. What are the constraints on American hegemony today? Which of these do you expect to get more importance in the future? [NCERT] Or Mention any two constraints that come in the wars of American hegemony. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. History tells us that empires decline because they decay from within. Similarly the biggest constraints to American hegemony lie within the heart of hegemony itself. Although, none of these constraints seemed to operate in the years following 9/11, but it now appears that all three of these constraints are slowly beginning to operate again. These are as follows: (i) Institutional Architecture of America: The first constraint is the institutional architecture of America itself. A system of division of powers between the three branches of the government, places significant breaks upon the unrestrained and immoderate exercise of America’s military power of the executive branch. This isthe best example of constraints on American hegemony today. (ii) Domestic Nature of American Power: The second constraint on American hegemony is internal and domestic nature of American power. Although the American mass media may from time to time impose or promote a particular perspective on domestic public opinion in the US, there is nevertheless a deep skepticism regarding the purposes and methods of government in American political culture. This factor is a huge constraint on US military action overseas. (iii) North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO): NATO is the third most important factor that imposes a constraint on American power in global politics. Clearly, the US
 has an enormous interest in keeping the alliance of democracies that follow the market economies alive and therefore it is possible that its allies in the NATO will be able to moderate the exercise of US hegemony. Q.9. Describe US hegemony as a soft power. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Or ‘US’s hegemony as a soft power cannot be denied.’ Comment. Ans. After the Second World War, America’s cultural superiority along with military and soft power dominance can also be seen. Here, hegemony implies class ascendancy in the social, political and particularly ideological spheres. Hegemony arises when the dominant country can win the consent of dominated classes, by persuading the dominated classes to view the world in a manner favourable to the ascendancy of the dominant class. A dominant power deploys notonly military power but also ideological resources to shape the behavior of competing and lesser powers. Consent, in other words, goes hand-in-hand with, and often more effective than, coercion. The predominance of the US in the world today is based not only on its military power and economic powers, but also on its cultural presence. India’s example can justify this. It is the dream of every literate Indian that he/she wants to go settle in US by any means because they feel their future is secured in US. India is adopting culture, living sense of US. US has been benefitted by this reaction is expanding its dominance. Even during the Cold War, the society of Soviet Union was very much impressed by the improvised of US. The youth of Soviet Union was most impressed by wearing the popular blue jeans. As a result, they used to feel satisfied after purchasing blue jeans from market ever if they spend their yearly income. These blue jeans were not available in their own country. During the Cold War, the US found it difficult to score victories against the Soviet Union in the realm of hard power. It was in the area of structural power and soft power that the US scored notable victories. The interest of citizens of Soviet Union in blue jeans clearly shows this. The US culture is very attractive and is most powerful. It is that aspect of soft power where the country wins the consent of dominated classes.

What makes the European Union a highly influential regional organisation? ,"Following are the factors that make the European union a highly influential regional organisation: (i) Establishment of peace and tranquility: It became clear that war can never prove to be a step in the direction of country’s development. Prosperity and peace can be established by maintaining tranquillity and helping others. This was the objective of EU and it also succeeded in this. (ii) Challenge to US hegemony: US hegemony was established after the disintegration of Soviet Union, Organisations that can control US hegemony were required. EU was established and it was made strong so that they don’t have to bend in front of powers like America and China. The EU has emerged as an organisation that is economically, politically and militarily stable. (iii) Economic development: The EU is the world’s biggest economy with a GDP of more than US $12 trillion 2005, which is slightly larger than that of US. Its share of world trade is three times larger than that of the US. Its currency, Euro can pose a threat to the dominance of US dollar. Its economic power gives it an influence over America and China. (iv) Political and diplomatic powers: The EU also has strong political and diplomatic influence. This has enabled the EU to influence some US policies, such as the current US position on Iran’s nuclear programme. Its use of diplomacy, economic investments, and negotiations rather than coercion and military force has beeneffective as in the case of its dialogue with China on human rights and environmental degradation. (v) Military power: Militarily, the EU’s combined armed forces are the second largest in the world. Its total spending on defence is second after the US. Two EU member states, Britain and France have nuclear arsenals of approximately 550 nuclear warheads. It is also the world’s second most important source of space and communications technology.","if it would became the World’s largest economy by 2040, thus leaving US behind.

 EU with a GDP of over $ 12 trillion (2005) is the biggest economy in the world surpassing even that of US. Its currency Euro can pose a serious threat to the hegemony of US dollar. EU’s share of world trade is three times bigger than that of US. The economic power of EU gives it power to influence its neighbours as well as Asian and African countries. Its members Britain and France are permanent members of the UNSC. Several non-permanent members of UNSC are also from EU. This has enabled the EU to influence some US policies such as US position on Iran’s nuclear program. Militarily, the EU’s combined armed forces are the second largest in the world.

Name the pillars and objectives of the ASEAN Community. [NCERT] Ans. Countries of South-East Asia were under pressure of colonialism before the Second World War. The colonialism was of European countries like France, Britain and Holland. These countries, even after their independence had to suffer from miseries like poverty, illiteracy, scarcity of food, economic backwardness and formation of nation. They had to suffer from the hegemony of a single superpower after the end of Cold War. Bandung summit and NAM didn’t prove successful in promoting unity in Asia and third world countries. In this condition, five countries of South-East Asia namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand by signing the Bangkok Declaration in 1967, established Association for Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN took step forward to form ASEAN community based on the following three pillars in 2003: 1. ASEAN security community: ASEAN security community was based on the conviction that outstanding territorial disputes should not escalate into armed confrontation. By 2003, ASEAN has several agreements in place by which member state promised to uphold peace, neutrality, cooperation, noninterference, and respect for national differences and sovereign rights. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), established in 1994, is an organisation that carries out coordination of security and foreign policy. 2. ASEAN Economic Community: ASEAN still remains principally an economic association. While the ASEAN region as a whole is a much smaller economy compared to the US, the EU and Japan, its economy is growing much faster than all these. This accounts for the growth in its influence on both, in the region and beyond.

Second World War shattered many of the assumptions and structures on which the European states had based their relations. In 1945, the European states confronted the ruin of their economies and the destruction of the assumptions and structures on which Europe had been founded, European integration after 1945 was aided by the Cold War. America extended massive financial help for reviving Europe’s economy under the ‘Marshall Plan’. The US also created a new collective security structure under NATO. Under the Marshall Plan, the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) was established in 1948 to channel aid to the west European states. The Councilof Europe, established in 1949, was another step forward in political cooperation. The process of economic integration of Western European countries led to the formation of European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957. This process acquired a political dimension with the creation of the European Parliament. The collapse of the Soviet bloc put Europe on a fast track and resulted in the establishment of the ‘European Union’ in 1992. Q.2. How was ASEAN established? Ans. Before and during the Second World War, south eastern region of Asia suffered the economical and political consequences of repeated colonialisms, both European and Japanese. At the end of the war, it confronted problems of nation building, the ravages of poverty and economic backwardness and the pressure to align with great poweror another during the cold war. This was the receipt for conflict, which the countries of southeast Asia could ill afford. Efforts at Asian and Third World Unity, such as the Bandung conference and the Non-Aligned Movement were ineffective in establishing the conventions for informal cooperation and interaction. Hence, the Southeast Asian nations sought an alternative by establishing the Association for southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN was established in 1967 by five countries of this region – Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand – by signing the ‘Bangkok Declaration’. Q.3. Write any four features of ASEAN. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. (i) ASEAN countries adopted a form of interaction, that is informal, nonconfrontationist, and cooperative. This was known as ‘ASEAN way’. (ii) ASEAN is an economic organisation. ASEAN regions is a small economy as compared to that of Japan, the EU and the US. But its economy is growing faster and it is emerging than all these.

What is the objective of ASEAN? Ans. The objective of ASEAN is to accelerate economic growth and by means of economic growth, that social progress and cultural development could be achieved. Q.35. What is the objective of ASEAN Economic community? Ans. The objective of ASEAN Economic Community is to create a common market and production base within ASEAN states and to aid social and economic development in the region. Q.36. Why was ASEAN established? [CBSE Delhi 2016] Ans. ASEAN was established: • • •
 for reviving Europe’s economy under what was called the ‘Marshall Plan’ in 1948. Western countries were made clear that they would definitely have to face a huge destruction if they continue to fight amongst themselves. The incident of monopoly of a communist government in Czechoslovakia in February 1948 made this clear. The Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) was established in 1948 to channel aid to the West European states. ‘The Council of Europe’ established in 1949, was another step forward in political cooperation. The process of economic integration of European capitalist countries proceeded step by step leading to the formation of the European Economic Community in 1957. The Collapse of the Soviet bloc put Europe on a fast track and resulted inthe establishment of the European Union in 1992. The foundation was thus laid for a common foreign and security policy, cooperation on justice and home affairs and the creation of a single currency. It has its own flag, anthem, founding date, and currency. It also has some form of a common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations. Q.3. Name the pillars and objectives of the ASEAN Community. [NCERT] Ans. Countries of South-East Asia were under pressure of colonialism before the Second World War. The colonialism was of European countries like France, Britain and Holland. These countries, even after their independence had to suffer from miseries like poverty, illiteracy, scarcity of food, economic backwardness and formation of nation. They had to suffer from the hegemony of a single superpower after the end of Cold War. Bandung summit and NAM didn’t prove successful in promoting unity in Asia and third world countries. In this condition, five countries of South-East Asia namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand by signing the Bangkok Declaration in 1967, established Association for Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN took step forward to form ASEAN community based on the following three pillars in 2003: 1. ASEAN security community: ASEAN security community was based on the conviction that outstanding territorial disputes should not escalate into armed confrontation. By 2003, ASEAN has several agreements in place by which member state promised to uphold peace, neutrality, cooperation, noninterference, and respect for national differences and sovereign rights. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), established in 1994, is an organisation that carries out coordination of security and foreign policy. 2. ASEAN Economic Community: ASEAN still remains principally an economic association. While the ASEAN region as a whole is a much smaller economy compared to the US, the EU and Japan, its economy is growing much faster than all these. This accounts for the growth in its influence on both, in the region and beyond. The objectives of the ASEAN Economic Community are to create a common market and production base with ASEAN states and to aid social and
 economic development in the region. ASEAN has focussed on creating a Free Trade Area (FTA) for investment, labour and services. 3. Regional and Cultural Community: ASEAN is rapidly growing into a very important regional organisation. Its vision 2020 has defined as outward looking role for ASEAN in an international community. This builds on the existing ASEAN policy to encourage negotiation over conflicts in the region. Thus, ASEAN has mediated the end of the Cambodian conflict and East Timor crises. Q.4. Explain any four core objectives of ASEAN. [CBSE (AI) 2013] Ans. Core objectives of ASEAN are as follows: 1. To promote regional peace and stability by following the principles mentioned in announcement letter of UN. To unite South-East Asian member countries to promote mutual peace, tranquility to establish coordination and to maintain an environment of self-confidence and self-safety. 2. To promote economic developments, to gain economic development, social reform and cultural development mutually. 3. To increase mutual trust, to build a strong exchange ideology and try to resolve each other’s problems. 4. To be concerned about the people of south East Asia and bring about reforms for their improved standard of living. To organise summits that resolve political, social, economical and cultural issues and shikhan conference. 5. To respect nation’s unity to keep ASEAN intact and capable. 6. To be the bases of collective market and production for ASEAN countries. Q.5. Analyse any three factors responsible for the European Union to be a highly influential regional organization.

All the countries including US have now started to maintain a sound relationship, bypassing old issues. Q.15. What makes the European Union a highly influential regional organization? [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. EU has considerable political, military and diplomatic influence: i. ii. iii. iv. v.
 vi.
 EU with a GDP of over $ 12 trillion (2005) is the biggest economy in the world surpassing even that of US. Its currency Euro can pose a serious threat to the hegemony of US dollar. EU’s share of world trade is three times bigger than that of US. The economic power of EU gives it power to influence its neighbours as well as Asian and African countries. Its members Britain and France are permanent members of the UNSC. Several non-permanent members of UNSC are also from EU. This has enabled the EU to influence some US policies such as US position on Iran’s nuclear program. Militarily, the EU’s combined armed forces are the second largest in the world. Its total spending on defense is second after the US.
 Q.1. What makes the European Union a highly influential regional organisation? [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. Following are the factors that make the European union a highly influential regional organisation: (i) Establishment of peace and tranquility: It became clear that war can never prove to be a step in the direction of country’s development. Prosperity and peace can be established by maintaining tranquillity and helping others. This was the objective of EU and it also succeeded in this. (ii) Challenge to US hegemony: US hegemony was established after the disintegration of Soviet Union, Organisations that can control US hegemony were required. EU was established and it was made strong so that they don’t have to bend in front of powers like America and China. The EU has emerged as an organisation that is economically, politically and militarily stable. (iii) Economic development: The EU is the world’s biggest economy with a GDP of more than US $12 trillion 2005, which is slightly larger than that of US. Its share of world trade is three times larger than that of the US. Its currency, Euro can pose a threat to the dominance of US dollar. Its economic power gives it an influence over America and China. (iv) Political and diplomatic powers: The EU also has strong political and diplomatic influence. This has enabled the EU to influence some US policies, such as the current US position on Iran’s nuclear programme. Its use of diplomacy, economic investments, and negotiations rather than coercion and military force has beeneffective as in the case of its dialogue with China on human rights and environmental degradation. (v) Military power: Militarily, the EU’s combined armed forces are the second largest in the world. Its total spending on defence is second after the US. Two EU member states, Britain and France have nuclear arsenals of approximately 550 nuclear warheads. It is also the world’s second most important source of space and communications technology. Q.2. How did European countries fire their problems after the Second World War? Discuss the steps taken which led to the establishment of the European Union. Ans. European leaders were worried as they were unable to decide whether to restart old confrontations or to bring out positive reforms to improve international relationship. The second world war had shattered many of the assumptions and structures on which the European states had based their relations. America extended massive financial help

Substantiate your answer with a suitable example. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Or Explain ‘Common but different responsibilities’. How and where has this been pressurised? [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. On the issue of ‘Environmental Protection’, the developing countries agree that ecological degradation is a product of industrial development undertaken by advanced countries. Thus responsibilities of its compensation should be a priority. This argument
 Q.1. What has been reported in the ‘Human Development Report’ of the United Nations? Ans. According to the Human Development Report 2006 of the United Nations Development Programme, 1.2 billion people in developing countries have no access to clean and safe water and 2.6 billion have no access to sanitation, resulting in the death of more than three million children every year. Q.2. What is the importance of Natural forests? Ans. Importance of Natural Forests are as follows: 1. Helps to stabilise the climate 2. Mediates water supplies 3. Harbour a majority of the planet’s biodiversity on land 4. Land is saved from getting converted into barren. Q.3. How does issues of environmental degradation became a part of world politics? [CBSE Delhi 2008] Ans. Issues of environmental degradation became a part of world politics because environment was getting affected due to the economic development. An effective and concerned initiative was to be taken in order to curb the negative effect on environment. Q.4. How do developing countries argue on environmental degradation? Ans. Developing countries argue that most of the contributions in harming our environment is of developed countries. So, the developed countries should take most of the responsibilities in saving environment. Developing countries are reluctant in having mutual consent of responsibilities with developed countries. Q.5. Among which countries were violent struggles seen on water issues? Ans. There was a struggle between Israel, Syria and Jordan in 1950s and 1960s over attempts by each side to divert water from the Jordan and Yarmulke Rivers, and more recent threats between Turkey, Syria, and Iraq over the construction of dam on the Euphrates River. Q.6. Why should ‘environmental degradation issues’ be seen as a part of contemporary world politics?
 Ans. At present, most of the steps to check environmental degradation are such that no single government can address them fully. Therefore, they have to become part of world politics. They fall within the scope of contemporary world politics. Q.7. Write a short note on Movements against Mega-dams. Ans. In every country where a mega dam is being built, one is likely to find an environmental movement opposing it. Increasingly, anti-dam movements are pro-river movements for more sustainable and equitable managements of river systems and valleys. The early 1980s saw the anti-dam movement launched in the North, namely the campaign tosave the Franklin River and its surrounding forests in Australia. This was a wilderness and forest campaign as well as anti dam campaign. At present, there has been a surge in mega-dam building in the south, from Turkey to Thailand to South Africa, from Indonesia to China. India has had some of the leading anti-dam, pro river movements. Narmada Bachao Andolan, Tehri-dam-movement are good example of it. Main features of such Andolan is the shared idea of non-violence. Q.8. Suggest any two steps to be taken by the government to check pollution and save environment. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. Steps taken by the government to check pollution and save environment are: (i) More plantation. (ii) Auto fuel policy. (iii) To frame policies to reduce pollution created by industries. (iv) Use of renewable energy. (v) Ban on polluting vehicles. Q.9. Who are Indigenous peoples? Ans. The UN defines indigenous population as comprising the descendants of peoples who inhabited the present territory of a country at the time when persons of different culture or ethnic origin arrived there from other parts of the world and overpowered them. Indigenous people today live more in conformity with their particular social, economic, and cultural customs and traditions than the institutions of the country of which they now form a part. Q.10. What is Kyoto Protocol? Ans. The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement setting targets for industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Certain gases like Carbon dioxide, Methane, Hydro-Fluoro carbons etc. are considered partly responsible for global warming the rise in global temperature which may have disastrous consequences forlife on Earth. The protocol was agreed to in 1997 in Kyoto in Japan. India signed Kyoto

Q.3. Explain indigenous people and their rights with respect to India. Ans. The indigenous people bring the issues of environment, resources and politics together. The UN defines indigenous populations as comprising the descendants of peoples who inhabited the present territory of a state at the time when persons of a different culture or ethnic origin arrived there from other parts of the world and overpowered them. Indigenous people today live more in conformity with their particular social, economic, and cultural customs and traditions than the institutions of the country of which they now form a part. In the context of the world politics, the common interest of approximately 30 crore indigenous people spread throughout the world including India, like other social movements, indigenous people speak of their struggles, their agenda and their rights. The indigenous voices in the world politics call for the admission of indigenous people to the world community as equals, indigenous people occupy areas in Central and South America, Africa, India and Southeast Asia. In India, the description ‘Indigenous People’ is usually applied to the scheduled tribes, who constitute nearly 8 per cent of the population of the country. With the exception of small communities of hunters and gatherers, most indigenous population in India depend for their subsistence primarily on the cultivation of land. For Centuries, if notmillennia, they had free access to as much land as they could cultivate. It was only after the establishment of the British colonial rule that areas, which had previously been inhabited by the Scheduled Tribe Communities were subjected to outside forces. Although they enjoy a constitutional protection in political representation, they havenot got much of the benefits of development in the country. In fact, they have paid a huge cost for development since they are the single largest group among the people displaced by various development projects since independence.Issues related to the rights of the indigenous communities have been neglected in domestic and international politics for very long. During the 1970s, growing indigenous leaders from around the world aroused the world a sense of common concern and shared experience. The World Council of Indigenous peoples was formed in 1975. The council became subsequently the first of 11 indigenous NGOs to receive consultative status in the UN.

 Q.4. Describe any three steps taken by the Indian Government to check the environmental degradation. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Steps taken by the Indian government to check the Environmental Degradation: (i) National Auto-fuel policy: Indian National Auto Fuel Policy mandates cleaner fuels for vehicles. (ii) Energy Conservation Act: The Energy Conservation Act passed in 2001, outlines initiatives to improve energy efficiency. The Electricity Act of 2003 encourages the use of renewable energy. (iii) National Mission on Biodiesel: The Indian Government is also keen to launch a National Mission on Biodiesel, using about 11 million hectares of land to produce Biodiesel, and India has one of the largest renewable energy programmes in the world. Q.5. Write a note on Sacred Groves in India. Ans. Protecting nature for religious reasons is an ancient practice in many traditional societies, Sacred groves means parcels of uncut forest vegetation, Sacred groves in India are in the name of certain deities or natural ancestral spirits. As a model of community-based resource management, groves have lately gained an attention in conservation towards this. The sacred groves can be seen as a system that informally forces traditional communities to harvest natural resources in an ecologically sustained fashion. Some researches believe that sacred groves hold the potential for preserving not only the biodiversity and ecological functions, but also cultural diversity. Sacred groves represent a rich set of forest preservation practices and they share characteristics with common property resource systems. Their size ranges from clumps of a few trees to several hundred acres. Traditionally, sacred groves have been valued for their embodied spiritual and cultural attribute. Hindus commonly worshiped natural objects, including trees and groves. Many temples have originated from sacred groves.Deep religious admiration and veneration for nature, rather than resource scarcity, seems to be the basis for the long-standing commitment to preserving these forests. In recent years, however, expansion and human settlement have slowly encroached on sacred forests. In many places, the institutional identity of these traditional forests is fading with the advent of new national forest policies. A real problem in managing sacred groves arises when legal ownership and operational control are held by different entities. The two entities mean the states and the community, vary in their policy norms and underlyingmotives for using the sacred groves. Q.6. ‘There is a difference in the approach towards environment between the countries of the North and the South.’ Explain the statement with reference to the Earth Summit (1992) and the Kyoto Protocol (1997)?
 [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. The Global south believes that global north is responsible for much of the environmental degradation as most of the developments and industrialisation have taken place in the north only. Their contention is that they are still on the path of development and, therefore, should not be subjected to the same restrictions. Countries of the north havea larger responsibility of ecological conservation. This principle was accepted at the Rio Summit 1992 and is popularly called ‘common but differentiated responsibility’. The Kyoto Protocol, which is based on the principles of UNFCCC 1992, also sets targets for industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Q.7. What is resource geopolitics? Explain with an example. Ans. Resource geopolitics is all about who get what, when, where and how one gets the resources? Resources have provided some of the key means and motives of global European power expansion. They have also been the focus of inter-state rivalry. Western geopolitical thinking about resources has been dominated by the relationship of trade, was and power at the core of which were overseas resources and maritime navigation. Since sea power itself is rested on access to timber, naval timber supply became a key priority for major European powers from the 17th century onwards. The critical importance of ensuring uninterrupted supply of strategic resources, in particular oil, was well established during both the First World War and the Second World War. Throughout the cold war, the industrialised countries of the north adopted a number of methods to ensure a steady flow of resources. These included the deployment of military forces near exploitation sites and along sea-lanes of communication, the stockpiling of strategic resources, efforts to prop up friendly governments in producing countries, as well as support to multinational companies and favourable international agreements. Traditional western strategic thinking remained concerned with access to supplies, which might be threatened by the Soviet Union. A particular concern was western control of oil in the gulf and strategic minerals in Southern and Central Africa. After the end of the cold war and the fragmentation of the Soviet Union, the security of supply continues to worry government and business decision with regard to several minerals, in particular, radioactive materials. However, oil continues to be the most important resource in the global strategy. The global economy relied on oil for much of the 20th century as a portable and imperative fuel. The immense wealth associated with oil generates political struggles to control it, and the history of petroleum is also the history of war and struggle. Now here is this more obviously the case than in West Asia and Central Asia. West Asia, specifically the Gulf region, accounts for about 30 per cent of global oil production. But it has about 64 per cent of the planet’s known resources and it therefore the only region able to satisfy any substantial rise in oil demand. Saudi Arabia has a quarter of the world’s total reserves and it is single largest producer. Iraq’s known resources are second only to Saudi Arabia’s. And since substantial portions of Iraqi territory are yet to be fully explored, there is a fair chance that actual reserve might be far larger. The United States, Europe, Japan and increasingly India and China, which

Q.3. Explain indigenous people and their rights with respect to India. Ans. The indigenous people bring the issues of environment, resources and politics together. The UN defines indigenous populations as comprising the descendants of peoples who inhabited the present territory of a state at the time when persons of a different culture or ethnic origin arrived there from other parts of the world and overpowered them. Indigenous people today live more in conformity with their particular social, economic, and cultural customs and traditions than the institutions of the country of which they now form a part. In the context of the world politics, the common interest of approximately 30 crore indigenous people spread throughout the world including India, like other social movements, indigenous people speak of their struggles, their agenda and their rights. The indigenous voices in the world politics call for the admission of indigenous people to the world community as equals, indigenous people occupy areas in Central and South America, Africa, India and Southeast Asia. In India, the description ‘Indigenous People’ is usually applied to the scheduled tribes, who constitute nearly 8 per cent of the population of the country. With the exception of small communities of hunters and gatherers, most indigenous population in India depend for their subsistence primarily on the cultivation of land. For Centuries, if notmillennia, they had free access to as much land as they could cultivate. It was only after the establishment of the British colonial rule that areas, which had previously been inhabited by the Scheduled Tribe Communities were subjected to outside forces. Although they enjoy a constitutional protection in political representation, they havenot got much of the benefits of development in the country. In fact, they have paid a huge cost for development since they are the single largest group among the people displaced by various development projects since independence.Issues related to the rights of the indigenous communities have been neglected in domestic and international politics for very long. During the 1970s, growing indigenous leaders from around the world aroused the world a sense of common concern and shared experience. The World Council of Indigenous peoples was formed in 1975. The council became subsequently the first of 11 indigenous NGOs to receive consultative status in the UN.

‘There is a difference in the approach towards environment between the countries of the North and the South.’ Explain the statement with reference to the Earth Summit (1992) and the Kyoto Protocol (1997)?  ,"The Global south believes that global north is responsible for much of the environmental degradation as most of the developments and industrialisation have taken place in the north only. Their contention is that they are still on the path of development and, therefore, should not be subjected to the same restrictions. Countries of the north havea larger responsibility of ecological conservation. This principle was accepted at the Rio Summit 1992 and is popularly called ‘common but differentiated responsibility’. The Kyoto Protocol, which is based on the principles of UNFCCC 1992, also sets targets for industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions.","Q.1. Explain any three environmental concerns in global politics. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. Environmental concerns in global politics: (i) Cultivated area in world is limited and there is less scope to expand it. It is also a matter of concern that a substantial portion of existing agricultural land is losing fertility and are over-harvested. (ii) Issues related to access safe water and sanitation is very important. According to UNDP report, 1.2 billion people in developing countries have no access to safe water and 2.6 billion have no access to sanitation. (iii) For ecological balance, natural forests are important environmental concerns in global politics. Ecological degradation may affect climate change and it may affect biodiversity on land. (iv) A steady decline in the total amount of ozone in the earth’s stratosphere poses a real danger to ecosystems and human health. (v) The Coastal waters are becoming increasingly polluted largly due to landbased activities. It may cause deterioration in the quality of marine environment. Q.2. What is meant by ‘Common but differentiated responsibility’? How could we implement the idea? [NCERT] Or ‘States have Common but different responsibilities towards environment’. Substantiate your answer with a suitable example. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Or Explain ‘Common but different responsibilities’. How and where has this been pressurised? [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. On the issue of ‘Environmental Protection’, the developing countries agree that ecological degradation is a product of industrial development undertaken by advanced countries. Thus responsibilities of its compensation should be a priority. This argument
 was accepted in the Rio Declaration at the ‘Earth Summit’ in 1992 and is called the principle of ‘Common but differentiated responsibilities’. The relevant part of the Rio Declaration says that ‘States shall cooperate in the spirit of global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity of Earth’s ecosystem, in view of the different contributions of global environmental deterioration, states have common but differentiated responsibilities. The developedcountries acknowledge the responsibilities that they bear in the international pursuit of sustainable development in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technological and financial resources they command’. The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also provides that the parties should act to protect the climate system on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Q.3. Explain indigenous people and their rights with respect to India. Ans. The indigenous people bring the issues of environment, resources and politics together. The UN defines indigenous populations as comprising the descendants of peoples who inhabited the present territory of a state at the time when persons of a different culture or ethnic origin arrived there from other parts of the world and overpowered them. Indigenous people today live more in conformity with their particular social, economic, and cultural customs and traditions than the institutions of the country of which they now form a part. In the context of the world politics, the common interest of approximately 30 crore indigenous people spread throughout the world including India, like other social movements, indigenous people speak of their struggles, their agenda and their rights. The indigenous voices in the world politics call for the admission of indigenous people to the world community as equals, indigenous people occupy areas in Central and South America, Africa, India and Southeast Asia. In India, the description ‘Indigenous People’ is usually applied to the scheduled tribes, who constitute nearly 8 per cent of the population of the country. With the exception of small communities of hunters and gatherers, most indigenous population in India depend for their subsistence primarily on the cultivation of land.

The Kyoto Protocol, which is based on the principles of UNFCCC 1992, also sets targets for industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Q.7. What is resource geopolitics? Explain with an example. Ans. Resource geopolitics is all about who get what, when, where and how one gets the resources? Resources have provided some of the key means and motives of global European power expansion. They have also been the focus of inter-state rivalry. Western geopolitical thinking about resources has been dominated by the relationship of trade, was and power at the core of which were overseas resources and maritime navigation. Since sea power itself is rested on access to timber, naval timber supply became a key priority for major European powers from the 17th century onwards. The critical importance of ensuring uninterrupted supply of strategic resources, in particular oil, was well established during both the First World War and the Second World War. Throughout the cold war, the industrialised countries of the north adopted a number of methods to ensure a steady flow of resources. These included the deployment of military forces near exploitation sites and along sea-lanes of communication, the stockpiling of strategic resources, efforts to prop up friendly governments in producing countries, as well as support to multinational companies and favourable international agreements. Traditional western strategic thinking remained concerned with access to supplies, which might be threatened by the Soviet Union. A particular concern was western control of oil in the gulf and strategic minerals in Southern and Central Africa. After the end of the cold war and the fragmentation of the Soviet Union, the security of supply continues to worry government and business decision with regard to several minerals, in particular, radioactive materials. However, oil continues to be the most important resource in the global strategy. The global economy relied on oil for much of the 20th century as a portable and imperative fuel. The immense wealth associated with oil generates political struggles to control it, and the history of petroleum is also the history of war and struggle. Now here is this more obviously the case than in West Asia and Central Asia. West Asia, specifically the Gulf region, accounts for about 30 per cent of global oil production. But it has about 64 per cent of the planet’s known resources and it therefore the only region able to satisfy any substantial rise in oil demand. Saudi Arabia has a quarter of the world’s total reserves and it is single largest producer. Iraq’s known resources are second only to Saudi Arabia’s. And since substantial portions of Iraqi territory are yet to be fully explored, there is a fair chance that actual reserve might be far larger.

The United States, Europe, Japan and increasingly India and China, which
 consume this petroleum, are located at a considerable distance from the region. It is said that America always want to control the oil region of Iraq. Q.8. Define the ‘Indigenous People’ and highlight any two threats to their survival. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Or Who are indigenous people? Describe any four problems of the indigenous people. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Indigenous People The UN defined indigenous populations comprising of the descendants of people who inhabited the present territory of a country at the time when persons of a different culture or ethnic origin arrived there from other parts of the world and overcome them. Threats to their Survival (i) The indigenous people in the world demand to be treated as equal. They appeal to governments to come to terms with the continuing existence of indigenous nations as enduring communities with an identity of their own. (ii) The loss of land which also means the loss of an economic resource base is the most obvious threat to the survival of indigenous people. (iii) Although they enjoy a constitutional protection in political representation, they have not got much of the benefits of development in the country. They have paid a huge cost for development, since they are the single largest group among the people displaced by various developmental projects since independence.

A Coup took place in 1991, which was encouraged by Communist party hardliners. The people had tasted freedom by then and did not want the old-style rule of the communist party. All these factors forced Gorbachev to reform. Q.5. Describe the loopholes of Soviet System. [CBSE Delhi 2010] Ans. Soviet Union Emerged as a superpower after the Second World War. It developed in all areas but still it had the following loopholes which led to its destruction: 1. The economic, social and political life of Soviet citizens was fully under the control of state. Soviet system became very bureaucratic making life very difficult for its citizens. 2. Communist party of Soviet Union had a tight control over all institutions and was unaccountable to the people. The party bureaucrats gained more privilege than ordinary citizens, which increased in satisfaction among common citizens. 3. Lack of democracy and the absence of freedom of speech stifled people, who often expressed their dissent in jokes and cartoons. 4. The party refused to recognized the urge of people in the fifteen different republic that formed the Soviet union to manage their own affairs including their cultural affairs.

But in reality, Russia dominated everything and people from other regions felt neglected and often suppressed. 5. In the arms race, the Soviet Union managed to match the US from time to time, but at great cost. The Soviet Union lagged behind the west in technology, infrastructure (e.g., transport, power) and most importantly, in fulfilling the political or economic aspirations of citizens. 6. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 weakened the system even further. Though wages continued to grow, productivity and technology fell considerably behind that of the West. This led to the shortages in all consumer goods. Food imports increased every year. Q.6. Explain process of disintegration of Soviet Union during the period of Mikhail Gorbachev.
 Ans. Mikhail Gorbachev became president of Soviet Union in 1985. Reforms were necessary to keep the USSR abreast of the information and technological revolutions taking place in West. To resolve this situation, he introduced reform policies of ‘perestroika’ (restructuring) and ‘glasnost’ (openness); However Gorbachev’s decision to normaliserelations with the West and democratise and reforms the Soviet Union had some other effects that neither he nor anyone else intended or anticipated. The people in the East European countries, which were earlier the part of the Soviet bloc started to protest against their own governments and Soviet control. Unlike in the past, the Soviet Union, under Gorbachev, did not intervene when the disturbances occurred and the communist regimes collapsed one after another. These developments were accompanied by a rapidly escalating crisis within the USSR that hastened its disintegration. Gorbachev initiated the policies of economic and political reform and democratisation within the country. The reforms were opposed by leaders within the communist party. This increased the speed of disintegration of Soviet Union. The effect of ‘Glasnost’ (openness) policy first took place in Lithuania. Movement for the freedom from USSR began. Soon it spread to Estonia and Latvia. But Gorbachev took the favour of Glasnost instead resolving the matter. In October 1989, he declared that Warsaw pact members were free to decide their own future. In the next month, November 1989, citizens of Germany toppled the Berlin Wall. In February 1990, elections held at Soviet Parliament (Duma). Gorbachev stripped the Soviet Communist Party of its 72 years old monopoly owned power by calling on the Soviet Parliament (Duma) to permit multiparty politics. It had surprising consequences. The communist party which ruled for last 72 years lost the elections. Lithunia declared its independence in March 1990. Russian Parliament declared its independence from Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin played an important role in this process. This was the most deepest indication of disintegration of Soviet Union. The public revolt that occurred to remove of communist party in all the republics of Soviet Union after falling of Berlin Wall in 1989 was so powerful that it wasn’t possible to resolve it with the help of military force. In December 1991, under the leadership of Yeltsin, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, three major republics of the USSR, declared that the Soviet Union was disbanded. And in this way, Soviet Union was disintegrated. Q.7. Explain how did the Cuban Missile Crisis drive the world on the brink of a nuclear war? [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. (i) In April 1961, the USSR was worried that USA would attack Cuba and overthrow the government of Fidel Castro. Therefore, the leaders of Cuba decided to convert the country into a Russian base. (ii) Consequently, the USSR placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. This strategic move put the USA for the first time, under the fire from close range.

The communist party which ruled for last 72 years lost the elections. Lithunia declared its independence in March 1990. Russian Parliament declared its independence from Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin played an important role in this process. This was the most deepest indication of disintegration of Soviet Union. The public revolt that occurred to remove of communist party in all the republics of Soviet Union after falling of Berlin Wall in 1989 was so powerful that it wasn’t possible to resolve it with the help of military force. In December 1991, under the leadership of Yeltsin, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, three major republics of the USSR, declared that the Soviet Union was disbanded.

(i) In April 1961, the USSR was worried that USA would attack Cuba and overthrow the government of Fidel Castro. Therefore, the leaders of Cuba decided to convert the country into a Russian base. (ii) Consequently, the USSR placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. This strategic move put the USA for the first time, under the fire from close range.
 Ans. Mikhail Gorbachev became president of Soviet Union in 1985. Reforms were necessary to keep the USSR abreast of the information and technological revolutions taking place in West. To resolve this situation, he introduced reform policies of ‘perestroika’ (restructuring) and ‘glasnost’ (openness); However Gorbachev’s decision to normaliserelations with the West and democratise and reforms the Soviet Union had some other effects that neither he nor anyone else intended or anticipated. The people in the East European countries, which were earlier the part of the Soviet bloc started to protest against their own governments and Soviet control. Unlike in the past, the Soviet Union, under Gorbachev, did not intervene when the disturbances occurred and the communist regimes collapsed one after another. These developments were accompanied by a rapidly escalating crisis within the USSR that hastened its disintegration. Gorbachev initiated the policies of economic and political reform and democratisation within the country. The reforms were opposed by leaders within the communist party. This increased the speed of disintegration of Soviet Union. The effect of ‘Glasnost’ (openness) policy first took place in Lithuania. Movement for the freedom from USSR began. Soon it spread to Estonia and Latvia. But Gorbachev took the favour of Glasnost instead resolving the matter. In October 1989, he declared that Warsaw pact members were free to decide their own future. In the next month, November 1989, citizens of Germany toppled the Berlin Wall.

Cuba was a small island nation off the coast of Soviet Union and was an ally of the Soviet Union. In 1962, Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The installation of these weapons put the US under fire. The US President J.F. Kennedy was reluctant to nuclear war but was determined to get Khrushchev to remove the missile and nuclear weapons from Cuba in order to save his nation. Kennedy ordered American warships to intercept any Soviet ship heading to Cuba as a way of warning to USSR of his seriousness. A clash seemed imminent in what came to be known as Cuban Missile Crises but both the sides decided to avoid war. Thus, the world was saved from Third World War.

How did the Soviet Union suddenly disintegrate? Explain any six reasons. [CBSE (AI) 2016] Or Describe any six factors responsible for the disintegration of USSR. ,"Political leaders and ideologists have different methology on the subject of reasons of disintegration of Soviet Union. Soviet Union was disintegrated due to the following reasons: 1. Leaders of Soviet Union guaranteed respected standard of living after Soviet revolution to common citizens, who were unable to manage square meals during bureaucratic and authoritarian system at the time of establishment of Soviet System. There was an improvement in the standard of living of Soviet citizens afterrevolution undoubtedly. But the reforms couldn’t bring out the improvements to an appropriate level, which raised dissatisfaction among citizens. 2. Communist party had a complete control over Soviet Union. Party failed to accomplish/fulfill the aspirations of public. Public of republics felt neglected and suppressed under the domination of Russia. 3. Soviet Union emerged as a superpower after the Second World War. Due to this, the other superpower, America had to compete. Arms race began after the formation of Soviet Union. It emerged as an atomic power in 1948-49. Ths US progressed continuously and consistently whereas Soviet Union’s resources were wasted in the competition. This affected the development and improvement of economic life of people. 4. Some people believed that Soviet Union had dominated Eastern Europe after the Second World War. Soviet Union had to opt a policy for the development of those countries by sparing a large part of its economic equipments in order to gain an effective control on them. 5. Communist party was the only party that ruled for 72 years after the revolution of 1917. Due to this, the party members became bureaucrats. They were not answerable to citizens. Furthermore, the standard of living of members and  6.  7.  8.  9.  authorities of communist community was not the same as ordinary people. The party bureaucrats gained more privileges than ordinary citizens which increased disatisfaction among common citizens. Gorbachev implemented policies of ‘Perestroika’ (restructuring) and ‘Glasnost’ (openness). Then the citizens of Soviet Union came to know that Soviet Union lagged behind the West in terms of economic and infrastructure. The citizens lost interest in communist system after becoming aware of this fact. Soviet Union created problems for itself by doing military interference in Afghanistan during the period of Brezhnev. It ruined the economy of Soviet Union and Gorbachev declared that Warsaw Pact members were free to decide their own future. There were serious reactions of citizens of Soviet Union over economic reforms and policies of openness. Their aspirations went so high that they demanded more rights and openness. On the Other hand, members of communist party criticised reforms done by Gorbachev by saying that he was moving too quickly. In this ‘tug of war’, Gorbachev lost support on all sides and divided public opinion. Cooperation within all the republics could not establish even after the rule of a monopolist party for 72 years in Soviet Union. The Russian republics like Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia and Baltic Republics (Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia) always felt that they are not able to develop in the manner in which they should due to MiddleAsian backward union states. A large proportion of their equipments used to spend on these backward republics. ","Q.1. Who was Mikhail Gorbachev? Was he responsible for the disintegration of the Soviet Union? Ans. Mikhail Gorbachev was the last President of Soviet Union. It is not appropriate to blame him for the disintegration of Soviet Union because his policies was the reason behind the disintegration of Soviet Union. He introduced economic and political reform policies of ‘perestroika’ (reconstructing) and ‘glasnost’ (openness) to remove the dissatisfaction of public. He signed various treaties to stop arms race with the US. He established peace by withdrawing Soviet troops from Afghanistan and Eastern Europe. He helped in unification of Germany and ended the Cold War. It was his political failure that inspite of his efforts, he couldn’t avoid disintegration of USSR and was blamed for that. Q.2. Mention any three features that distinguish the Soviet economy from that of a capitalist country like the US. [NCERT] Ans. (i) Soviet economy abolished the institution of private property and consciously designed a society based on the principles of equality. Land and productive assets were owned and controlled with Soviet States. (ii) On the contrary to capitalist economy, Soviet economy gave primacy to state and institution of the communist party. Russia dominated in every area. People from other regions felt neglected and suppressed. (iii) Unlike capitalist countries, economy of Soviet union was planned and controlled by the state. Private companies, private entrepreneurs, production and distribution were kept away whereas in capitalist country like USA, land and other productive assets, factories, mills, companies, etc. were owned by individuals or group of individuals, companies or capitalists or entrepreneurs. Soviet Union used much of its resources in maintaining a nuclear and military arsenal. Its arms race with the US deprived citizen of their economical and high living standards. Q.3. Write any two reasons responsible for disintegration of Soviet Union. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Or Clarify any three reasons responsible for the disintegration of Soviet Union. [CBSE Delhi 2014]
 Ans. Political leaders and ideologists have different methodology on the subject of reasons of disintegration of Soviet Union. Soviet Union was disintegrated due to the following reasons: 1. Leaders of Soviet Union guaranteed respected standard of living after Soviet revolution to common citizens, who were unable to manage the square meals during bureaucratic and authoritarian system at the time of establishment of Soviet System. There was an improvement in the standard of living of Soviet citizens after revolution undoubtedly. But the reforms couldn’t bring out the improvements to an appropriate level which gave rise to the dissatisfaction amongst citizens. 2. Communist party had an undocked control over Soviet Union. Party failed to accomplish/fulfil the aspirations of public. Public of republics felt neglected and suppressed under the domination of Russia. 3. Soviet Union emerged as a superpower after the Second World War. Due to this, the other superpower America had to compete. Arms race began after the formation of Soviet Union as atomic power in around 1948-49, where richer country like America took a front seat and resources of Soviet Union were wasted in this competition. This affected the way to improve economic life of the people. Q.4. Explain any four consequences of Shock Therapy. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Main consequences of shock therapy, adopted in 1990 were as follows: 1. Collapse of Industries: In Russia, the large state-controlled industrial complex almost collapsed, as about 90 per cent of its industries were put up for sale to private individuals and companies. Since the restructuring was carried out through market forces and not by the government – directed industrial policies, it led to the virtual disappearance of all the industries. This was called ‘the largest garage sale in history’ as valuable industries were undervalued and sold at throwaway prices. 2. Collapse of Food Security: The value of the ruble, the Russian currency, declined dramatically. The rate of inflation was so high that people lost all their savings. The collective farm system disintegrated leaving people without food security, and Russia started to import food. 3. Social Change: The old system of social welfare was systematically destroyed. The withdrawal of government subsidies pushed large sections of the people into poverty. The middle classes were pushed to the periphery of society, and the academic and intellectual man power disintegrated or migrated. A mafia emerged in most of these countries and started controlling many economic activities. Privatisation led to new disparities. Post-Soviet states, especially Russia, were

[CBSE Delhi 2012, 2013; (AI) 2014]","(i) End of the Cold War: Disintegration of Soviet Union led to end of the Cold War confrontations. The ideological dispute over, whether the socialist system would beat the capitalist system was not an issue anymore. (ii) End of Massive Arms Race: Cold War with Ideological dispute had engaged the military of two blocs, had triggered a massive arms race and accumulation of nuclear weapons, and had led to the existence of military blocs. The end of the confrontation brought a ray of hope to that there will be an end to this arms race and peace would be established. (iii) Unipolar System: The possibility of disintegration of Soviet Union was expressed as either unipolar international politics with the domination of remaining one superpower on the rapidly changing international stage or European Union, SAARC, ASEAN, etc., could become important players in the international system,thereby bringing in a multipolar system where no one power could dominate. As it turned out, the US became the sole superpower.  (iv) Emergence of New Countries: The end of the soviet bloc meant the emergence of many new countries. All these countries had their own independent aspirations and choices. Some of them, especially the Baltic and East European states wanted to join the European Union and became a part of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation (NATO). The Central Asian Countries wanted to take advantage of their geographical location and continue their close ties with Russia and also to establish ties with the West, the US, China and other. Thus, the international stage showed many new players emerge, each with its own identity, interest and economic and political difficulties.

How did India benefit from Russia’s friendship after the disintegration of Soviet Union? [CBSE Sample Paper] Ans. Benefit to India from Russia: 1. Russia supported India during the Kargil War. 2. Russia supplied raw material to India for the development of energy sector. Q.14. Analyse Soviet Union’s situation after the Second World War. Ans. After the Second World War, Soviet Union became a great power. Soviet Union progressed in every field. The Soviet economy was then more developed than the rest of the world. Vast mineral and energy resources helped it in its economical development and progress. There was an improvement in the efficiency of transport sector. Eventhe remote areas of USSR were connected with the capital Moscow. It also improved much in scientific sector. It was successful in sending first space traveller to Moon. It was a leading country in terms of production of nuclear weapons. Everyone in Soviet Union had consumer goods, though their quality did not match that of the Western Capitalist countries. Yet basic necessities including health, education, childcare were available to all. There was no unemployment. All citizens were ensured of minimum living standards. Q.15. Why were people dissatisfied with Soviet System? Ans. Soviet system was based on the ideology but after the Second World War, there was an internal dissatisfaction which erupted like fire. The economic, social and political lives of Soviet citizens were under the state control, due to which bureaucracy increased, making life very difficult for its citizens. The Soviet political system centered around communist party. Thus, no proper system of democracy and freedom of speech was there. The party bureaucrats gained more privileges than ordinary citizens, which increased dissatisfaction among the people. The bureaucrats and authoritarians were not answerable to common people. There was a discrimination among the citizens of Russian republics and citizens of other republics due to which the citizens of other republics felt neglected and often suppressed. Q.16. Which step of Soviet Union in the period of Brezhnev led to its disintegration? Ans. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 weakened the system. Its economy ruined due to this step. Even after hard practice of ten years (1979-89), it couldn’t gain full control over Afghanistan and finally, it had to call back its armies. Invading Soviet Union in Afghanistan resulted in continuous shortage of consumer good and food products. The conditions were so miserable that food imports increased every year and
 it led to the increase in the dissatisfaction and anger amongst people. The Soviet economy was faltering in the late 1970s, became stagnant and finally Soviet Union disintegrated. Q.17. How did Soviet disintegration affect International economy? Ans. After the disintegration of Soviet Union, capitalist system gained more popularity than communist system. America gained benefit from this as it didn’t have to face any kind of problem in the expansion of its capitalist system. America evolved as the only superpower. The people of its opposite alliance were attracted towards its system. Now on the basis of America’s power and reputation, capitalist economy is the dominant economy at international level. Institutions like World Bank and IMF became advisories of different countries as these institutions provided loan to those countries to encourage them to move towards capitalist economy. In this manner, disintegration of Soviet Union had completely changed the International economical system.

Describe the process of evolution of the UN. Or Describe the UN.,"The First World War encouraged the world to invest in an international organisation to deal with conflict. Many believed that such an organisation would help the world to avoid war. As a result, ‘League of Nations’ was established in 1920. But it could not succeed in its objectives. Second World war began on 1st September 1939. Many more people died and were wounded in this war than ever before. The UN was founded as a successor to the ‘League of Nations’. It was established in 1945, immediately after the second world war. The UN’s objective is to prevent international conflict and to facilitate cooperation among states. It was founded with the hope that it would act to stop the conflicts between states escalating into war and if war broke out, to limit the extent of hostilities. Furthermore, since conflicts often arose from lack of social and economic development, the UN was intended to bring countries together to improve the prospects of social and economic development all over the world. The organisation was set up with 51 founder members and by 2017, the UN had 193 members. These included almost all independent states. In the UN General Assembly, all members have one vote each. In the UN security council, there are five permanent members. These are: the United Sates, Russia, the United Kingdom, France and China. These states were selected as permanent members as they were the mostpowerful immediately after the second world war and because they constituted the victors in the wars.The UN’s representative head is the Secretary General. The present Secretary General is Antonio Guterres from Portugal. He is the ninth secretary General of the UN. The main organs of UN are as follows: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.  General Assembly, Security Council, Economic and Social Council, Trusteeship Council, International Court of Justice, Secretariat.  The UN consists of many different structures and agencies which are as follows: 1. 2. 3. 4.

UN provides medical aid in emergency and loan from World Bank and IMF to backward countries. 5. Works on certain areas like – education, epidemic, health and terrorism which cannot be done without international cooperation. 6. Unipolar system is there in the world and US hegemony is seen in the world. UN can control US. It can hold a discussion between US and other countries on certain issues. UN, alongwith its member nations can react to US hegemony and actions. Q.16. ‘Reforming the UN means restructuring of the security council.’ Do you agree with this statement? Give arguments for or against this position. [NCERT] Ans. Security Council is an integral part of the United Nations. It acts as UN’s executive head. There are five permanent members and ten non-permanent members. America, Britain, China, France and Russia are its permanent members. The non-permanent members serve for only two years at a time. There are two ways to vote to take decision in Security council. In Procedural means, vote of atleast 9 members out of 15 members should be in favour of the proposal. While taking decisions related to military, finance or other important issues, all five permanent nations should agree in addition to the votes in favour of the proposal. In other words, the proposal does not pass if any one of the permanent member is not in its favour, irrespective of the number of votes came in its favour. This process of election in the security council is known as ‘veto’ power of the permanent-members of the UN. The Security Council is a powerful organistion of the UN. It can give directions to other countries to resolve conflicts between nations or can solve them by intervention, maintaining peace, law, order and security by resolving conflicts as it is the responsibility of the Security Council. If these peaceful ways do not work, then the Security Council adopts coercive method before war. It can even order the country found guilty to break trade-commerce-financial and diplomatic relations. If coercive method does not work, then military actions against the country found guilty, can also be taken. Reforms in structure of the Security Council can pave way for the UN’s improvement as the Security Council is the backbone of the UN. The structure of the Security Council is such that it plays role of a judge in all matters, so UN cannot be improved without structural reforms in the Security Council. Q.17. Although UN has failed to act as effective checks on the hegemony of US, nations prefer its continuation. Suggest any three suitable arguments to justify the relevance of UN in the post-cold war era. [CBSE Sample Paper 2016] Ans. Relevance of UN in the post-cold war period: (i) In the unipolar world, the UN can and has served to bring US and rest of the world into discussion on various issues.
 (ii) US leaders, in spite of their frequent criticisms of the UN, do see the organisation as serving a purpose in bringing together over 190 nations in dealing with conflict and socio-economic development. The UN does provide a space with in which arguments against specific US attitudes and policies are heard and compromises and concession can be shaped. (iii) Given the growing connections and links between societies and various issues of Interdependence, the importance and role of UN is likely to increase in future. Q.18. Give any three suitable arguments to support India’s candidature for the permanent membership of the UN Security Council. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. (i) India is second most populous country in the World comprising almost one-fifth of the World’s Population. (ii) India is also the world’s largest democracy and has virtually participated in all of the initiatives of the UN. (iii) Its role in the UN’s peace keeping efforts is a long and substantial one. (iv) India’s economic emergence on the world stage, due to its policies of liberalisation and globalisation, has enhanced its stake for its membership. (v) India has also made regular financial contribution to the UN and never faltered on its payments. (vi) India realises that the permanent seat is of quite symbolic importance. It shows a country’s growing significance in world affairs. This greater status makes the country’s representation more powerful and its foreign policy more influential. (Any three) Q.19. State any six post-Cold War changes that have necessitated reforms to make the UN work better. [CBSE (AI) 2016] Ans. The changes that occurred in the post-Cold War: (i) The disintegration of the Soviet Union caused its seat in UNSC to be taken by Russia. (ii) The emergence of USA as the sole superpower and its hegemony in the UN. (iii) USA and Russia began to cooperate on multiple world issues. (iv) The rise of China, India, Brazil and of African nations required them to be adequately represented in UN.

 (iii) The UN consists of many structures and agencies (iv) War, peace, and difference between the member states are discussed in the General Assembly. (v) Social and Economic issues are dealt with by many agencies including WTO, UNDP, UNHRC, UNICEF and UNESCO. (Any four points or any other relevant points) Q.6. Write the importance of the UN in unipolar world. Ans. With the disappearance of the Soviet Union, the US stands as the only superpower. Its military and economic power allow it to ignore the UN or any other international organisation. Secondly, within the UN, the influence of the US is considerable. As the single largest contributor to the UN, the US has unmatched Financial power. The fact that the UN is physically located within the US territory gives it additional influence. The power of the US and its veto power the US can stop any moves that it finds annoying or damaging toits interests or the interest of its friends and allies. The UN is not therefore a great balance to the US, Nevertheless, in a unipolar world in which the US is dominant, only the UN can initiate the talks between the US and various countries on different issues. UN provides an arena in which it is possible to modify US attitudes and policies. UN does provide a space within which argument and policies are heard and compromises and concessions can be shaped. The UN is an imperfect body, but without it the world would be worse off. Given the growing connections and independence, it is hard to imagine how more than seven billion people would live together without an organisation such as the UN. Q.7. List any four steps proposed by the member countries of UN in 2005 to make it more contemporary in the world. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Or Keeping in view the changed scenario, highlight any four steps taken by the member countries in 2005 to make the UN more contemporary. [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. The Question of UN membership is a serious one. As the UN completed 60 years of its existence, the heads of all the member-states met in September 2005 to celebrate the anniversary and review the situation. The leaders in this meeting decided that the following steps should be taken to make the UN more relevant in the changing context. 1. Creation of a peace building commission. 2.

(vi) A country that would make the council more representative of the world’s diversity in terms of geography, economic systems and culture. Q.4. Highlight the role played by India in the UN. [CBSE Sample Paper] Ans. India has been a member of the UN from its day of foundation, 24th October, 1945. It has shown deep respect towards the principles mentioned in the UN charter and considers the UN an integral organisation for world peace. Following are the roles played by India in the UN: 1. Considering the UN universal: India wants that all countries of the world become a part of the UN. India played a major role in making Bangladesh, Ireland, Hungary and Sri Lanka, a member of the UN. China and Pakistan always opposed India but India still favoured them. 2. Disarmament: All the countries have been demanding for disarmament after the second world war. India is one of them. India has been constantly supporting eliminating the use of nuclear weapons. The Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT) signed by the US, UK and USSR was welcomed by India. Foreign Minister of India was chosen as a representative in the UN’s disarmament summit. 3. Supporting the revolt against colonialism and apartheid: India has always revolted against colonialism, apartheid and racism. It is due to this reason that in 1961,

 "
Describe any three new sources of threat to security giving examples for each. [CBSE (AI) 2016],"The new sources of threat are: (i) Terrorism is a new source of threat. It can be of internal or external nature. It intends to bring fear and disruption within the minds of the nation rather than invade a nation. It relies on conflicts with innocent individuals rather than military personnel. Hijacking, suicide bombings, etc. are forms of terrorism. (ii) Environmental threats in the form of increased droughts, floods, change in weather, etc. have caused mass migrations, displacement, outflow of refugees and internal conflicts. This has given rise to the broader threat towards human security. (iii) The rise in endemic diseases such as SARS, Zika virus, etc. has spread with greater access due to globalization and increased movements of people and goods.","[CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. Following are the reasons behind increasing terrorism on international level: 1. Information and Technology have paved way for terrorism in its way of execution. That is why, terrorism is a global problem all over the world. 2. Globalisation of economy is responsible behind the situations like theft, hijacking plains or planting of bombs, etc. The exchange of currency of any country has become easier for terrorists. 3. There is a competition of selling modernised weapons. The mastermind, government and traders are equally responsible behind spreading terror at individual level. 4. Advanced transport systems and mediums have enhanced terrorism. Q.8. Identify and elaborate any four sources of security threats. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. Following are the new sources of security threats: 1. Terrorism: It refers to political violence that targets civilians deliberately and indiscriminately. International terrorism involves the citizens or territory of more than one country. Terrorist groups seek to change a political context or condition that they do not like by force or threat of force. Civilian targets are usually chosen to terrorise the public and to use the unhappiness of the public as a weapon against national governments or other parties in conflict. 2. Global Poverty: Global Poverty is another source of insecurity. World population now at 650 crore will reach 700 to 800 within 25 years and may eventually level out of 900 to 1000 crore. Currently, half the world’s population growth occurs in just six countries—India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Among the World’s poorest countries, population is expected to triple in the next 50 years, whereas many rich countries will see population’s shrinkage in that period. High growth rate, high per capita income, high Education level and low population growth will make rich states or rich social groups get richer where as low growth rate, low per capita income, low education level and huge population growth reinforce each other to make poor states and poor groups become poorer. 3. Migration: Poverty in the South has also led to large-scale migration to seek a better life, especially better economic opportunities in the North. This has created international political frictions. International law and norms make a distinction between migrants and refugees. States are generally supposed to accept refugees,but they do not have to accept migrants. While refugees leave their country of origin, people who have fled their homes but remain within national borders are called internally displaced people. 4. Health Epidemics: Health Epidemics such as HIV-AIDS, bird flu, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have rapidly spread across countries through migration,

What is meant by Security? Mention any four components of Indian security strategy. ,"Security means ‘freedom from threats’. Four different components of India’s strategy are: (i) The first component is strengthening its own military capabilities because India has been involved in conflict with its neighbours, i.e., Pakistan & China. (ii) The second component has been to strengthen international norms and international institutions to protect its security. (iii) The third component is towards meeting security challenges within the country such as Nagaland, Mizoram, Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir. (iv) The fourth component has been an attempt to develop its economy and to bring the citizens out of poverty and economic inequalities.","Ans. Human Security means the protection of the people more than the protection of states. The proponents of human security argue that the primary aim of the state is the protection of its individuals. According to them the concept of human security should include hunger, diseases and natural disasters as they kill even more people than war.Thus, human security should protect people from these threats as well as from violence and war. In its broadest formulation, the human security agenda also encompasses economic security and ‘threats to human dignity’. Q.12. Explain four components of India’s security strategy. [CBSE Delhi, (AI) 2014] Ans. India’s security strategy has four broad components, which have been used in a varying combinations from time to time. 1. Strengthening Military Capabilities: India has been involved in conflicts with its neighbour—Pakistan in 1947-48, 1965, 1971 and 1999; and China in 1962. Since it is surrounded by nuclear-armed countries in the South Asian Region, India’s decision to conduct nuclear test in 1998 was justified by the Indian government in terms of safeguarding national security. India first tested a nuclear device in 1974. 2. Strengthen International Norms: India’s security strategy has been to strengthen international norms and international institutions to protect its security interests. India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru supported the cause of Asian solidarity, decolonisation, disarmament and the UN as a forum in which international conflicts could be settled. Most importantly it used non-alignment to help carve out an area of peace outside the bloc politics of the two superpowers. India joined 160 countries that have signed and ratified the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which provides a road map for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases to check global warming. Indian troops have been sent abroad on UN peacekeeping missions in support of cooperative security initiatives. 3. Internal Security: The third component of Indian security strategy is geared towards meeting security challenges within the country. Several militant groups from areas such as Nagaland, Mizoram, Punjab and Kashmir among others have, from time to time sought to break away from India. India has tried to preserve national unity by adopting a democratic political system, which allows different communities and groups of people to freely articulate their grievances and share political power. 4. Economic Growth: There has been an attempt in India to develop its economy in a way that the vast mass of citizens are lifted out of poverty and misery and huge economic inequalities are not allowed to exist. The attempt has not quite succeeded; we are still a very poor and unequal country. Yet democratic politics allows spaces for articulating the voice of the poor and the deprived citizens. There is a pressure on the democratically elected governments to combine economic growth with human

What is meant by traditional notion of external security? Describe any two components of this type of security.  Or  Explain balance of power as a component of traditional security policy. How could a state achieve this balance? ,"Traditional notion of external security– The greatest danger to a country is from military threats. The source of such a security threat emerges from another country which, through its military action, threatens the core values of sovereignity, independence and territorial integrity. Military action even endangers the life of ordinary residents of a country. In a war, it is highly unlikely that only soldiers would die or be hurt. In all the likelihood, men and women, who are ordinary citizens and soft targets are made victims in a war, to break their support for the war. Components of external security: 1. Avoidance of War: Governments may even make the choice of surrender when actually in a war, but this may not be promoted as a country’s defence policy. Security policy, is hence, concerned with preventing war, which is known as deterrence, and with limiting or ending war, which is called defence. 2. Balance of Power: Every country looks around to see potential bigger or stronger countries which can pose as a threat in the future. For instance, a neighbouring country might not declare that it is preparing for an attack. But the very fact, that the neighbour is powerful, points to the fact that in future the neighbour can be aggressive. Over here we can cite the example of South Asia. Even though India has never declared that it would attack upon its neighbours– Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, etc., yet these countries are skeptical about India’s military designs because of its preparedness, size and potential. All governments, are therefore, quite sensitive to the ‘Balance of Power’ between their country and other states. They strive hard to maintain a favourable balance with the other states especially with those with whom they had differences or conflicts in the past. For maintaining balance of power, they build up military power along with economic and technological power as the latter two are the very basis of a country’s hand or military power.","Explain balance of power as a component of traditional security policy.

They strive hard to maintain a favourable balance with the other states especially with those with whom they had differences or conflicts in the past. For maintaining balance of power, they build up military power along with economic and technological power as the latter two are the very basis of a country’s hand or military power. Q.4.Write a note on ‘ways of traditional security policy’. Ans. The most important of these are disarmament arms control and confidence building: 1. Disarmament: It requires all states to give up certain kinds of weapons. For example, the 1972 Biological weapons convention (BWC) and the 1992 Chemical weapons convention (CWC) banned the production and possession of these weapons. More than 155 states acceded to the BWC and 181 states acceded to the CWC. Both conventions include all the great powers. But the superpowers — the US and Soviet Union did not want to give up the third type of weapons of mass destruction, namely, nuclear weapons, so they pursued arms control.
 2. Arms Control: Arms Control regulates the acquisition or development of weapons. The Anti-ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 1972 tried to stop the United States and Soviet Union from using ballistic missiles as a defensive shield to launch a nuclear attack. While it did allow both countries to deploy a very limited number of defensive systems, it stopped them from large-scale production of those systems. The US and Soviet Union signed a number of other arms control treaties including the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty II or SALT II and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). The Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 was an arms control treaty in the sense that it regulated the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Those countries that had tested and manufactured nuclear weapons before 1967were allowed to keep their weapons; and those that had done to were to give up the right to acquire them. 3. Confidence Building: Traditional security also accepts confidence building as a means of avoiding violence. Confidence building is a process in which countries share ideas and information with their rivals. They tell each other about their military intentions and, upto a point, their military plans. This is a way of show that they are not planning a surprise attack. They also update each other about the kind of forces they possess, and they may share information on where those forces are deployed. In short, confidence building is a process designed to ensure that countries do not go to war through misunderstanding or misperception. All in all, traditional conceptions of security are principally concerned with the use or threat of use of military force. In traditional security, force is both the principal threat to security and the principal means of achieving security. Q.5. Explain non-traditional conception of security. Ans. 1. Human security: Human security is all about the protection of people more than the protection of countries. Human security and state security should be same. But secure states do not automatically mean secure peoples. Protecting citizens from foreign attack may be a necessary condition for the security of individuals, but it is certainly not a sufficient one. Indeed, during the last 100 years, more people have been killed by their own governments than by foreign armies. All defenders of human security agree that its primary goal is the protection of individuals. However, there are differences about precisely what threats individuals should be protected from. Advocates of the ‘narrow’ concept of human security focus on violent threats to individuals or, as former UN secretary–General Kofi Annan puts it, “the protection of communities and individuals from internal violence.” Proponents of the ‘broad’ concept of human security argue that the threat agenda should include hunger, disease and natural disasters because these kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined. Human security policy, they argue, should protect people from these threats and violence too. In its broadest formulation, the human security agenda also envelops economic security and ‘threats’ to ‘human dignity’. Put differently, the expansive formulation stresses what has been called ‘freedom from wants’ and ‘freedom from fear’ respectively.
 2. Global Security: The idea of global security emerged in the 1990s in response to the global nature of threats such as global warming, international terrorism, and health epidemics like AIDS and bird flu and so on. No country can resolve these problems alone. And, in some situations, one country may have to disproportionately bear the brunt of a global problem such as environment degradation. For example, dueto global warming, a sea level rise of 1.5–2.0 metres would flood 20 percent of Bangladesh, inundate most of the Maldives, and threaten nearly half the population of Thailand. Since these problems are global in nature, international cooperation is important, even though it is difficult to achieve. Q.6. In spite of strongly propagating for nuclear disarmament since Independence, India herself became nuclear in 1998. Analyse the reasons behind this development and also highlight important features of India’s nuclear policy. [CBSE Sample Paper 2016] Ans. Reasons for becoming nuclear: India shares hostile relations with its two immediate neighbours – China and Pakistan. There was a direct threat to India’s national security as China was already a nuclear state and had a war with India in 1962. Both the countries do not share very cordial relations with each other. Pakistan was also preparing to become nuclear with the help of Chinese government. So in order to preserve its national security, it was equally important for India to become a nuclear state. Features of India’s nuclear policy: 1. India believes in both horizontal and vertical nuclear disarmament. It is ready to disarm its nuclear weapons if all other counties of the world possessing nuclear weapons also disarm their nuclear weapons. 2. India has committed that it will never initiate a nuclear war against any country and will use nuclear weapons only for defensive purpose. 3. It will try to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and would possess only minimum nuclear deterrence. 4. India strongly opposes NPT and CTBT treaties as they were seen unjust and discriminatory. 5. It reiterates India’s commitment to global, verifiable and non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament leading to a nuclear weapon free world. Q.7. What is meant by traditional notions of internal and external security? Explain. [CBSE Delhi 2016] Ans. Traditional notion of internal security: The traditional notion of internal security stems from the security of a country within its borders. The nations stem from security

Features of India’s nuclear policy: 1. India believes in both horizontal and vertical nuclear disarmament. It is ready to disarm its nuclear weapons if all other counties of the world possessing nuclear weapons also disarm their nuclear weapons. 2. India has committed that it will never initiate a nuclear war against any country and will use nuclear weapons only for defensive purpose. 3. It will try to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and would possess only minimum nuclear deterrence. 4. India strongly opposes NPT and CTBT treaties as they were seen unjust and discriminatory. 5. It reiterates India’s commitment to global, verifiable and non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament leading to a nuclear weapon free world. Q.7. What is meant by traditional notions of internal and external security? Explain. [CBSE Delhi 2016] Ans. Traditional notion of internal security: The traditional notion of internal security stems from the security of a country within its borders. The nations stem from security
 from internal rebellion, dissent and other forms of attacks. After 1945, USA, Soviet Union and Europe began to see security within their internal borders while newly independent countries such as from Asia and Africabegan to see civil wars, internal uprisings, etc. within their borders. Traditional notion of external security: The traditional notion of external security stems from protecting the territorial integrity of a nation from aggression and balance of power with other nations. This notion was seen dominant till the Second World War in North America and Europe but is still continuing in Asia and Africa.

Q.4.Write a note on ‘ways of traditional security policy’.,"The most important of these are disarmament arms control and confidence building: 1. Disarmament: It requires all states to give up certain kinds of weapons. For example, the 1972 Biological weapons convention (BWC) and the 1992 Chemical weapons convention (CWC) banned the production and possession of these weapons. More than 155 states acceded to the BWC and 181 states acceded to the CWC. Both conventions include all the great powers. But the superpowers — the US and Soviet Union did not want to give up the third type of weapons of mass destruction, namely, nuclear weapons, so they pursued arms control.  2. Arms Control: Arms Control regulates the acquisition or development of weapons. The Anti-ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 1972 tried to stop the United States and Soviet Union from using ballistic missiles as a defensive shield to launch a nuclear attack. While it did allow both countries to deploy a very limited number of defensive systems, it stopped them from large-scale production of those systems. The US and Soviet Union signed a number of other arms control treaties including the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty II or SALT II and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). The Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 was an arms control treaty in the sense that it regulated the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Those countries that had tested and manufactured nuclear weapons before 1967were allowed to keep their weapons; and those that had done to were to give up the right to acquire them. 3. Confidence Building: Traditional security also accepts confidence building as a means of avoiding violence. Confidence building is a process in which countries share ideas and information with their rivals. They tell each other about their military intentions and, upto a point, their military plans. This is a way of show that they are not planning a surprise attack. They also update each other about the kind of forces they possess, and they may share information on where those forces are deployed. In short, confidence building is a process designed to ensure that countries do not go to war through misunderstanding or misperception. All in all, traditional conceptions of security are principally concerned with the use or threat of use of military force. In traditional security, force is both the principal threat to security and the principal means of achieving security.","2.

All in all, traditional conceptions of security are principally concerned with the use or threat of use of military force. In traditional security, force is both the principal threat to security and the principal means of achieving security. Q.5. Explain non-traditional conception of security. Ans. 1. Human security: Human security is all about the protection of people more than the protection of countries. Human security and state security should be same. But secure states do not automatically mean secure peoples. Protecting citizens from foreign attack may be a necessary condition for the security of individuals, but it is certainly not a sufficient one. Indeed, during the last 100 years, more people have been killed by their own governments than by foreign armies. All defenders of human security agree that its primary goal is the protection of individuals. However, there are differences about precisely what threats individuals should be protected from. Advocates of the ‘narrow’ concept of human security focus on violent threats to individuals or, as former UN secretary–General Kofi Annan puts it, “the protection of communities and individuals from internal violence.” Proponents of the ‘broad’ concept of human security argue that the threat agenda should include hunger, disease and natural disasters because these kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined. Human security policy, they argue, should protect people from these threats and violence too. In its broadest formulation, the human security agenda also envelops economic security and ‘threats’ to ‘human dignity’. Put differently, the expansive formulation stresses what has been called ‘freedom from wants’ and ‘freedom from fear’ respectively.

Global Security: The idea of global security emerged in the 1990s in response to the global nature of threats such as global warming, international terrorism, and health epidemics like AIDS and bird flu and so on. No country can resolve these problems alone. And, in some situations, one country may have to disproportionately bear the brunt of a global problem such as environment degradation. For example, dueto global warming, a sea level rise of 1.5–2.0 metres would flood 20 percent of Bangladesh, inundate most of the Maldives, and threaten nearly half the population of Thailand. Since these problems are global in nature, international cooperation is important, even though it is difficult to achieve.","2. To prevent the other side from attacking by promising to raise the costs of war to an unacceptable level and 3. To defend itself when war actually breaks out so as to deny the attacking country its objectives or defeat the attacking forces altogether. Q.6. What do you mean by non-traditional notions of security? Ans. Non-traditional notions of security go beyond military threats to include a wide range of threats and dangers affecting the conditions of human existence. The entire human kind needs security, not just individuals or states according to the supporters of nontraditional notions of security. List of threatening humankind involves epidemic, famine and natural calamity. Q.7. Which treaties were signed by US and USSR for arm control? Ans. Following treaties were signed by US and USSR: 1. Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty 2. Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty 3. Strategic Arm Reduction Treaty 4. Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty Q.8. Elaborate any one point to deal with terrorism as a new source of security threat. [CBSE Delhi 2011] Ans. In order to deal with terrorism an established perspective of life should be developed as compared to castes, religion and nationality. Moral values should be taught to people. They should be inspired to adopt values such as friendship, kindness and cooperation. They should be prevented from the influence of destructive powers. Q.9. Who are involved in the oriented security cooperation at international level? Ans. Different countries and organisations at national and international levels such as UNO, WHO, World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and social organisations such as Red Cross, etc. can be included in the oriented security cooperation at international level. Q.10. How are human rights divided into three types? Ans. Human rights have come to be classified into three types:
 business, tourism and military operations. One country’s success or failure in limiting the spread of these diseases affects infections in other countries. By 2003, an estimated 4 crore people were infected with HIV-AIDS worldwide, twothirds of them in Africa and half of the rest in South Asia. Q.9. How many types of human rights are there? Ans. Human rights is an issue of human security. Human rights have come to be classified into three types: 1. Political Right seen as voting right, right to contest election and freedom of speech and assembly. 2. Economic and social rights such as right to earn, right to work, right of social security, etc. 3. Right to colonised people or ethnic and indigenous minorities. More emphasis have been given to these rights but there is no agreement on which set of rights should be considered as universal human rights, nor what the international community should do when rights are being violated. Since the 1990s, developments such as Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, the genocide in Rwanda, and the Indonesian military’s killing of people in East Timor have led to a debate on whether or not the UN should intervene to stop human rights abuses. There are those who argue that the UN charter empowers the international community totake up arms in defence of human rights. Others argue that the national interests of the powerful states will determine which instance of human right violations the UN should act upon. Q.10. List any four policy directive principles of state mentioned in Indian constitution to promote and international peace and security. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Measures of environmental protection, security to wild animals and increase in international peace and security have been mentioned in Article 51 of Indian constitution. On the basis of which India would regulate its foreign policy. Following are the principles: 1. To increase international peace and security. 2. To maintain justified and respectful relations between nations. 3. Foster respect for international law and treaty obligations in the dealings of organised peoples with one another. 4. To make efforts to mediate international controversies and promote settlement of international disputes by arbitration. Q.11. Explain the concept of ‘Human Security.’ [CBSE (AI) 2015]
 Ans. Human Security means the protection of the people more than the protection of states. The proponents of human security argue that the primary aim of the state is the protection of its individuals. According to them the concept of human security should include hunger, diseases and natural disasters as they kill even more people than war.Thus, human security should protect people from these threats as well as from violence and war. In its broadest formulation, the human security agenda also encompasses economic security and ‘threats to human dignity’. Q.12. Explain four components of India’s security strategy. [CBSE Delhi, (AI) 2014] Ans. India’s security strategy has four broad components, which have been used in a varying combinations from time to time. 1. Strengthening Military Capabilities: India has been involved in conflicts with its neighbour—Pakistan in 1947-48, 1965, 1971 and 1999; and China in 1962. Since it is surrounded by nuclear-armed countries in the South Asian Region, India’s decision to conduct nuclear test in 1998 was justified by the Indian government in terms of safeguarding national security. India first tested a nuclear device in 1974. 2. Strengthen International Norms: India’s security strategy has been to strengthen international norms and international institutions to protect its security interests. India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru supported the cause of Asian solidarity, decolonisation, disarmament and the UN as a forum in which international conflicts could be settled. Most importantly it used non-alignment to help carve out an area of peace outside the bloc politics of the two superpowers. India joined 160 countries that have signed and ratified the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which provides a road map for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases to check global warming. Indian troops have been sent abroad on UN peacekeeping missions in support of cooperative security initiatives. 3. Internal Security: The third component of Indian security strategy is geared towards meeting security challenges within the country. Several militant groups from areas such as Nagaland, Mizoram, Punjab and Kashmir among others have, from time to time sought to break away from India. India has tried to preserve national unity by adopting a democratic political system, which allows different communities and groups of people to freely articulate their grievances and share political power. 4. Economic Growth: There has been an attempt in India to develop its economy in a way that the vast mass of citizens are lifted out of poverty and misery and huge economic inequalities are not allowed to exist. The attempt has not quite succeeded; we are still a very poor and unequal country. Yet democratic politics allows spaces for articulating the voice of the poor and the deprived citizens. There is a pressure on the democratically elected governments to combine economic growth with human

What is meant by traditional notions of internal and external security? Explain. ,"Traditional notion of internal security: The traditional notion of internal security stems from the security of a country within its borders. The nations stem from security  from internal rebellion, dissent and other forms of attacks. After 1945, USA, Soviet Union and Europe began to see security within their internal borders while newly independent countries such as from Asia and Africabegan to see civil wars, internal uprisings, etc. within their borders. Traditional notion of external security: The traditional notion of external security stems from protecting the territorial integrity of a nation from aggression and balance of power with other nations. This notion was seen dominant till the Second World War in North America and Europe but is still continuing in Asia and Africa.  ","Alliance building comes under traditional security. Many countries are involved in an alliance. They take steps in the direction of preventing war or defend against military attack. It aims at national interests. Q.13. What are the choices available to a state when its security is threatened, according to traditional security perspective? [NCERT] Ans. In the traditional conception of security, the greatest danger to a country is from military threats. The source of this danger is another country which by threatening military action endangers the core values of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. Agriculture, trade, business and industries of the region of war are affected adversely. Quite often, ordinary women and men are made targets of war to break their support to the war. In responding to the threat of a war, a government has three basic choices: 1. To surrender 2. To prevent the other side from attacking by promising to raise the costs of war to an unacceptable level; 3. To defend itself when war actually breaks out so as to deny the attacking country its objectives. Q.14. Distinguish between the internal and external notion of traditional security. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Internal notion of traditional security: (i) Internal military conflicts.
 (ii) Separatist movements: Internally, these states feared threats from separatist movements which wanted to form independent states. Sometimes, both external and internal threats submerged. This was because a neighbour might aid and abet internal separatist movements leading to tension between the two neighbouring states. (iii) Internal wars: Internal wars now account for more than 95% of the armed conflicts all over the world. There has been a steep rise twelve times in the number of civil wars, between 1946 and 1991 the highest jump in over 200 years. External notion of traditional security: (i) Danger to a country from military threats The source of such a security threat emerges from another country which, through its military action, threatens the core values of sovereignity, independence and territorial integrity. Military action even endangers the life of ordinary residents of a country. In a war, it is highly unlikely that only soldiers would die or be hurt. In all the likelihood, men and women, who are ordinary citizens and soft targets are made victims in a war, to break their support for the war. (ii) Deterrence, defence and balance of power Governments may even make the choice of surrender when actually in a war, but this may not be promoted as a country’s defence policy. Security policy, is hence, concerned with preventing war, which is known as deterrence, and with limiting or ending war, which is called defence. (iii) Alliance building as components of traditional security An alliance is a coalition of countries to deter or defend themselves unitedly against any possible military attack. Most alliances are formal written treaties based on a clear identification of potential threatening countries. Countries form military alliances to revitalise their effective power strength against other possible military alliance threats. (Any two points) Q.15. Nuclear weapons as deterrence or defence have limited usage against contemporary security threats to states. Explain the statement. [NCERT] Ans. Non-traditional notions of security go beyond military threats to include a wide range of threats and dangers affecting the conditions of human existence. These threats are poverty, epidemic, global warming, etc. Military attack causes threat not only the country but also affects whole human existence. Hunger, disease and natural disasters kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined. When war was considered as the greatest threat condition to the security, it occurred due to nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are of no use in front of these threats at present. They cannot contribute in any way to solve them. Q.16. Rapid environmental degradation is causing a serious threat to security. Do you agree with the statement? Substantiate your arguments.
 2. Arms Control: Arms Control regulates the acquisition or development of weapons. The Anti-ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 1972 tried to stop the United States and Soviet Union from using ballistic missiles as a defensive shield to launch a nuclear attack. While it did allow both countries to deploy a very limited number of defensive systems, it stopped them from large-scale production of those systems.

The Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 was an arms control treaty in the sense that it regulated the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Those countries that had tested and manufactured nuclear weapons before 1967were allowed to keep their weapons; and those that had done to were to give up the right to acquire them. 3. Confidence Building: Traditional security also accepts confidence building as a means of avoiding violence. Confidence building is a process in which countries share ideas and information with their rivals. They tell each other about their military intentions and, upto a point, their military plans. This is a way of show that they are not planning a surprise attack. They also update each other about the kind of forces they possess, and they may share information on where those forces are deployed. In short, confidence building is a process designed to ensure that countries do not go to war through misunderstanding or misperception. All in all, traditional conceptions of security are principally concerned with the use or threat of use of military force. In traditional security, force is both the principal threat to security and the principal means of achieving security. Q.5. Explain non-traditional conception of security. Ans. 1. Human security: Human security is all about the protection of people more than the protection of countries. Human security and state security should be same. But secure states do not automatically mean secure peoples. Protecting citizens from foreign attack may be a necessary condition for the security of individuals, but it is certainly not a sufficient one.

Describe any two major issues between India and Pakistan which led to war of 1971. ,"War of 1971 held because of two main reasons: (i) Refugee problem in 1971: A disintegrated Pakistan came in elections of 1970. Parties of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Sheikh Mujibur succeeded in Western and Eastern Pakistan respectively. Bengali population of eastern Pakistan voted heavily against Western Pakistan. Rulers of Western Pakistan considered citizens of eastern Pakistan as ‘another level’ citizens. Pakistan didn’t consider decision of democracy taken by eastern Pakistan valid. They also refused to convene the assembly of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Sheikh Mujibur was arrested and Pakistani army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. This led to a large scale migration into India, creating a huge refugee problem in India. The government of India supported people of east Pakistan. Consequently, India had a war with Pakistan. (ii) To support Bangladesh for its independence: In 1971, people of eastern Pakistan resented the domination of Western Pakistan and the imposition of an Urdu language. Thousands were killed by the Pakistani army which led to huge scale migration into India. India too gave them shelter. In addition to this, India support Bangladesh in its struggle for independence.

Pakistan strongly opposed this step of India and attacked on its airports on 3 December, 1971. Indian army too attacked Pakistan. Pakistan lost the war which resulted in the transformation of eastern Pakistan into newly independent country ‘Bangladesh’. Q.2. ‘Pakistan has witnessed both civilian and democratic system’. Explain. Ans. Pakistan has witnessed civilian system many times despite of citizens aspiration for democracy. In last 65 years, almost 29-30 years were ruled by civilians in Pakistan from 1947 to 2012. General Ayub Khan, General Yahya, General Zia-ul-Haq and General Pervez Musharraf were among the leaders of civil-rule. The first military rule inPakistan was established under the leadership of General Ayub Khan and was succeeded in announcing constitution ruler of Pakistan through the drama of elections. But he couldn’t befool public and public outrage increased. Unstability and dissatisfaction against him was increasing in Pakistan army. General Yahya took advantage, overthrew the government and himself became the dictator. Separation of eastern part of Pakistan and Pakistan’s defeat from India banished Yahya Khan from his power and an elected government under the leadership of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto came into power. Within the period of 7 years, Bhutto government was removed by General Zia-ul-Haq by a military revolution and was hanged after sometime.Dissatisfaction
 the Awami league led by Shiekh Mujib won all seats in East Pakistan and secured majority in the proposed constituent assembly for the whole of Pakistan. But the government dominated by the West Pakistan refused to convene the assembly. 4. Shiekh Mujib was arrested and under the military rule of General Yahya Khan, the Pakistani army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. This led to a large scale migration into India, creating huge refugee problem for India. 5. The government of India supported the demands of the people of east Pakistan for their Independence and helped them financially and militarily. 6.

Give a description of India-Sri Lanka relationship by describing ethnic conflicts of Sri Lanka. Ans. Sri Lanka is a small island located at South of India. Like India, Sri Lanka has successfully operated a democratic system since their independence from the British. But lives of the citizens have become bothersome due to ethnic conflicts. Sri Lanka has majority of Sri Lankan natives called ‘Sinhalas’. But a large number of Tamils, who had migrated from India to Sri Lanka are also settled there. They live mainly at Northeastern parts of Sri Lanka. The migration continued even after the independence. Majority of country, i.e., Sinhalas do not like Tamils living in Sri Lanka. They believe that Sri Lanka belongs to Sinhalas only. In 1964, ‘Shastri-Sinimavo Bandaranaike agreement’ was signed to solve the problem concerning Indian Tamils but that couldn’t be implemented properly.After some years, left wing extremists revolted against government in Sri Lanka and government was busy in suppressing them. The neglect and hatred of Tamil by Sinhalas led to fights. Violent fights took place between both communities in 1983. Sri Lankan army suppressed Tamils heartlessly. A serious reaction was seen on Tamilians. The ‘Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam’ (LTTE) was formed and demanded ‘Tamil Eelam’ or a separate country for the Tamils of SriLanka. Firing by aeroplanes in order to destroy Tamil’s military base by Sri Lankan government further worsened the situation. Pressure was put on Tamil Nadu government by Tamils to take measures in the direction of saving their interests and security. The difficulties in the relationship between the governments of India and Sri Lanka are mostly over ethnic conflict in the island nation. Indian leaders and citizens find it impossible to remain neutral when Tamils are politically unhappy and are being killed. After the military intervention in 1987, the Indian government now prefers a policy of disengagement visà-vis Sri Lanka’s internal troubles. India signed a free trade agreement with Sri Lanka, which strengthened relations between two-countries. India’s help in post-tsunami reconstruction in Sri Lanka has also brought the two countries closer. Q.10. Describe important issues or struggles held between India and Pakistan. Ans. Following struggles have taken place between India and Pakistan:

Attack on Kashmir: Pakistan occupied 2/5 part of the Kashmir by attacking India’s undivided Jammu-Kashmir in 1947. As India believes in the peace policy, the matter was raised in UNO by India.

On the other side, India, during the war of 1965 and 1971, released Pakistani regions such as Kashmir, Punjab and Sindh on the basis of Line of Control of 1948 in Jammu and Kashmir. But still, no cooperation could be seen from Pakistan’s side. Pakistan is hostile to India. It takes help of separatists of Jammu-Kashmir and Punjab.

As per the Tashkent agreement done with the help of Soviet Union, both the countries got ready to station their armies on the boundaries before war could start. In the end of 1971, Pakistan again attacked India but Pakistan had to pay for that. Its eastern alliance Bengal was no longer a part of Pakistan and it emerged as an independent country called ‘Bangladesh’. It was badly defeated by Western alliance and war ceased due to international interference. After the formation of BJP government in March 1998, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee tried to maintain better political relationship with Pakistan. Lahore Bus visit was done by him in February 1999 had this objective. But after some time, Pakistan attacked Kargil area of Jammu-Kashmir in May 1999.

Pakistan was suspended from the Commonwealth Organisation (Councils of Commonwealth) because of the unconstitutional overthrow of the democratically elected government of Pakistan as a serious violation of the commonwealth’s fundamental political principles (1999). The United States has withheld $50 million remaining in military reimbursements to Pakistan for fiscal year 2016 because it believes that Islamabad has not done enough to blunt the Islamist militant Haqqani network.

War of 1971 held because of two main reasons: (i) Refugee problem in 1971: A disintegrated Pakistan came in elections of 1970. Parties of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Sheikh Mujibur succeeded in Western and Eastern Pakistan respectively. Bengali population of eastern Pakistan voted heavily against Western Pakistan. Rulers of Western Pakistan considered citizens of eastern Pakistan as ‘another level’ citizens. Pakistan didn’t consider decision of democracy taken by eastern Pakistan valid. They also refused to convene the assembly of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Sheikh Mujibur was arrested and Pakistani army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. This led to a large scale migration into India, creating a huge refugee problem in India. The government of India supported people of east Pakistan. Consequently, India had a war with Pakistan. (ii) To support Bangladesh for its independence: In 1971, people of eastern Pakistan resented the domination of Western Pakistan and the imposition of an Urdu language. Thousands were killed by the Pakistani army which led to huge scale migration into India. India too gave them shelter. In addition to this, India support Bangladesh in its struggle for independence.

Both countries confessed that terrorism is a challenge in the path of peace and security in a Foreign Minister level discussion in July 2012. 6. Detainees of each others’ country are also released from time to time according to various agreements. Q.16. Why was the need of establishment of SAARC felt? Ans. Almost all superpowers tried to influence this region due to which these countries could not become united for mutual cooperation. Countries were seen under the influence of either America or Soviet Union. Tensions were seen among the countries of this region. These superpowers accelerated navy activities and established navy ports in the Indian ocean which led to fear of regional unstability among countries of the region. It was observed that if unity and cooperation among the countries of this region didn’t get establish, then these countries would be exploited by outside powers. It was also felt that mutual cooperation and help can pave the way of their development and can present a powerful region in front of the world. India considers the need of regional cooperation for international peace and order. An organisation of neighbouring countries of India was made in December 1985 for regional cooperation. It is known as ‘The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation’ (SAARC). Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are involved in SAARC. Its head office is in Kathmandu (Nepal). Q.17. How did citizens of Nepal succeed in establishing democracy? Ans. Nepal was a Hindu kingdom in the past and then a constitutional monarchy. Political parties and the common people of Nepal have wanted a more open and responsive system of government. But the king, with the help of the army, retained full control over the government and restricted the expansion of democracy in Nepal. Seigniorial system was there in Nepal till 1950. Rana-family made Nepal king a puppet of their hands. Nepal’s then king Tribhuvan, took shelter in Indian embassy situated at Kathmandu in 1950. In this way, seigniorial system in Nepal came to an end with the help of India and powers came in the hands of king of Nepal, paving way for democracy. From 1950 to 1990, constitutional monarchy was established in the Hindu region of Nepal. The topmost rights were given to the king in the government of Maharaja Tribhuvan, Mahendra, Virendra and Gyanendra. Democratic governments had also been setup several times in those 40 years. Either there was a parliamentary democraticsystem or Panchayat Democracy. But the king was given the topmost rights and powers.

India played a major role in the formation of Bangladesh. It was due to India’s efforts and immediate help from Soviet Union that Bangladesh gained membership of UNO. The governments of India and Bangladesh have had differences over several issues including the sharing of the Ganga and Brahmaputra river waters. The Indian government has been unhappy with Bangladesh’s denial of illegal immigration to India, its support for anti-Indian Islamic fundamentalist groups, Bangladesh’s refusal to allow Indian troops to move through its territory to northeastern India, and its decision not to export natural gas to India or allow Myanmar to do so through Bangladeshi territory. Bangladeshi governments have felt that the Indian government behaves like a regional bully over the sharing of river waters, encouraging rebellion in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, trying to extract its natural gas and being unfair in trade.

Give a description of India-Sri Lanka relationship by describing ethnic conflicts of Sri Lanka. Ans. Sri Lanka is a small island located at South of India. Like India, Sri Lanka has successfully operated a democratic system since their independence from the British. But lives of the citizens have become bothersome due to ethnic conflicts. Sri Lanka has majority of Sri Lankan natives called ‘Sinhalas’. But a large number of Tamils, who had migrated from India to Sri Lanka are also settled there. They live mainly at Northeastern parts of Sri Lanka. The migration continued even after the independence. Majority of country, i.e., Sinhalas do not like Tamils living in Sri Lanka. They believe that Sri Lanka belongs to Sinhalas only. In 1964, ‘Shastri-Sinimavo Bandaranaike agreement’ was signed to solve the problem concerning Indian Tamils but that couldn’t be implemented properly.After some years, left wing extremists revolted against government in Sri Lanka and government was busy in suppressing them. The neglect and hatred of Tamil by Sinhalas led to fights. Violent fights took place between both communities in 1983. Sri Lankan army suppressed Tamils heartlessly. A serious reaction was seen on Tamilians. The ‘Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam’ (LTTE) was formed and demanded ‘Tamil Eelam’ or a separate country for the Tamils of SriLanka. Firing by aeroplanes in order to destroy Tamil’s military base by Sri Lankan government further worsened the situation. Pressure was put on Tamil Nadu government by Tamils to take measures in the direction of saving their interests and security. The difficulties in the relationship between the governments of India and Sri Lanka are mostly over ethnic conflict in the island nation. Indian leaders and citizens find it impossible to remain neutral when Tamils are politically unhappy and are being killed. After the military intervention in 1987, the Indian government now prefers a policy of disengagement visà-vis Sri Lanka’s internal troubles. India signed a free trade agreement with Sri Lanka, which strengthened relations between two-countries. India’s help in post-tsunami reconstruction in Sri Lanka has also brought the two countries closer. Q.10. Describe important issues or struggles held between India and Pakistan. Ans.

Like India, Sri Lanka has successfully operated a democratic system since their independence from the British. But lives of the citizens have become bothersome due to ethnic conflicts. Sri Lanka has majority of Sri Lankan natives called ‘Sinhalas’. But a large number of Tamils, who had migrated from India to Sri Lanka are also settled there. They live mainly at Northeastern parts of Sri Lanka. The migration continued even after the independence. Majority of country, i.e., Sinhalas do not like Tamils living in Sri Lanka.

But still, no cooperation could be seen from Pakistan’s side. Pakistan is hostile to India. It takes help of separatists of Jammu-Kashmir and Punjab. Pakistani terrorists have come to Jammu-Kashmir and an undeclared war against India could be sensed. 3. Attack on Kutchh: In January 1965, Pakistan attacked Rann of Kutchh, region of Gujarat, India. War came to an end between both the countries in June 1965 due to international pressures. The matter was given to international judgement for final decision. The problem was thus resolved. 4.

India is worried of Pakistan’s initiated terrorism whereas Pakistan has differences with India over on the issue of Kashmir. SAARC has not been able to achieve success properlyas they shake hands but are not unified by their hearts.

Indo-Pak relations have become better from time to time but promotion to terrorism and separatists in India by Pakistan have made their relations bitter. Hence, no solution has been found out so far.","1. Country division and Violence: At the time of division of country, it was expected that demands of Mulsim league related to Pakistan would be met and peace would be established between both the countries. But this did not happen. Hindus and Sikhs bearing hair were pushed to India from Pakistan. Property of billions weredestroyed. Crores were displaced. Modesty of mothers and sisters was destroyed. Its reaction was seen in India as well and Muslims left India and settled Pakistan. 2. Attack on Kashmir: Pakistan occupied 2/5 part of the Kashmir by attacking India’s undivided Jammu-Kashmir in 1947. As India believes in the peace policy, the matter was raised in UNO by India. But Pakistan didn’t follow orders of security council. On the other side, India, during the war of 1965 and 1971, released Pakistani regions such as Kashmir, Punjab and Sindh on the basis of Line of Control of 1948 in Jammu and Kashmir. But still, no cooperation could be seen from Pakistan’s side. Pakistan is hostile to India. It takes help of separatists of Jammu-Kashmir and Punjab. Pakistani terrorists have come to Jammu-Kashmir and an undeclared war against India could be sensed. 3. Attack on Kutchh: In January 1965, Pakistan attacked Rann of Kutchh, region of Gujarat, India. War came to an end between both the countries in June 1965 due to international pressures. The matter was given to international judgement for final decision. The problem was thus resolved. 4. Indo-Pakistan War: On September 1965, Pakistan attacked Indian region, Kashmir. Indian army gave a befitted reply to Pakistan. 740 square miles instead of 240 square miles of India was occupied. Pakistan agreed to end the war due to international pressure and internal weeknesses. As per the Tashkent agreement done with the help of Soviet Union, both the countries got ready to station their armies on the boundaries before war could start. In the end of 1971, Pakistan again attacked India but Pakistan had to pay for that. Its eastern alliance Bengal was no longer a part of Pakistan and it emerged as an independent country called ‘Bangladesh’. It was badly defeated by Western alliance and war ceased due to international interference. After the formation of BJP government in March 1998, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee tried to maintain better political relationship with Pakistan. Lahore Bus visit was done by him in February 1999 had this objective. But after some time, Pakistan attacked Kargil area of Jammu-Kashmir in May 1999. Indian army showed bravery, freed each inch of land of India from the enemy. Pakistan had a setback at its political front and was isolated at international front. Pakistan was suspended from the Commonwealth Organisation (Councils of Commonwealth) because of the unconstitutional overthrow of the democratically elected government of Pakistan as a serious violation of the commonwealth’s fundamental political principles (1999). The United States has withheld $50 million remaining in military reimbursements to Pakistan for fiscal year 2016 because it believes that Islamabad has not done enough to blunt the Islamist militant Haqqani network. Indo-Pak relations continue to be stressful from the time of kargil war. All are aware of the fact that Pakistani terrorists are responsible for destructive activities
 in Jammu-Kashmir, India. As a result, relationships have become stressful and mutual discussions between the two countries have stopped. Q.11. Write about Pakistan’s changing relationship with India. [CBSE Delhi 2011] Ans. Indo-Pak changing relationship can be understood by the following points: 1. Pakistan attacked India in 1965 and India too gave a befitting reply. An agreement was signed by both of them in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, with the help of Soviet Union. As a result, Pakistan states, which were won by India, returned back to Pakistan. 2. In 1971, a war between India and Pakistan again took place concerning Bangladesh. Pakistan was badly defeated by India. In addition to this, East Pakistan broke away to emerge as an independent country called ‘Bangladesh’. Prime Ministers of both the countries (India and Pakistan) met at Shimla. A treaty called ‘Shimla Pact’ was signed by them. According to this, both the countries agreed to find solutions to the major problems peacefully. 3. Ministers and officials of India and Pakistan visited each others country in 1985. Agreements to improve agriculture, science and technology and trade were signed. Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi met Pakistani President, General Zia several times. But no solid outcome was observed. Ms. Benezir Bhutto became Prime Minister ofPakistan in 1988. It was expected that relationship between both the countries would become cordial due to democracy, but this didn’t happen.

Q.12. Describe common problems of South Asian countries. [CBSE (AI) 2011] Ans. 1. Some member countries of SAARC think that SAFTA is a way for India to ‘Invade’ the markets and to influence their societies and politics through commercial ventures and a commercial presence in their countries. On the other hand, India thinks that there are real economic benefits for all from SAFTA and that a region that trades more freely will be able to cooperate better on political issues. 2. SAARC countries have many internal conflicts. Conflicts over issues such as distribution of river waters and boundaries always continue to remain. India is worried of Pakistan’s initiated terrorism whereas Pakistan has differences with India over on the issue of Kashmir. SAARC has not been able to achieve success properlyas they shake hands but are not unified by their hearts.
 fight with LTTE. Shri Premdas became Presidentof Sri Lanka. He was completely against the presence of Indian army in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan citizens saw this as an India’s attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka. Indian Tamils were also unhappy with the proceedings being done against them (Sri Lankan Tamilians) by India. Sri Lankan President Premdasa openly demanded India to take back its armed forces on 29 July, 1989. Uncertainty and strain continued for some time in Sri Lanka. But in December 1989, after the formation of new government, Indian Peace Keeping Force was called back from Sri Lanka on 31 March, 1990. Q.14. What steps have been taken to normalise Indo-Pak relations by Indian rulers in last two decades? Ans. Pakistan’s support to terrorism in Kashmir still continues. Despite of this, Prime Minister Gujral tried to improve bilateral relations. Prime Minister Vajpayee did Lahore Bus Tour and signed Lahore announcement letter in order to promote harmony. In return to this, kargil war was held between both the countries as an undisclosed war. Agra-talks of 2001 failed and terrorist attack on Parliament in December 2001 inspired India to end all diplomatic relations with Pakistan. Pakistan’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) is alleged to be involved in managing in Anti-Indian campaigns. Diplomatic initiatives were again started in 2003 but this was a pain staking way and both the countries were heading for friendly solution carefully. This pause was broken down by Vajpayee’s visit to Islamabad and to start cricket between both countries again. A Re-evaluation of relationship of both the countries was proposed by Manmohan Singh (former Prime Minister of India). Hindrance was seen during Mumbai bomb blast in 2006 but both countries agreed to continue discussion. SAARC summit held at New Delhi 2007 paved way for peace and friendliness in this area between both the countries. They accepted that terrorisom is a challenge in the way of peace and security. When Pakistani Prime Minister visited India in 2014, people of both the countries hoped for a fresh start and improved relations. But Pakistan’s irresponsible attitude towards terrorism cannot be trusted upon. It agrees on eliminating terrorism but does not take any initiative. Instead, it promotes terrorism. Q.15. Mention some of the recent agreements between India and Pakistan. [NCERT] Ans. Although India-Pakistan relations seem revolving around conflicts, there have been a series of efforts to manage tensions and build peace. Following are the recent agreements between them: 1. India-Pakistan held differences over distribution of Indus river waters. Indus River Treaty was signed by India and Pakistan in 1960 by mediation of World Bank. Despite of the differences, the treaty is still in effect. 2. After Indo-Pak war of 1971, Shimla pact was signed by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Indira Gandhi.

Explain any three advantages of Globalisation with examples. ,"Three advantages of Globalisation are as follows: 1. Political Advantages: State also gains political benefit due to globalisation. State can work efficiently by collecting information about its citizen by technology. Globalisation intensifies closeness between countries. Event occurs in one part of the world and also affects other parts of the world. States become more powerful than they were earlier as a result of globalisation. The primary of the state continues to be the unchallenged basis of political community. The state continues to discharge its essential functions (Law and order, national security) and consciously withdraws from certain domains from which it wishes. With enhanced technologies available at the disposal of the state, they can collect information about its citizens. With this information, the state is able to rule better, not less able. Thus, state becomes more powerful. 2. Economic Advantages: Globalisation has involved greater trade in commodities across the globe; the restrictions imposed by different countries on allowing the imports of the other countries have been reduced. Similarly, the restrictions on the movement of Capital across countries have also been reduced. Now the investor can invest his money anywhere in the world. Advocates of economic globalisation argue that it generates greater economic growth and well being for larger sections of the population when there is de-regulation. Greater trade among countries allows each economy to do what it does the best. This would benefit the whole world. 3. Cultural Advantages: Globalisation leads to the rise of a uniform culture. Cultures are not static things. All culture accept outside influences all the time. Sometimes external influences simply enlarge our choices, and sometimes they modify our cultures without overwhelming the traditional. The burger is no substitute for a Sambhar Vada and, therefore, does not pose any real challenge. It is simply added on to our food choices. Blue jeans, on the other hand, can go well with a homespun khadi kurta. It is interesting that this unique combination has been exported back to the country that gave us blue jeans. Globalisation lead to each culture becoming more different and distinctive.","Q.1. Explain any three advantages of Globalisation with examples. [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans.

Globalisation lead to each culture becoming more different and distinctive. Q.2. What initiatives did India take for globalisation? Ans. India took the following initiatives for Globalisation: 1. Reforms in trade policy: These reforms in trade policy by India were carried out. •
 Q.1 What is globalisation? Enlighten any three reasons for globalisation. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Or Define globalisation. Explain any three reasons for globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Globalisation means globalise the social relationship in such a way that events taking place in some parts of the world could have an impact on another part of the world. Thus, globalisation is a process in which whole earth became a global village, in which socio-economic contact is based on mutual cooperation. Main reasons for Globalisation are as follows: 1. Revolution in Communication Technique: Technology remains a critical element. There is no doubt that the invention of telegraph, the telephone, and the microchip in more recent times has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. When printing initially came into being, it laid the basis for the creation of nationalism. Technology has affected us at individual and collective levels. Technological advancements have stimulated the transfer and movement of capital, thoughts, commodities and people from one part of the world to another and that too, easily. The movement of capital and commodities has been more than the movement of peoples across different parts of the world. 2. Flow of Capital and Commodities: Economic concept of the world has to play an important role in world politics. The mention of economic globalisation draws our attention immediately to the role of international institutions like IMF and the WTO and the role they play in determining economic policies across the world. Yet globalisation must not be viewed in such narrow terms. Economic globalisation involves many factors other than these international institutions. A much broader way of understanding of economic globalisation require us to look at the distribution of economic gains, i.e., who get the most from globalisation and who gets less, indeed who loses from it. 3. Impact of an event on all the people of World: Globalisation, however, does not emerge merely because of the availability of improved communications. What is important is for people in different parts of the world is to recognise these interconnections with the rest of the world. Currently, we are aware of the fact that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on the another part of the world. The Bird Flu or Tsunami is not confined to any particular nation. It does not respect national boundaries. Similarly, when major economic events take place, their
 impact is felt outside their immediate local, national or regional environment at the international level. Q.2. What is global ‘mutual connection’? What are its components? [NCERT] Ans. Global mutual connection means the free flow of ideas, capital commodities and people from one part of the world to another. In present times, different parts of world have come close to each other. And its credit goes to the development of means of communication. The invention of telegraph, the telephone and the microchips has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. Printing connected people living at different corners of the globe. But Globalisation however does not emerge merely because of the availability of improved communications. But people in different partsof the world recognise that they are connected to each other. Currently, we are aware of the fact that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on another part of the world like Bird Flu or Tsunami. Q.3. How do technologies contribute in the direction of globalisation? Explain. [CBSE Delhi 2013, CBSE Delhi 2015] Or How has technology contributed to the globalisation? [NCERT] Ans. Revolution in Communication Technique: Technology remains a critical element. There is no doubt that the invention of telegraph, the telephone, and the microchip in more recent times has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. When printing initially came into being, it laid the basis for the creation of nationalism. Technology has affected us at individual and collective levels. Technological advancements have stimulated the transfer and movement of capital, thoughts, commodities and people from one part of the world to another and that too, easily. The movement of capital and commodities has been more than the movement of peoples across different parts of the world. Q.4. Why is globalisation a multidimensional concept? Ans. Globalisation is a multidimensional concept because it cannot be limited within a certain sphere. Its effect can be seen in all the sectors like economic, political and cultural. It would be a blunder to accept globalisation only as an economic, political or a cultural event. The impact of globalisation is vastly uneven— it affects some parts more than others. Q.5. Define globalisation. Explain any one criticism for globalisation. [CBSE Delhi (C) 2014]
 Ans.Globalisation means globalise the social relationship in such a manner that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on another part of the world. Thus globalisation is a process in which whole earth became a global village, in which socioeconomic contact is based on mutual corporation. Apart from the sphere of economics and politics, Globalisation has affected us culturally. What we eat, drink, think and wear reflect our culture. Imposition of Western Culture on the rest of the world is leading the world to homogenous culture. It is the result of US Hegemony. Cultures seeking to buy into the dominant American dream is dangerous not only for poor countries but also for the whole of humanity, for it might lead to the shinkage of the rich cultural heritage of the entire globe. Q.6. Clarify any two positive and any two negative effects of globalisation. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. Two positive effects of globalisation are as follows: (i) As a consequence of globalisation, enhanced technologies are available with states. With these technologies, it has become easy for state to collect information about its citizens. (ii) Globalisation improves economical aspects. Economic policy of openness makes business flourish. The countries following these policies progress and prosper immensely. Negative effects of globalisation are as follows: (i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. (ii) Powerfully influenced by the American way of life, globalisation has given rise to the cultural pollution in many countries of the world. Q.7. Explain any four reasons for resistance to globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. Following are the reasons for the resistance to globalisation: (i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that make the rich richer and the poor poorer. (ii) Wea kening of the state leads to the reduction in the capacity of the state to protect the interests of its citizens, especially poor. (iii) Many countries also fear the weakening of state in political terms. Economically, they want a return to self-reliance and protectionism, at least in certain areas of the economy.

 (iv) They are worried about their traditional culture that it would be harmed and people will loose their age-old values and ways. Q.8. List any four advantages of economic globalisation. Ans. Following are the merits of economic globalisation: (i) Globalisation has involved greater trade in commodities across the globe; the restriction imposed by different countries on allowing the imports of other countries have been reduced. (ii) The restrictions on the movement of capital across countries have also been reduced. Now the investor can invest their money in any country. (iii) Advocates of economic globalisation argue that it generates greater economic growth and well-being for larger sections of the population when there is deregulation. (iv) Greater trade among countries allows each economy to do what it does best. This would benefit the whole world.

[CBSE (AI) 2014] Or Explain any three reasons for resistance to globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. The three bases that oppose globalisation in India are as follows:
 (i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. It should be kept in mind that always same results cannot be seen even after adopting the same policy. Different effects of it can be seen in the different parts of the world. Those who criticise globalisation have raised their voices that poor countries would lead to an extent of destruction. (ii) Weakening of the state leads to a reduction in the capacity of state to protect the interest of its poor. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. They point out that it is likely to benefit only a small section of the population while impoverishing those who were dependent on the government for jobs and welfare (education, health, sanitation, etc.) (iii) In political terms, they also fear the weakening of the state, economically they want a return to self-reliance and protectionism, at least in certain areas of the economy. Culturally, they are worried that traditional culture will be harmed and people will loose their age-old values and ways. (iv) Culturally, critics are worried that traditional culture, i.e., music, dress and language, etc. will be harmed and people will lose their age-old values and ways. Q.4. Describe any three effects of globalisation on the culture of a country. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. The effects of globalisation: (i) Globalisation has led to similar economic policies adopted by governments in different parts of the world that has generated vastly different outcomes in different parts of the world. (ii) It has involved greater trade in commodities across the globe; the restrictions imposed by different countries on allowing the imports of other countries have been reduced. Similarly, the restrictions on movement of capital across countries have also been reduced. (iii) Globalisation has led to the flow of ideas across national boundaries; spread of internet and computer related services is an example of that. (iv) Economic globalisation has created an intense division of opinion all over the world. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. (v) Globalisation generates greater economic growth and well being for larger sections of the population when there is deregulation. Greater trade among countries allows each economy to do what it does best. Q.5. How has globalisation affected India and what has been India’s response?
 [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. Impact of globalisation on India: Removal of trade barriers, reduction in taxes on goods have encouraged the investors to invest in India. Better services in the communication sector, many food processing units have entered the Indian market, foreign exchange reserves have increased due to FDI. India’s response to globalisation: Criticized by the leftists and the rightist wings or political parties, anti-globalisation movements government has made efforts to make globalisation more fairer so that it creates opportunities for all and also to ensure that benefits of globalisation are shared by all.

Disinvestment: India has done disinvestment in units in public sectors. Insurance sector was one such sector which was left open for competition. 7. Effect of World Trade Organisation: World Trade Organisation came into existence in 1995. Excise duty (tariff) was removed from majority of the Indian goods. 8. End of concession: Indian government came into its right form by not favouring concession and by ending its role as a regulator. Q.3. Explain any three bases that oppose globalisation in India. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Or Explain any three reasons for resistance to globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. The three bases that oppose globalisation in India are as follows:
 (i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. It should be kept in mind that always same results cannot be seen even after adopting the same policy. Different effects of it can be seen in the different parts of the world. Those who criticise globalisation have raised their voices that poor countries would lead to an extent of destruction. (ii) Weakening of the state leads to a reduction in the capacity of state to protect the interest of its poor.

Culturally, they are worried that traditional culture will be harmed and people will loose their age-old values and ways. (iv) Culturally, critics are worried that traditional culture, i.e., music, dress and language, etc. will be harmed and people will lose their age-old values and ways. Q.4. Describe any three effects of globalisation on the culture of a country. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. The effects of globalisation: (i) Globalisation has led to similar economic policies adopted by governments in different parts of the world that has generated vastly different outcomes in different parts of the world. (ii) It has involved greater trade in commodities across the globe; the restrictions imposed by different countries on allowing the imports of other countries have been reduced. Similarly, the restrictions on movement of capital across countries have also been reduced. (iii) Globalisation has led to the flow of ideas across national boundaries; spread of internet and computer related services is an example of that. (iv) Economic globalisation has created an intense division of opinion all over the world. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. (v) Globalisation generates greater economic growth and well being for larger sections of the population when there is deregulation. Greater trade among countries allows each economy to do what it does best. Q.5. How has globalisation affected India and what has been India’s response?

 [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. Impact of globalisation on India: Removal of trade barriers, reduction in taxes on goods have encouraged the investors to invest in India. Better services in the communication sector, many food processing units have entered the Indian market, foreign exchange reserves have increased due to FDI. India’s response to globalisation: Criticized by the leftists and the rightist wings or political parties, anti-globalisation movements government has made efforts to make globalisation more fairer so that it creates opportunities for all and also to ensure that benefits of globalisation are shared by all.

 impact is felt outside their immediate local, national or regional environment at the international level. Q.2. What is global ‘mutual connection’? What are its components? [NCERT] Ans. Global mutual connection means the free flow of ideas, capital commodities and people from one part of the world to another. In present times, different parts of world have come close to each other. And its credit goes to the development of means of communication. The invention of telegraph, the telephone and the microchips has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. Printing connected people living at different corners of the globe. But Globalisation however does not emerge merely because of the availability of improved communications. But people in different partsof the world recognise that they are connected to each other. Currently, we are aware of the fact that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on another part of the world like Bird Flu or Tsunami. Q.3. How do technologies contribute in the direction of globalisation? Explain. [CBSE Delhi 2013, CBSE Delhi 2015] Or How has technology contributed to the globalisation? [NCERT] Ans. Revolution in Communication Technique: Technology remains a critical element. There is no doubt that the invention of telegraph, the telephone, and the microchip in more recent times has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. When printing initially came into being, it laid the basis for the creation of nationalism. Technology has affected us at individual and collective levels. Technological advancements have stimulated the transfer and movement of capital, thoughts, commodities and people from one part of the world to another and that too, easily. The movement of capital and commodities has been more than the movement of peoples across different parts of the world. Q.4. Why is globalisation a multidimensional concept? Ans. Globalisation is a multidimensional concept because it cannot be limited within a certain sphere. Its effect can be seen in all the sectors like economic, political and cultural. It would be a blunder to accept globalisation only as an economic, political or a cultural event. The impact of globalisation is vastly uneven— it affects some parts more than others. Q.5. Define globalisation. Explain any one criticism for globalisation. [CBSE Delhi (C) 2014]
 Ans.Globalisation means globalise the social relationship in such a manner that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on another part of the world. Thus globalisation is a process in which whole earth became a global village, in which socioeconomic contact is based on mutual corporation. Apart from the sphere of economics and politics, Globalisation has affected us culturally. What we eat, drink, think and wear reflect our culture. Imposition of Western Culture on the rest of the world is leading the world to homogenous culture. It is the result of US Hegemony. Cultures seeking to buy into the dominant American dream is dangerous not only for poor countries but also for the whole of humanity, for it might lead to the shinkage of the rich cultural heritage of the entire globe. Q.6. Clarify any two positive and any two negative effects of globalisation. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. Two positive effects of globalisation are as follows: (i) As a consequence of globalisation, enhanced technologies are available with states. With these technologies, it has become easy for state to collect information about its citizens. (ii) Globalisation improves economical aspects. Economic policy of openness makes business flourish. The countries following these policies progress and prosper immensely. Negative effects of globalisation are as follows: (i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. (ii) Powerfully influenced by the American way of life, globalisation has given rise to the cultural pollution in many countries of the world. Q.7. Explain any four reasons for resistance to globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. Following are the reasons for the resistance to globalisation: (i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that make the rich richer and the poor poorer. (ii) Wea kening of the state leads to the reduction in the capacity of the state to protect the interests of its citizens, especially poor. (iii) Many countries also fear the weakening of state in political terms. Economically, they want a return to self-reliance and protectionism, at least in certain areas of the economy.

What were the reasons of emergence of Cold War? Explain any two.,"Difference in Opinions: Britain and France were no longer superpowers after Second World War. Two new blocs, Soviet Union and America originated that led capitalism and communal ideology, Russia wanted to spread communism and Socialism whereas America wanted to stop that. After Second World War, Eastern Europe came under the influence of communism under the direction of Soviet Union. Communism was spread not only in Germany, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, etc. but also in Northern Korea in Asia and up to China. This put America under fire. This led to difference in opinions between both the states to a large extent. This gave rise in the bitterness in relationship between both the countries to such an extent that both had suspected view points for each other. Distrust in their relationships led to the beginning of Cold War. Truman Policy: American President, Truman made a programme to help states of Western Europe to stop the influence of USSR. Truman felt that communism spreads only when the people are poor and victim. It can be stopped by providing financial help to the weaker section to make them prosper. In the year 1947, American StateSecretary, Marshal prepared a plan to provide million dollars financial assistance to Europe so that the losses done by war can be compensated. Had this not been done by America then all of these would have become a part of Soviet Union. The Western European countries were now capable to protect themselves from this.

In  other words, existence of tension, possibility of war but no war being witnessed and small incidents of struggle between military alliances of two superpower is known as Cold War. The superpowers had military alliance with smaller states due to the following reasons: • • •  Superpowers had military alliance with smaller countries so that superpowers could launch their weapons and troops from these countries. Superpowers used to spy the enemy countries from smaller countries. Smaller countries used to pay for the soldiers that were a part of military alliance. Due to this, economic pressure on the superpowers decreased. ","Q.1. Why War didn’t happen during Cold War? Ans. Due to the theory of deterrence. Q.2. Why did smaller states in the alliance link themselves on any of the superpowers? Ans. Self-protection and to limit the authority of other superpower. Q.3. What was the need of land-area of smaller countries to superpowers? Ans. To make the land area as base for the operation of their weapons and their military. Q.4. What was the greatest need of non-aligned countries? Ans. They needed to be economically more developed and improve the living standards of people by bringing them above poverty line. Q.5. What was the major change in nature of non-alignment? Ans. Economic issues received more importance. Q.6. Why did Indian government sign the treaty with Soviet Union in 1971? Ans. India needed diplomatic and possible military support during the Bangladesh crisis. Q.7. Why did both the blocs have huge stock of weapons during the Cold War? Ans. Cold War did not eliminate rivalries between the two alliances, mutual suspicions led them to arm themselves to the teeth and to constantly prepare for war. Huge stock of arms was considered necessary for the prevention of occurrence of war. Q.8. What were the changes in Global politics after the Second World War? Ans. After the Second World War, two new power rose on the global stage. With the defeat of Germany and Japan, the devastation of Europe and in many other parts of the world, the United States and USSR became the greatest powers in the world with the ability to influence events anywhere on earth. The two superpowers were keen on expanding their sphere of influence in different parts of the world. The world was visibly divided between the two alliance systems. Q.9. What was the Chief reason behind the Cold War? Ans. The superpowers emerged in the world after the Second World War. Both the countries wanted to take over the lead and this was the major cause for the Cold War.
 Both the superpowers had strong nuclear weapons. Both could have harmed each other in the case of a war. Q.10. What was the position of America in terms of global politics after the Second World War? Ans. America was a strong country after the Second World War. It had created its position as a superpower in global politics. Another superpower of the world was Soviet Union, who promoted communism. America established ‘North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’ by forming western alliance into an organisation in 1949. A foreign policy which aimed at stopping the promotion of communism in these countries was determined. Q.11. What were the reasons of starting/beginning of NAM? Ans. The whole world was divided into two camps after the Second World War and there was a competition between the superpowers to lead in weapons. Some newly independent countries wanted to maintain their independent existence by not involving in any of the blocs. That’s why, they got united and adopted the policy of non-alignment. As time passed by, other countries also started joining them. Q.12. What challenges did the countries of non-aligned movement face? Ans. Maximum countries involved in NAM were newly independent countries and thus they had to face two challenges: (i) To develop their countries economically (ii) To eliminate widespread poverty in the country. Q.13. Clarify the role played by non-aligned countries in reducing cold war conflicts and averting grave crises. Ans. The non-aligned countries played a very important role in reducing Cold War conflicts and averting some grave crises. Their contribution cannot be ignored. Jawaharlal Nehru – One of the key leaders of the NAM – played a crucial role in mediating between the two Koreas. In the Congo Crisis, the UN Secretary – General played a key mediatory role. Q.14. What was India’s response to the ongoing Cold War in two folds as the leader of NAM? Ans. As a leader of NAM, India’s response to the ongoing Cold War was two-fold: (i) It strongly and vigilantly stayed away from the two alliances. (ii) It raised its voice against the newly decolonised countries becoming a part of these alliances.
 Q.15. Why didn’t Cold War turn into bloody war in spite of rivalry between both the superpowers? Ans. Both the superpowers, America and Soviet Union had the capacity to completely destroy each other as they had enough nuclear weapons. This situation of ‘deterrence’ forced both the superpowers and then supporting countries to behave rationally and responsibly. They reacted like this because both of them knew the real consequences of war. Direct war could be highly destructive. Thus, the relation between both of them had deterrence relation. They behaved rationally to save the world from one another World War. Cold War and deterrence saved human lives during active confrontation of Cold War between both the superpowers. Q.16. Suppose there had been no Cold War, how would that situation have affected India’s foreign policy? [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. If the Cold War had not taken place, it would have affected Indian foreign policy in the following manners: (i) India would have retained the adopted independent foreign policy. (ii) Since the rivalry between many major powers would have increased hatred and enmity, India would have been compelled to join the arms race to become a strong nation to defend its independence and sovereignty. (iii) Indian would have become a superpower in Asia because of her large territory, human resource and strategic location. Q.17. Why did smaller countries decide to link themselves with any of the superpowers? Ans. Two Superpowers were keen on expanding their spheres of influence in different parts of the world. The world was sharply divided between the two alliance systems, a state was supposed to remain tied to its protective superpower to limit the influence of the other superpower and its allies. The smaller states in the alliances used the link to the superpowers for their own purposes. They got the promise of protection, weapons and economic aid against their local rivals (mostly they had rivalries). For these reasons, smaller states decided to join hands with these superpowers. Q.18. What was India’s own benefit in Non-Alignment Policy? Ans. A non-aligned stand served India’s interests in two ways: (i) Non-alignment allowed India to take international decisions and stances that served its interests rather than the interests of the super powers and their allies.

What was Cuban Missile Crises? Describe its events in Chronical Order. ,"Cuba is a small island nation off the coast of the United States. In 1962, Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of Soviet Union decided to place nuclear weapons in Cuba which put US under fire from close range. US president Kennedy was not willing for a full scale nuclear war. But for the safer sides of his country, he was determined to get Khrushchev to remove the missiles and nuclear weapon from Cuba. When Kennedy ordered American warships to intercept any Soviet ship heading to Cuba as a way of warning the USSR of his seriousness, then it seemed as if war would definitely come into existence. This is known as ‘Cubin Missile Crises’ but both the superpowers resolved the matter verbally and thus world was saved from ‘Third World War’. Cuban Missile Crises, 1962 was the most challenging year of Cold War. America even supported corrupt governments in order to stop communism. Batista’s government in Cuba was an example. This government was unrooted by Fidel Castro in 1959. Castro took help from USSR in order to become free from the control of America. America tried to enter in Cuba from ‘Bay of Pigs’. At the same time, in 1962, American spy ship took pictures of Russian Missile Base. Russian missiles in Cuba took the coin on their side. American President, John F Kennedy ordered his army to get prepared and asked Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev to remove the missiles. When Soviet warships with missiles headed towards Cuba, then world experienced the fear of first nuclear war between the two superpowers. Khrushchev said, “If president ensures that America would not attack on Cuba and would raise the besiegement, then no issue of missiles in Cuba would be there. We should not stretch those ends of rope where there are knots of war because the more we stretch, the more tighten the knot becomes.” American President Kennedy accepted proposal of Khrushchev and removed missiles and Russia removed missiles and sent them back to USSR. This was the end of that nuclear war which never took place. The close relationship between USA and USSR was developed after the end of crises. The establishment of hot line, a direct phone facility from Moscow to white house in 1983 was there. In the same year, both the superpowers signed limited Test Ban Treaty. Even after this, war took place between alliances, supported by the two superpowers in other parts of the world, but they tried to escape from one more another world war. Fortunately, Third World War didn’t take place.","Q.13. What was Cuban Missile Crises? [CBSE Delhi 2010, 2015, 2016] Ans. Cuba was a small island nation off the coast of Soviet Union and was an ally of the Soviet Union. In 1962, Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The installation of these weapons put the US under fire. The US President J.F. Kennedy was reluctant to nuclear war but was determined to get Khrushchev to remove the missile and nuclear weapons from Cuba in order to save his nation.

A clash seemed imminent in what came to be known as Cuban Missile Crises but both the sides decided to avoid war. Thus, the world was saved from Third World War.

Q.6. Describe New International Economic Order (NIEO). Ans. Most of the non-aligned countries were newly independent which had just now got freedom from colonial rules. Their economy was backward and poverty, unemployment and other such miseries were common. The non-aligned countries were more than merely mediators during the Cold War. The challenge for most of the non-aligned countries – a majority of them were categorized as LDCs (Least Developed Countries) were to be more developed economically and to lift their people out of poverty. Economic development was also vital for the independence of new-countries. The idea of NewInternational Economic Order (NIEO) originated with this realization.

Reduce the cost of technology from western countries. 4. Provide the LDCs with a greater role in international economic institutions. Gradually, the nature of non-alignment changed to greater importance to economic issues. In 1961, at the first summit in Belgrade, economic issues had not been very important. The fourth summit was held at Algiers in 1972 in which 72 countries participated. In this summit, due to demand for the formation of NIEO, NAM became an ‘economic pressure group’. Further summits were held at Havana (1979), New Delhi (1986), Belgrade (1989), Cartagena (1995), Kuala Lumpur (2003) and then again at Havana (2006) aimed at north-south convention based on equality and fairness. However, by the late 1980s, NIEO’s initiative started to fade because of the developed countries, who acted as a united group against. This occurred with the aim to maintain unity among nonaligned countries due to stiff opposition of developed countries.

 Q.8. What role did India play in Non-aligned movement? Ans. India played an important and creative role in the Cold war [1945-1990]. The credit of initiating and acting as a bridge in between both opposing camps during Cold war goes to first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru: This active and healthy foreign policy aimed at enhancing both; peace at global level and national interest. This movement also takes decision of international affairs on the basis of the merits and demerits by staying away from treaties of both the military alliances. This movement started at the international platform at Bandung summit in 1955 for the first time. Jawaharlal Nehru also played an important role in this matter. It was due to his initiative that Communist China was included at an international summit for the first time. Soon, India’s Jawaharlal Nehru, Yugoslavia’s Tito and Egypt’s Nasir were known as its spokesperson. It was due to Indians, initiative that prohibition on Nuclear weapons, imperialism and discrimination on the basis of colour was strongly opposed in Bandung summit. Africa fund and planet protection were also established. Q.9. What were the reforms of the global trading system proposed in the report entitled ‘Towards a New Trade Policy for Development’? Or Mention any four reforms proposed by UNCTAD in 1972 to reform the global trading system. [CBSE Sample Paper 2016] Ans. The non-aligned countries acted as mediators during the Cold War. Non-aligned countries were categorised as the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) as majority of them were poor and economically weak. Economic development was vital for newly independent countries to sustain freedom. They could have remained dependent on the richer countries including the colonial powers from which political freedom had been achieved.It was this condition which gave rise to the idea of a New International Economic Order (NIEO). The United Nations Conference and Trade and Development
 (UNCTAD) brought out a report in 1972 entitled. ‘Towards a New Trade Policy for Development’. The report proposed a reform of the global trading system. It aimed to: (i) Give the LDCs control over their natural resources exploited by the developed western countries. (ii) Obtain access to western markets so that the LDCs could sell their products and, therefore, mark trade more beneficial for the poorer countries. (iii) Reduce the cost of technology from the western countries and (iv) Provide the LDCs with a greater role in international economic institutions. Q.10. Write the history of Non-aligned Movement.
