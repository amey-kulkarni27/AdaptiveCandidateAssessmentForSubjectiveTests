Distinguish between autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria.,S. No. (i)  (ii) (iii)  Autotrophic Bacteria The bacteria synthe-sise their own food.  Heterotrophic Bacteria  They depend on an external sources of energy for synthesis of food. Autotrophic bacteria live on inorganic substrata.  An external source of energy is not required. Heterotrophic Bacteria live on organic substratum Or living host.  The bacteria obtain organic food or organic growth factors from outside sources. ,"Though the bacterial structure is very simple, they are very complex in behaviour. Compared to many other organisms, bacteria as a group show the most extensive metabolic diversity. Some of the bacteria are autotrophic, i.e., they synthesise their own food from inorganic substrates. They may be photosynthetic autotrophic or chemosynthetic autotrophic. The vast majority of bacteria are heterotrophs, i.e., they depend on other organisms or on dead organic matter for food.
 2.1.1 Archaebacteria These bacteria are special since they live in some of the most harsh habitats such as extreme salty areas (halophiles), hot springs (thermoacidophiles) and marshy areas (methanogens). Archaebacteria differ from other bacteria in having a different cell wall structure and this feature is responsible for their survival in extreme conditions. Methanogens are present in the gut of several ruminant animals such as cows and buffaloes and they are responsible for the production of methane (biogas) from the dung of these animals.

 2.1.2 Eubacteria There are thousands of different eubacteria or ‘true bacteria’. They are characterised by the presence of a rigid cell wall, and if motile, a flagellum. The cyanobacteria (also referred to as blue-green algae) have chlorophyll a similar to green plants and are photosynthetic autotrophs (Figure 2.2). The cyanobacteria are unicellular, colonial or filamentous, freshwater/marine or terrestrial algae. The colonies are generally surrounded by gelatinous sheath. They often form blooms in polluted water bodies. Some of these organisms can fix atmospheric nitrogen in specialised cells called heterocysts, e.g., Nostoc and Anabaena. Chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria oxidise various inorganic substances such as nitrates, nitrites and ammonia and use the released energy for their ATP production. They play a great role in recycling nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous, iron and sulphur. Heterotrophic bacteria are most abundant in nature. The majority are important decomposers. Many of them have a significant impact on human affairs. They are helpful in making curd from milk, production of antibiotics, fixing nitrogen in legume

Some of them such as Entamoeba are parasites. Flagellated protozoans: The members of this group are either free-living or parasitic. They have flagella. The parasitic forms cause diaseases such as sleeping sickness. Example: Trypanosoma. Ciliated protozoans: These are aquatic, actively moving organisms because of the presence of thousands of cilia. They have a cavity (gullet) that opens to the outside of the cell surface. The coordinated movement of rows of cilia causes the water laden with food to be steered into the gullet. Example: Paramoecium (Figure 2.4d). Sporozoans: This includes diverse organisms that have an infectious spore-like stage in their life cycle. The most notorious is Plasmodium (malarial parasite) which causes malaria, a disease which has a staggering effect on human population.

What are chemoautotrophic bacteria? How they obtain energy+?,"(i) Diatoms are an important source of food to aquatic animals. (ii) Diatomite is porous and chemically inert, therefore used in filtration of sugar, alcohols and antibiotics. (iii) It is also employed as a cleansing agent in tooth pastes and metal polishes. (iv) It is also employed as insulation material in refrigerators, boilers and furnaces.  ","2.2.1 Chrysophytes This group includes diatoms and golden algae (desmids). They are found in fresh water as well as in marine environments. They are microscopic and float passively in water currents (plankton). Most of them are photosynthetic. In diatoms the cell walls form two thin overlapping shells, which fit together as in a soap box. The walls are embedded with silica and thus the walls are indestructible. Thus, diatoms have left behind large amount of cell wall deposits in their habitat; this accumulation over billions of years is referred to as ‘diatomaceous earth’. Being gritty this soil is used in polishing, filtration of oils and syrups. Diatoms are the chief ‘producers’ in the oceans.

Name two features of Prokaryotes.,"Carolus Linnaeus anciently divided all living organisms into two kingdoms : Plantae and Animalia. The drawbacks of this classification are: (i) First formed animals were neither plants nor animals. (ii) Fungi differ in structure, physiology and reproductive details from plants. (iii) At lower level of organisation there are several instances where the distinction of plant and animal disappears .","All animals belonging to various phyla are assigned to the highest category called Kingdom Animalia in the classification system of animals. The Kingdom Plantae, on the other hand, is distinct, and comprises all plants from various divisions. Henceforth, we will refer to these two groups as animal and plant kingdoms. The taxonomic categories from species to kingdom have been shown in ascending order starting with species in Figure 1.1. These are broad categories. However, taxonomists have also developed sub-categories in this hierarchy to facilitate more sound and scientific placement of various taxa. Look at the hierarchy in Figure 1.1. Can you recall the basis of arrangement? Say, for example, as we go higher from species to kingdom, the number of common characteristics goes on

Write a short note on reproduction of blue-green algae.,"(i) Blue-green algae multiply asexually by binary fission, fragmentation or by the formation of small segments called hormogonia. (ii) Typical sexual reproduction is absent.","3.1.1 Chlorophyceae The members of chlorophyceae are commonly called green algae. The plant body may be unicellular, colonial or filamentous. They are usually grass green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and b. The pigments are localised in definite chloroplasts. The chloroplasts may be discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon-shaped in different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids located in the chloroplasts. Pyrenoids contain protein besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made of an inner layer of cellulose and an outer layer of pectose. Vegetative reproduction usually takes place by fragmentation or by formation of different types of spores. Asexual reproduction is by flagellated zoospores produced in zoosporangia. The sexual reproduction shows considerable variation in the type and formation of sex cells and it may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Some commonly found green algae are: Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Ulothrix, Spirogyra and Chara (Figure 3.1a).

Briefly describe the types of xylem.,"Depending upon the time of origin and internal structure, the xylem is of two types: (i) Protoxylem: It is first or easily formed xylem. It is made up of small tracheids and vessels, with annular or spiral thickenings. (ii) Metaxylem: It is later formed xylem. It consist of larger tracheids and vessels and have reticulate, scalariform and pitted thickenings.","The complex tissues are made of more than one type of cells and these work together as a unit. Xylem and phloem constitute the complex tissues in plants (Figure 6.3). Xylem functions as a conducting tissue for water and minerals from roots to the stem and leaves. It also provides mechanical strength to the plant parts. It is composed of four different kinds of elements, namely, tracheids, vessels, xylem fibres and xylem parenchyma. Gymnosperms lack vessels in their xylem. Tracheids are elongated or tube like cells with thick and lignified walls and tapering ends. These are dead and are without protoplasm. The inner layers of the cell walls have thickenings which vary in form. In flowering plants, tracheids and vessels are the main water transporting elements. Vessel is a long cylindrical tube-like structure made up of many cells called vessel members, each with lignified walls and a large central cavity. The vessel cells are also devoid of protoplasm. Vessel members are interconnected through perforations in their common walls. The presence of vessels is a characteristic feature of angiosperms. Xylem fibres have highly thickened walls and obliterated central lumens. These may either be septate or aseptate. Xylem parenchyma cells are living and thin-walled, and their cell walls are made up of cellulose. They store food materials in the form of starch or fat, and other substances like tannins. The radial conduction of water takes place by the ray parenchymatous cells. Primary xylem is of two types – protoxylem and metaxylem. The first formed primary xylem elements are called protoxylem and the later formed primary xylem is called metaxylem. In stems, the protoxylem lies towards the centre (pith) and the metaxylem lies towards the periphery of the organ. This type of primary xylem is called endarch. In roots, the protoxylem lies towards periphery and metaxylem lies towards the centre. Such arrangement of primary xylem is called exarch. Phloem transports food materials, usually from leaves to other parts of the plant. Phloem in angiosperms is composed of sieve tube elements, companion cells, phloem parenchyma

What are tissues? What are their main groups?,"Tissue: A group of similar or dissimilar cells having a common origin and co-operating with one another to perform a similar or a set of similar functions is called a tissue. Plant tissues have been classified into two fundamental types: (1) Meristematic tissue: These are the tissues which are made up of group of immature and similar cells and are in continuous state of division, forming new cells. (2) Permanent tissue: These are composed of mature cells which have definite shape, size and functions and have lost the power of divisions.","6.1 THE TISSUES A tissue is a group of cells having a common origin and usually performing a common function. A plant is made up of different kinds of tissues. Tissues are classified into two main groups, namely, meristematic and permanent tissues based on whether the cells being formed are capable of dividing or not.

Write any three main functions of parenchymatous tissues.,"(i) Parenchyma cells contain chloroplasts and take part in photosynthesis, so they are known as chlorenchyma. Thus, they are meant for storage of food. (ii) Paremchyma have fibre like prosenchyma which is meant for providing turgidity and strength. (iii) Parenchyma in aquatic plants possess air spaces, and are known as aerenchyma which stores air and provides buoyancy to aquatic plants.","A simple tissue is made of only one type of cells. The various simple tissues in plants are parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma (Figure 6.2). Parenchyma forms the major component within organs. The cells of the parenchyma are generally isodiametric. They may be spherical, oval, round, polygonal or elongated in shape. Their walls are thin and made up of cellulose. They may either be closely packed or have small intercellular spaces. The parenchyma performs various functions like photosynthesis, storage, secretion. The collenchyma occurs in layers below the epidermis in most of the dicotyledonous plants. It is found either as a homogeneous layer or in patches. It consists of cells which are much thickened at the corners due to a deposition of cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. Collenchymatous cells may be oval, spherical or polygonal and often contain chloroplasts. These cells assimilate food when they contain chloroplasts. Intercellular spaces are absent. They provide mechanical support to the growing parts of the plant such as young stem and petiole of a leaf. Sclerenchyma consists of long, narrow cells with thick and lignified cell walls having a few or numerous pits. They are usually dead and without protoplasts. On the basis of variation in form, structure, origin and development, sclerenchyma may be either fibres or sclereids. The fibres are thick-walled, elongated and pointed cells, generally occuring in groups, in various parts of the plant. The sclereids are spherical, oval or cylindrical, highly thickened dead cells with very

(1) What is periderm? How does periderm formation take place in dicot? (ii) How are vascular bundles arranged in monocot root?,"(i) Periderm: The cork, cork cambium and secondary cortex collectively form a protective tissue called periderm. In order to increase in girth and prevent rupturing of the outer ground tissues due to the formation of secondary vascular tissues, dicot stems produce a cork cambium or phellogen in the outer cortical cells. Phellogen cells divide on both the outer side as well as the inner side to form secondary tissue. The secondary tissue produced on the inner side of the phellogen is parenchymatous. It is called secondary cortex or phelloderm. Phellogen produce cork or phellem on the outer side. The phelloderm, phellogen and phellem together constitute the periderm. (ii) The vascular bundles are arranged in the form of ring around the central pit. The xylem bundles are exarch, i.e., protoxylem lies towards the outer side while the metaxylem faces inwards. Phloem bundles alternate with xylem bundles.","The growth of the roots and stems in length with the help of apical meristem is called the primary growth. Apart from primary growth most dicotyledonous plants exhibit an increase in girth. This increase is called the secondary growth. The tissues involved in secondary growth are the two lateral meristems: vascular cambium and cork cambium.
 6.4.1 Vascular Cambium The meristematic layer that is responsible for cutting off vascular tissues – xylem and pholem – is called vascular cambium. In the young stem it is present in patches as a single layer between the xylem and phloem. Later it forms a complete ring. 6.4.1.1 Formation of cambial ring In dicot stems, the cells of cambium present between primary xylem and primary phloem is the intrafascicular cambium.
 As the stem continues to increase in girth due to the activity of vascular cambium, the outer cortical and epidermis layers get broken and need to be replaced to provide new protective cell layers. Hence, sooner or later, another meristematic tissue called cork cambium or phellogen develops, usually in the cortex region. Phellogen is a couple of layers thick. It is made of narrow, thin-walled and nearly rectangular cells. Phellogen cuts off cells on both sides. The outer cells differentiate into cork or phellem while the inner cells differentiate into secondary cortex or phelloderm. The cork is impervious to water due to suberin deposition in the cell wall. The cells of secondary cortex are parenchymatous. Phellogen, phellem, and phelloderm are collectively known as periderm. Due to activity of the cork cambium, pressure builds up on the remaining layers peripheral

 The activity of cambium is under the control of many physiological and environmental factors. In temperate regions, the climatic conditions are not uniform through the year. In the spring season, cambium is very active and produces a large number of xylary elements having vessels with wider cavities. The wood formed during this season is called spring wood or early wood. In winter, the cambium is less active and forms fewer xylary elements that have narrow vessels, and this wood is called autumn wood or late wood. The spring wood is lighter in colour and has a lower density whereas the autumn wood is darker and has a higher density. The two kinds of woods that appear as alternate concentric rings, constitute an annual ring. Annual rings seen in a cut stem give an estimate of the age of the tree. 6.4.1.4

 Heartwood and sapwood
 Heartwood and sapwood
 In old trees, the greater part of secondary xylem is dark brown due to deposition of organic compounds like tannins, resins, oils, gums, aromatic substances and essential oils in the central or innermost layers of the stem. These substances make it hard, durable and resistant to the attacks of microorganisms and insects. This region comprises dead elements with highly lignified walls and is called heartwood. The heartwood does not conduct water but it gives mechanical support to the stem. The peripheral region of the secondary xylem, is lighter in colour and is known as the sapwood. It is involved in the conduction of water and minerals from root to leaf.

Describe the types of vascular bundle found in angiosperms. ,"Types of vascular bundles in angiosperms: In angiosperms vascular bundles occur in distinct patches. Based on the arrangement in the plant body. These are radial in roots and conjoint in case of stems and leaves. (i) Radial Bundles: Here xylem and phloem are arranged separately in different radii, called xylem bundles and phloem bundles. (ii) Conjoint Bundles: In this type, the xylem and phloem lie together on the same radius with phloem on the outer side and xylem towards the inner side Based on the presence or absence of cambium, vascular bundles are divided into open and closed vascular bundles. When a strip of cambium is present between xylem and phloem, they are called as open bundles while if cambium strip is absent between xylem and phloem, they are called closed bundles. Open bundles are characteristics of dicot plants whereas closed bundles are characteristics of monocot plants only.","The vascular system consists of complex tissues, the phloem and the xylem.The xylem and phloem together constitute vascular bundles (Figure 6.5). In dicotyledonous stems, cambium is present between phloem and xylem. Such vascular bundles because of the presence of cambium possess the ability to form secondary xylem and phloem tissues, and hence are called open vascular bundles. In the monocotyledons, the vascular bundles have no cambium present in them. Hence, since they do not form secondary tissues they are referred to as closed. When xylem and phloem within a vascular bundle are arranged in an alternate manner along the different radii, the arrangement is called radial such as in roots. In conjoint type of vascular bundles, the xylem and phloem are jointly situated along the same radius of vascular bundles. Such vascular bundles are common in stems and leaves. The conjoint vascular bundles usually have the phloem located only on the outer side of xylem.

(iv) The cells of the Pericycle just outside the protoxylem also become meristematic and joins with the cambium strips to form a wavy band of cambium ring. (v) This cambium ring form secondary xylem on the inner side and secondary phloem on the outer side. (vi) The cambium is always more active towards the inner side during the formation of secondary vascular tissues.","The growth of the roots and stems in length with the help of apical meristem is called the primary growth. Apart from primary growth most dicotyledonous plants exhibit an increase in girth. This increase is called the secondary growth. The tissues involved in secondary growth are the two lateral meristems: vascular cambium and cork cambium.
 6.4.1 Vascular Cambium The meristematic layer that is responsible for cutting off vascular tissues – xylem and pholem – is called vascular cambium. In the young stem it is present in patches as a single layer between the xylem and phloem. Later it forms a complete ring. 6.4.1.1 Formation of cambial ring In dicot stems, the cells of cambium present between primary xylem and primary phloem is the intrafascicular cambium.
 6.4.3 Secondary Growth in Roots In the dicot root, the vascular cambium is completely secondary in origin. It originates from the tissue located just below the phloem bundles, a portion of pericycle tissue, above the protoxylem forming a complete and continuous wavy ring, which later becomes circular (Figure 6.11). Further events are similar to those already described above for a dicotyledon stem.
 "
Distinguish between primary and secondary meristems.,"S. No.  Primary meristems  Secondary meristems  (i)  It originates from embroyonal meristem. Example are root apex and shoot apex.  It originates from permanent tissues by regaining of meristematic activity. Examples are cambium and vascular.  (ii)  Made of isodiametric cells. No large vacuoles are found.  Consist of tangentially elongated cells having rectangular outerline in section and possess vacuoles.  (iii)  It gives rise to all primary tissues including intrafascicular cambium.  It forms secondary xylem, secondary phloem, secondary cortex and cock.  (iv)  It is responsible for longitudinal growth.  It causes radial growth of stems and roots. ","Root apical meristem occupies the tip of a root while the shoot apical meristem occupies the distant most region of the stem axis. During the formation of leaves and elongation of stem, some cells ‘left behind’ from shoot apical meristem, constitute the axillary bud. Such buds are present in the axils of leaves and are capable of forming a branch or a flower. The meristem which occurs between mature tissues is known as intercalary meristem. They occur in grasses and regenerate parts removed by the grazing herbivores. Both apical meristems and intercalary meristems are primary meristems because they appear early in life of a plant and contribute to the formation of the primary plant body. The meristem that occurs in the mature regions of roots and shoots of many plants, particularly those that produce woody axis and appear later than primary meristem is called the secondary or lateral meristem. They are cylindrical meristems. Fascicular vascular cambium, interfascicular cambium and cork-cambium are examples of lateral meristems. These are responsible for producing the secondary tissues. Following divisions of cells in both primary and as well as secondary meristems, the newly formed cells become structurally and functionally specialised and lose the ability to divide. Such cells are termed permanent or mature cells and constitute the permanent tissues. During the formation of the primary plant body, specific regions of the apical meristem produce dermal tissues, ground tissues and vascular tissues.
 "
What is the significance of secondary growth?,"The significance of secondary growth are: (i) The secondary growth adds girth to the plant. It provides support by increasing width of the aerial growth. (ii) It produces a corky bark around the tree trunk that protects the interior parts from abrasion, heat cold and infection. (iii) It adds new conducting tissues for replacing old non-functioning ones as well as for meeting increased demand for long distance transport of sap and organic nutrients.  ","6.4 SECONDARY GROWTH

 The growth of the roots and stems in length with the help of apical meristem is called the primary growth. Apart from primary growth most dicotyledonous plants exhibit an increase in girth. This increase is called the secondary growth. The tissues involved in secondary growth are the two lateral meristems: vascular cambium and cork cambium.

"In angiosperms, sieve tubes are associated with specialized cells of parenchyma. Name the cells and briefly write how do they function.","Trichomes are hairs which are often found as epidermal outgrowths. The hairs of aerial parts may be unicellular or multicellular, branched or unbranched. Function (i) They enclose stationary air and protect the plant organ against water loss and sudden fluctuation in atmospheric temperature. (ii) In some plants, the hairs are glandular which secrete essential oil and provide characteristic odours to the plant. e.g., Citrus, Ocimum etc.","The cells of epidermis bear a number of hairs. The root hairs are unicellular elongations of the epidermal cells and help absorb water and minerals from the soil. On the stem the epidermal hairs are called trichomes. The trichomes in the shoot system are usually multicellular. They may be branched or unbranched and soft or stiff. They may even be secretory. The trichomes help in preventing water loss due to transpiration.
 "
Why are xylem and phloem called complex ,"Xylem and phloem are called complex tissues because they contain more than one type of cells, which perform vital functions in plants.","Complex Tissues
 The complex tissues are made of more than one type of cells and these work together as a unit. Xylem and phloem constitute the complex tissues in plants (Figure 6.3). Xylem functions as a conducting tissue for water and minerals from roots to the stem and leaves. It also provides mechanical strength to the plant parts. It is composed of four different kinds of elements, namely, tracheids, vessels, xylem fibres and xylem parenchyma. Gymnosperms lack vessels in their xylem. Tracheids are elongated or tube like cells with thick and lignified walls and tapering ends. These are dead and are without protoplasm. The inner layers of the cell walls have thickenings which vary in form. In flowering plants, tracheids and vessels are the main water transporting elements. Vessel is a long cylindrical tube-like structure made up of many cells called vessel members, each with lignified walls and a large central cavity. The vessel cells are also devoid of protoplasm. Vessel members are interconnected through perforations in their common walls. The presence of vessels is a characteristic feature of angiosperms. Xylem fibres have highly thickened walls and obliterated central lumens. These may either be septate or aseptate. Xylem parenchyma cells are living and thin-walled, and their cell walls are made up of cellulose. They store food materials in the form of starch or fat, and other substances like tannins. The radial conduction of water takes place by the ray parenchymatous cells. Primary xylem is of two types – protoxylem and metaxylem. The first formed primary xylem elements are called protoxylem and the later formed primary xylem is called metaxylem. In stems, the protoxylem lies towards the centre (pith) and the metaxylem lies towards the periphery of the organ. This type of primary xylem is called endarch. In roots, the protoxylem lies towards periphery and metaxylem lies towards the centre. Such arrangement of primary xylem is called exarch. Phloem transports food materials, usually from leaves to other parts of the plant. Phloem in angiosperms is composed of sieve tube elements, companion cells, phloem parenchyma
 Why are xylem and phloem called complex tissues?
 "
Distinguish between a dicot and a monocot leaf.,"S. No.  Dicot leaf  Monocot leaf  (i)  It is dorsoventral leaf.  It is isobilateral leaf.  (ii)  Stomata found only on lower epidermis.  (iii)  Reticulate leaf venation.  Stomata is found both on lower and upper epidermis. Parallel leaf venation.  (iv)  Mesophyll is differentiated into spongy and palisade tissues. E.g., Dicot plants.  Mesophyll not divided into spongy and palisade tissues. E.g., Monocot plants. ","The monocot stem has a sclerenchymatous hypodermis, a large number of scattered vascular bundles, each surrounded by a sclerenchymatous bundle sheath, and a large, conspicuous parenchymatous ground tissue (Figure 6.7b). Vascular bundles are conjoint and closed. Peripheral vascular bundles are generally smaller than the centrally located ones. The phloem parenchyma is absent, and water-containing cavities are present within the vascular bundles.
 6.3.5 Dorsiventral (Dicotyledonous) Leaf The vertical section of a dorsiventral leaf through the lamina shows three main parts, namely, epidermis, mesophyll and vascular system. The epidermis which covers both the upper surface (adaxial epidermis) and lower surface (abaxial epidermis) of the leaf has a conspicuous cuticle. The abaxial epidermis generally bears more stomata than the adaxial epidermis. The latter may even lack stomata. The tissue between the upper and the lower epidermis is called the mesophyll. Mesophyll, which possesses chloroplasts and carry out photosynthesis, is made up of parenchyma. It has two types of cells – the palisade parenchyma and the spongy parenchyma. The adaxially placed palisade parenchyma is made up of elongated cells, which are arranged vertically and parallel to each other. The oval or round and loosely arranged spongy parenchyma is situated below the palisade cells and extends to the lower epidermis. There are numerous large spaces and air cavities between these cells. Vascular system includes vascular bundles, which can be seen in the veins and the midrib. The size of the vascular bundles are dependent on the size of the veins. The veins vary in thickness in the reticulate venation of the dicot leaves. The vascular bundles are surrounded by a layer of thick walled bundle sheath cells. Look at Figure 6.8 (a) and find the position of xylem in the vascular bundle.
 isobilateral leaf, the stomata are present on both the surfaces of the epidermis; and the mesophyll is not differentiated into palisade and spongy parenchyma (Figure 6.8 b). In grasses, certain adaxial epidermal cells along the veins modify themselves into large, empty, colourless cells. These are called bulliform cells. When the bulliform cells in the leaves have absorbed water and are turgid, the leaf surface is exposed. When they are flaccid due to water stress, they make the leaves curl inwards to minimise water loss. The parallel venation in monocot leaves is reflected in the near similar sizes of vascular bundles (except in main veins) as seen in vertical sections of the leaves.

What is radial vascular bundles. Where it is found?,"In radian vascular bundles, xylem and phloem are arranged separately in different radii. Radial bundles are found in roots of monocots and dicots.  ","The vascular system consists of complex tissues, the phloem and the xylem.The xylem and phloem together constitute vascular bundles (Figure 6.5). In dicotyledonous stems, cambium is present between phloem and xylem. Such vascular bundles because of the presence of cambium possess the ability to form secondary xylem and phloem tissues, and hence are called open vascular bundles. In the monocotyledons, the vascular bundles have no cambium present in them. Hence, since they do not form secondary tissues they are referred to as closed. When xylem and phloem within a vascular bundle are arranged in an alternate manner along the different radii, the arrangement is called radial such as in roots. In conjoint type of vascular bundles, the xylem and phloem are jointly situated along the same radius of vascular bundles. Such vascular bundles are common in stems and leaves. The conjoint vascular bundles usually have the phloem located only on the outer side of xylem.
 "
What are the cell inclusions in a prokaryotic cell?,"(i) Inclusion bodies are storage granules which store reserves. (ii) They are not bounded by any membrane and lie free in the cytoplasm. (iii) The inclusion bodies are of three types-gas vacuoles, inorganic inclusions and food reserves. (iv) Gas vacuoles are permeable to atmospheric gases. (v) Inorganic inclusions are inorganic granules which take different colour with basic dyes. (vi) Food reserve are granules with storage of starch, proteins etc.","diffusion is very specific: it allows cell to select substances for uptake. It is sensitive to inhibitors which react with protein side chains. The proteins form channels in the membrane for molecules to pass through. Some channels are always open; others can be controlled. Some are large, allowing a variety of molecules to cross. The porins are proteins that form large Uniport A pores in the outer membranes of the plastids, mitochondria and some bacteria allowing molecules up to the size of small proteins to pass through. Figure 11.1 shows an extracellular A molecule bound to the transport protein; Antiport the transport protein then rotates and releases the molecule inside the cell, e.g., water channels – made up of eight different types of aquaporins. A Symport 11.1.2.1 Passive symports and B antiports Some carrier or transport proteins allow diffusion only if two types of molecules move together. In a symport, both molecules cross the membrane in the same direction; in an antiport, they move in opposite directions (Figure 11.2). When a

 8.4.2 Ribosomes and Inclusion Bodies In prokaryotes, ribosomes are associated with the plasma membrane of the cell. They are about 15 nm by 20 nm in size and are made of two subunits - 50S and 30S units which when present together form 70S prokaryotic ribosomes. Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may attach to a single mRNA and form a chain called polyribosomes or polysome. The ribosomes of a polysome translate the mRNA into proteins. Inclusion bodies: Reserve material in prokaryotic cells are stored in the cytoplasm in the form of inclusion bodies. These are not bound by any membrane system and lie free in the cytoplasm, e.g., phosphate granules, cyanophycean granules and glycogen granules. Gas vacuoles are found in blue green and purple and green photosynthetic bacteria.

 8.4.1 Cell Envelope and its Modifications Most prokaryotic cells, particularly the bacterial cells, have a chemically complex cell envelope. The cell envelope consists of a tightly bound three layered structure i.e., the outermost glycocalyx followed by the cell wall and then the plasma membrane. Although each layer of the envelope performs distinct function, they act together as a single protective unit. Bacteria can be classified into two groups on the basis of the differences in the cell envelopes and the manner in which they respond to the staining procedure developed by Gram viz., those that take up the gram stain are Gram positive and the others that do not are called Gram negative bacteria. Glycocalyx differs in composition and thickness among different bacteria. It could be a loose sheath called the slime layer in some, while in others it may be thick and tough, called the capsule. The cell wall determines the shape of the cell and provides a strong structural support to prevent the bacterium from bursting or collapsing. The plasma membrane is selectively permeable in nature and interacts with the outside world. This membrane is similar structurally to that of the eukaryotes. A special membranous structure is the mesosome which is formed by the extensions of plasma membrane into the cell. These extensions are in the form of vesicles, tubules and lamellae. They help in cell wall

Differentiate between exocytosis and endocytosis.,"S. No.  Exocytosis  Endocytosis  (i)  Expulsion of materials from the cell takes place.  In it, cellular active intake of materials takes place.  (ii) (iii)  It destroys vesicles. Primary function of exocytosis is expelling waste.  It creates vesicles. Primary function of endocytosis is getting nutrients. ","If this energy is to be useful to the cell, it should be able to utilise it to synthesise other molecules that the cell requires. The strategy that the plant cell uses is to catabolise the glucose molecule in such a way that not all the liberated energy goes out as heat. The key is to oxidise glucose not in one step but in several small steps enabling some steps to be just large enough such that the energy released can be coupled to ATP synthesis. How this is done is, essentially, the story of respiration. During the process of respiration, oxygen is utilised, and carbon dioxide, water and energy are released as products. The combustion reaction requires oxygen. But some cells live where oxygen may or may not be available. Can you think of such situations (and organisms) where O2 is not available? There are sufficient reasons to believe that the first cells on this planet lived in an atmosphere that lacked oxygen. Even among present-day living organisms, we know of several that are adapted to anaerobic conditions. Some of these organisms are facultative anaerobes, while in others the requirement for anaerobic condition is obligate. In any case, all living organisms retain the enzymatic machinery to partially oxidise glucose without the help of oxygen. This breakdown of glucose to pyruvic acid is called glycolysis.
 synthesise a larger number of ATP molecules needed for cellular metabolism? In eukaryotes these steps take place within the mitochondria and this requires O2. Aerobic respiration is the process that leads to a complete oxidation of organic substances in the presence of oxygen, and releases CO2, water and a large amount of energy present in the substrate. This type of respiration is most common in higher organisms. We will look at these processes in the next section.
 14.4 AEROBIC RESPIRATION For aerobic respiration to take place within the mitochondria, the final product of glycolysis, pyruvate is transported from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria. The crucial events in aerobic respiration are:

Majority of the chloroplasts of the green plants are found in the mesophyll cells of the leaves. These are lens-shaped, oval, spherical, discoid or even ribbon-like organelles having variable length (5-10µm) and width (2-4µm). Their number varies from 1 per cell of the Chlamydomonas, a green alga to 20-40 per cell in the mesophyll. Like mitochondria, the chloroplasts are also double membrane bound. Of the two, Figure 8.8 Sectional view of chloroplast the inner chloroplast membrane is relatively less permeable. The space limited by the inner membrane of the chloroplast is called the stroma. A number of organised flattened membranous sacs called the thylakoids, are present in the stroma (Figure 8.8). Thylakoids are arranged in stacks like the piles of coins called grana (singular: granum) or the intergranal thylakoids. In addition, there are flat membranous tubules called the stroma lamellae connecting the thylakoids of the different grana. The membrane of the thylakoids enclose a space called a lumen. The stroma of the chloroplast contains enzymes required for the synthesis of carbohydrates and proteins. It also contains small, doublestranded circular DNA molecules and ribosomes. Chlorophyll pigments are present in the thylakoids. The ribosomes of the chloroplasts are smaller (70S) than the cytoplasmic ribosomes (80S).

The cis and the trans faces of the organelle are entirely different, but interconnected. The golgi apparatus principally performs the function of packaging materials, to be delivered either to the intra-cellular targets or secreted outside the cell. Materials to be packaged in the form of vesicles from the ER fuse with the cis face of the golgi apparatus and move towards the maturing face. This explains, why the golgi apparatus remains in close association with the endoplasmic reticulum. A number of proteins synthesised by ribosomes on the endoplasmic reticulum are modified in the cisternae of the golgi apparatus before they are released from its trans face. Golgi apparatus is the important site of formation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. 8.5.3.3 Lysosomes These are membrane bound vesicular structures formed by the process of packaging in the golgi apparatus. The isolated lysosomal vesicles have been found to be very rich in almost all types of hydrolytic enzymes (hydrolases – lipases, proteases, carbohydrases) optimally active at the acidic pH. These enzymes are capable of digesting carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. 8.5.3.4 Vacuoles The vacuole is the membrane-bound space found in the cytoplasm. It contains water, sap, excretory product and other materials not useful for the cell. The vacuole is bound by a single membrane called tonoplast. In plant cells the vacuoles can occupy up to 90 per cent of the volume of the cell. In plants, the tonoplast facilitates the transport of a number of ions and other materials against concentration gradients into the vacuole, hence their concentration is significantly higher in the vacuole than in the cytoplasm. In Amoeba the contractile vacuole is important for osmoregulation and excretion. In many cells, as in protists, food vacuoles are formed by engulfing the food particles.

","formation, DNA replication and distribution to daughter cells. They also help in respiration, secretion processes, to increase the surface area of the plasma membrane and enzymatic content. In some prokaryotes like cyanobacteria, there are other membranous extensions into the cytoplasm called chromatophores which contain pigments. Bacterial cells may be motile or non-motile. If motile, they have thin filamentous extensions from their cell wall called flagella. Bacteria show a range in the number and arrangement of flagella. Bacterial flagellum is composed of three parts – filament, hook and basal body. The filament is the longest portion and extends from the cell surface to the outside. Besides flagella, Pili and Fimbriae are also surface structures of the bacteria but do not play a role in motility. The pili are elongated tubular structures made of a special protein. The fimbriae are small bristle like fibres sprouting out of the cell. In some bacteria, they are known to help attach the bacteria to rocks in streams and also to the host tissues.
 8.5.8 Cilia and Flagella Cilia (sing.: cilium) and flagella (sing.: flagellum) are hair-like outgrowths of the cell membrane. Cilia are small structures which work like oars, causing the movement of either the cell or the surrounding fluid. Flagella are comparatively longer and responsible for cell movement. The prokaryotic bacteria also possess flagella but these are structurally different from that of the eukaryotic flagella. The electron microscopic study of a cilium or the flagellum show that they are covered with plasma membrane. Their core called the axoneme, possesses a number of microtubules running parallel to the long axis. The axoneme usually has nine doublets of radially arranged peripheral microtubules, and a pair of centrally located microtubules. Such an arrangement of axonemal microtubules is referred to as the 9+2 array (Figure 8.10). The central tubules are connected by bridges and is also enclosed by a central sheath, which is connected to one of the tubules of each peripheral doublets by a radial spoke. Thus, there are nine radial spokes. The peripheral doublets are also interconnected by linkers. Both the cilium and flagellum emerge from centriole-like structure called the basal bodies.

What is endocytosis? How many types of endocytosis are there?,"Endocytosis is the process of active cellular intake of materials.

Pigments are always present. ATP is formed in the presence sunlight by thylakoids. Thylakoids are present.  ","13.6.3 Chemiosmotic Hypothesis Let us now try and understand how actually ATP is synthesised in the chloroplast. The chemiosmotic hypothesis has been put forward to explain the mechanism. Like in respiration, in photosynthesis too, ATP synthesis is linked to development of a proton gradient across a membrane. This time these are the membranes of thylakoid. There is one difference though, here the proton accumulation is towards the inside of the membrane, i.e., in the lumen. In respiration, protons accumulate in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria when electrons move through the ETS (Chapter 14). Let us understand what causes the proton gradient across the membrane. We need to consider again the processes that take place during the activation of electrons and their transport to determine the steps that cause a proton gradient to develop (Figure 13.7). (a) Since splitting of the water molecule takes place on the inner side of the membrane, the protons or hydrogen ions that are produced by the splitting of water accumulate within the lumen of the thylakoids.

 8.5.8 Cilia and Flagella Cilia (sing.: cilium) and flagella (sing.: flagellum) are hair-like outgrowths of the cell membrane. Cilia are small structures which work like oars, causing the movement of either the cell or the surrounding fluid. Flagella are comparatively longer and responsible for cell movement. The prokaryotic bacteria also possess flagella but these are structurally different from that of the eukaryotic flagella. The electron microscopic study of a cilium or the flagellum show that they are covered with plasma membrane. Their core called the axoneme, possesses a number of microtubules running parallel to the long axis. The axoneme usually has nine doublets of radially arranged peripheral microtubules, and a pair of centrally located microtubules. Such an arrangement of axonemal microtubules is referred to as the 9+2 array (Figure 8.10). The central tubules are connected by bridges and is also enclosed by a central sheath, which is connected to one of the tubules of each peripheral doublets by a radial spoke. Thus, there are nine radial spokes. The peripheral doublets are also interconnected by linkers. Both the cilium and flagellum emerge from centriole-like structure called the basal bodies.

Write any four functions of cell wall.,(i) It provides definite shape to cell and protects protoplasm. (ii) It gives rigidity and support to the tissues of the plant. (iii) It counter acts osmotic pressure and prevents bursting of plant cells due to endosmosis. (iv) It takes part in offence and defence.,"8.5.2 Cell Wall As you may recall, a non-living rigid structure called the cell wall forms an outer covering for the plasma membrane of fungi and plants. Cell wall not only gives shape to the cell and protects the cell from mechanical damage and infection, it also helps in cell-to-cell interaction and provides barrier to undesirable macromolecules. Algae have cell wall, made of cellulose, galactans, mannans and minerals like calcium carbonate, while in other plants it consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and proteins. The cell wall of a young plant cell, the primary wall is capable of growth, which gradually diminishes as the cell matures and the secondary wall is formed on the inner (towards membrane) side of the cell. The middle lamella is a layer mainly of calcium pectate which holds or glues the different neighbouring cells together. The cell wall and middle lamellae may be traversed by plasmodesmata which connect the cytoplasm of neighbouring cells.

 8.5.3.1 The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Electron microscopic studies of eukaryotic cells reveal the presence of a network or reticulum of tiny tubular structures scattered in the cytoplasm that is called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 8.5). Hence, ER divides the intracellular space into two distinct compartments, i.e., luminal (inside ER) and extra luminal (cytoplasm) compartments. The ER often shows ribosomes attached to their outer surface. The endoplasmic reticulun bearing ribosomes on their surface is called rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). In the absence of ribosomes they appear smooth and are called smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). RER is frequently observed in the cells actively involved in protein synthesis and secretion. They are extensive and continuous with the outer membrane of the nucleus. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the major site for synthesis of lipid. In animal cells lipid-like steroidal hormones are synthesised in SER.

Explain the structure and the function of plasmodesmata.,Plasmodesmata are cytoplasmic bridges between adjacent plant cells which develop in the minute pores of cell walls.

List the main function of chloroplast.,(i) Chloroplast are the centres of photosynthesis. (ii) They liberate oxygen which is passed into the atmosphere. (iii) These store fats in the form of plastoglobuli. (iv) These help in maintaining the balance of gases in the atmosphere. (v) They can change into the chromoplasts to provide colour to many flowers and fruits.,"You would of course answer: in ‘the green leaf’ or ‘in the chloroplasts’, based on what you earlier read in Chapter 8. You are definitely right. Photosynthesis does take place in the green leaves of plants but it does so also in other green parts of the plants. Can you name some other parts where you think photosynthesis may occur? You would recollect from previous unit that the mesophyll cells in the leaves, have a large number of chloroplasts. Usually the chloroplasts align themselves along the walls of the mesophyll cells, such that they get the optimum quantity of the incident light. When do you think the chloroplasts will be aligned with their flat surfaces parallel to the walls? When would they be perpendicular to the incident light? You have studied the structure of chloroplast in Chapter 8. Within the chloroplast there is membranous system consisting of grana, the stroma lamellae, and the matrix stroma (Figure 13.2). There is a clear division of labour within the chloroplast. The membrane system is responsible for trapping the light energy and also for the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. In stroma, enzymatic reactions synthesise sugar, which in turn forms starch. The former set of reactions, since they are directly light driven are called light reactions (photochemical reactions). The latter are not directly light driven but are dependent on the products of light reactions (ATP and NADPH). Hence, to distinguish the latter they are called, by convention, as dark reactions (carbon reactions). However, this should not be construed to mean that they occur in darkness or that they are not light-dependent. Outer membrane Inner membrane Stromal lamella Grana

How do peroxisomes perform photorespiration ?,Peroxisomes perform photorespiration as they pick up glycolate from chloroplasts. The same is oxidised with the help of oxygen to produce glyoxylate. The later is changed to amino acid glycine and then to serine and CO 2 in mitochondria.,"We learnt that the products of light reaction are ATP, NADPH and O2. Of these O2 diffuses out of the chloroplast while ATP and NADPH are used to drive the processes leading to the synthesis of food, more accurately, sugars. This is the biosynthetic phase of photosynthesis. This process does not directly depend on the presence of light but is dependent on the products of the light reaction, i.e., ATP and NADPH, besides CO2 and H2O. You may wonder how this could be verified; it is simple: immediately after light becomes unavailable, the biosynthetic process continues for some time, and then stops. If then, light is made available, the synthesis starts again. Can we, hence, say that calling the biosynthetic phase as the dark reaction is a misnomer? Discuss this amongst yourselves. Let us now see how the ATP and NADPH are used in the biosynthetic phase. We saw earlier that CO2 is combined with H2O to produce (CH2O)n or sugars. It was of interest to scientists to find out how this reaction proceeded, or rather what was the first product formed when CO2 is taken into a reaction or fixed. Just after world war II, among the several efforts to put radioisotopes to beneficial use, the work of Melvin Calvin is exemplary. The use of radioactive 14C by him in algal photosynthesis studies led to the discovery that the first CO2 fixation product was a 3-carbon organic acid. He also contributed to working out the complete biosynthetic pathway; hence it was called Calvin cycle after him. The first product identified was 3-phosphoglyceric acid or in short PGA. How many carbon atoms does it have?

(ii) They take part is storage and synthesis of fats and present abundantly in endosperm of oil seeds.  ,"SUMMARY All organisms are made of cells or aggregates of cells. Cells vary in their shape, size and activities/functions. Based on the presence or absence of a membrane bound nucleus and other organelles, cells and hence organisms can be named as eukaryotic or prokaryotic. A typical eukaryotic cell consists of a cell membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm. Plant cells have a cell wall outside the cell membrane. The plasma membrane is selectively permeable and facilitates transport of several molecules. The endomembrane system includes ER, golgi complex, lysosomes and vacuoles. All the cell organelles perform different but specific functions. Centrosome and centriole form the basal body of cilia and flagella that facilitate locomotion. In animal cells, centrioles also form spindle apparatus during cell division. Nucleus contains nucleoli and chromatin network. It not only controls the activities of organelles but also plays a major role in heredity. Endoplasmic reticulum contains tubules or cisternae. They are of two types: rough and smooth. ER helps in the transport of substances, synthesis of proteins, lipoproteins and glycogen. The golgi body is a membranous organelle composed of flattened sacs. The secretions of cells are packed in them and transported from the cell. L ysosomes are single membrane structures containing enzymes for digestion of all types of macromolecules. Ribosomes are involved in protein synthesis. These occur freely in the cytoplasm or are associated with ER. Mitochondria help in oxidative phosphorylation and generation of adenosine triphosphate. They are bound by double membrane; the outer membrane is smooth and inner one folds into several cristae. Plastids are pigment containing organelles found in plant cells only. In plant cells, chloroplasts are responsible for trapping light energy essential for photosynthesis. The grana, in the plastid, is the site of light reactions and the stroma of dark reactions. The green coloured plastids are chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll, whereas the other coloured plastids are chromoplasts, which may contain pigments like carotene and xanthophyll. The nucleus is enclosed by nuclear envelope, a double membrane structure with nuclear pores. The inner membrane encloses the nucleoplasm and the chromatin material. Thus, cell is the structural and functional unit of life.

Which symmetry is most common in animals? Define it.?   ,"Bilateral symmetry. In bilateral type of symmetry, the body can be divided into two equal halves by a single plane only because the important body organs are paired and occur on the two sides of a central axis.","Symmetry
 Animals can be categorised on the basis of their symmetry. Sponges are mostly asymmetrical, i.e., any plane that passes through the centre does not divide them into equal halves. When any plane passing through the central axis of the body divides the organism into two identical halves, it is called radial symmetry. Coelenterates, ctenophores and echinoderms have this kind of body plan (Figure 4.1a). Animals like annelids, arthropods, etc., where the body can be divided into identical left and right halves in only one plane, exhibit bilateral symmetry (Figure 4.1b).

Define germinal layers.,"(i) Germinal or germ layers are primary layers of cell which differentiate in developing embryo and from which various tissues and organs of the animal body develop. (ii) A maximum of three germinal layers are found in embryo. They are ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. Out of these, mesoderm is the last to develop in between ectoderm and endoderm.","Those animals in which the developing embryo has a third germinal layer, mesoderm, in between the ectoderm and endoderm, are called triploblastic animals (platyhelminthes to chordates, Figure 4.2b).
 "
What is metamerism ? Differentiate between metameric and non metameric segmentation ? ,"Segmentation of external and internal body into linear sequence of segments (repetition of atleast some organ) is called metamerism. Metameric Segmentation: External segmentation correspond to internal segmentation, e.g., Earthworm. Non-metameric Segmentation : External segmentation do not correspond internal segmentation, e.g. Platyhelminthes.","Presence or absence of a cavity between the body wall and the gut wall is very important in classification. The body cavity, which is lined by mesoderm is called coelom. Animals possessing coelom are called coelomates, e.g., annelids, molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates (Figure 4.3a). In some animals, the body cavity is not lined by mesoderm, instead, the mesoderm is present as scattered pouches in between the ectoderm and endoderm. Such a body cavity is called pseudocoelom and the animals possessing them are called pseudocoelomates, e.g., aschelminthes (Figure 4.3b). The animals in which the body cavity is absent are called acoelomates, e.g., platyhelminthes (Figure 4.3c).
 Segmentation
 Segmentation
 In some animals, the body is externally and internally divided into segments with a serial repetition of at least some organs. For example, in earthworm, the body shows this pattern called metameric segmentation and the phenomenon is known as metamerism.

(iv) Cephalothorax : Head and thorax fuse to form cephalothorax in some arthropods. It bears antennae, antennules, eyes, maxillipeds and legs.","A survey of animal kingdom presents a variety of excretory structures. In most of the invertebrates, these structures are simple tubular forms whereas vertebrates have complex tubular organs called kidneys. Some of these structures are mentioned here. Protonephridia or flame cells are the excretory structures in Platyhelminthes (Flatworms, e.g., Planaria), rotifers, some annelids and the cephalochordate – Amphioxus. Protonephridia are primarily concerned with ionic and fluid volume regulation, i.e., osmoregulation. Nephridia are the tubular excretory structures of earthworms and other annelids. Nephridia help to remove nitrogenous wastes and maintain a fluid and ionic balance. Malpighian tubules are the excretory structures of most of the insects including cockroaches. Malpighian tubules help in the removal of nitrogenous wastes and osmoregulation. Antennal glands or green glands perform the excretory function in crustaceans like prawns.

 "
which features make reptiles successful on land ?,"Four features that make reptiles true land animals are : (i) The amnion (embryonic membrane) encloses the embryo and provides it with a watery environment during development, therefore, the embryo does not need watery environment.  (ii) Internal fertilization. (iii) Shell around the egg to check desiccation. (iv) Horny scales on the body of reptiles check loss of water.","As the name indicates (Gr., Amphi : dual, bios, life), amphibians can live in aquatic as well as terrestrial habitats (Figure 4.21). Most of them have two pairs of limbs. Body is divisible into head and trunk. Tail may be present in some. The amphibian skin is moist (without scales). The eyes have eyelids. A tympanum represents the ear. Alimentary canal, urinary and reproductive tracts open into a common chamber called cloaca which opens to the exterior. Respiration is by gills, lungs and through skin. The heart is threechambered (two auricles and one ventricle). These are cold-blooded animals. Sexes are separate. Fertilisation is external. They are oviparous and development is indirect. Examples: Bufo (Toad), Rana (Frog), Hyla (Tree frog), Salamandra (Salamander), Ichthyophis (Limbless amphibia).
 Have you ever touched the skin of frog? The skin is smooth and slippery due to the presence of mucus. The skin is always maintained in a moist condition. The colour of dorsal side of body is generally olive green with dark irregular spots. On the ventral side the skin is uniformly pale yellow. The frog never drinks water but absorb it through the skin. Body of a frog is divisible into head and trunk (Figure 7.19). A neck and tail are absent. Above the mouth, a pair of nostrils is present. Eyes are bulged and covered by a nictitating membrane that protects them while in water. On either side of eyes a membranous Head tympanum (ear) receives sound signals. The forelimbs and hind limbs help in swimming, Eye walking, leaping and burrowing. The hind limbs end in five digits and they are larger and muscular than fore limbs that end in four digits. Feet have webbed digits that help in swimming. Frogs exhibit sexual dimorphism. Male frogs can be distinguished by the Fore limb presence of sound producing vocal sacs and also a copulatory pad on the first digit of the fore limbs Hind limb which are absent in female frogs.

Give the levels of organisation in animals.,The animals differ greatly in their shape and size. Their body shows different levels of organisation and body plan. (i) Protoplasmic Level – e.g. protozoans (ii) Cellular Level - e.g. sponges (iii) Tissue Level - e-g. coelenterates (iv) Organ system Level – e.g. all metazoans.,"Though all members of Animalia are multicellular, all of them do not exhibit the same pattern of organisation of cells. For example, in sponges, the cells are arranged as loose cell aggregates, i.e., they exhibit cellular level of organisation. Some division of labour (activities) occur among the cells. In coelenterates, the arrangement of cells is more complex. Here the cells performing the same function are arranged into tissues, hence is called tissue level of organisation. A still higher level of organisation, i.e., organ level is exhibited by members of Platyhelminthes and other higher phyla where tissues are grouped together to form organs, each specialised for a particular function. In animals like Annelids, Arthropods, Molluscs,

What are the unique features of Cnidarians?,The Cnidarians have: (i) Tissue level of organization. (ii) Incomplete digestive tract surrounded by body wall. (iii) Cnidoblasts for defence and offence. (iv) Gonads without gonadoducts. (v) Epitheliomuscular cells. (vi) Network of nerve cells acting as nervous system.  (Any four) ,"cnidoblasts or cnidocytes (which contain the stinging capsules or nematocysts) present on the tentacles and the body. Cnidoblasts are used for anchorage, defense and for the capture of prey (Figure 4.7). Cnidarians exhibit tissue level of organisation and are diploblastic. They have a central gastro-vascular cavity with a single opening, mouth on hypostome. Digestion is extracellular and intracellular. Some of the cnidarians, e.g., corals have a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate. Cnidarians exhibit two basic body forms called polyp and medusa (Figure 4.6). The former is a sessile and cylindrical form like Hydra, Adamsia, etc. whereas, the latter is umbrella-shaped and free-swimming like Aurelia or jelly fish. Those cnidarians which exist in both forms exhibit alternation of generation (Metagenesis), i.e., polyps produce medusae asexually and medusae form the polyps sexually (e.g., Obelia). Examples: Physalia (Portuguese man-of-war), Adamsia (Sea anemone), Pennatula (Sea-pen), Gorgonia (Sea-fan) and Meandrina (Brain coral).

Write about sexual dimorphism in Aschelminthes.,Nemathelminthes have distinct sexual dimorphism the female is larger than the male. The tail of male is coiled like tendril and has a pair of unequal copulatory spicules. Female has an anus while male bears cloacal aperture.,"The body of the aschelminthes is circular in cross-section, hence, the name roundworms (Figure 4.10). They may be freeliving, aquatic and terrestrial or parasitic in plants and animals. Roundworms have organ-system level of body organisation. They are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and pseudocoelomate animals. Alimentary canal is complete with a welldeveloped muscular pharynx. An excretory tube removes body wastes from the body cavity through the excretory pore. Sexes are separate (dioecious), i.e., males and females are distinct. Often females are longer than males. Fertilisation is internal and development may be direct (the young ones resemble the adult) or indirect.
 "
Distinguish between the following by giving one main point: Coelenteron and spongocoel.,"S.No. (i)  (ii)  Coelenterons In Cnidarians, the body enclose coelen- teron cavity, hence the name coelen- terata is given to this phylum. Coelenterons has only one aperture mouth.Anus is absent. Coelenteron is lined by gastrodermis. E.g., Hydra, Aurelia, Physalia, Adamsia, Pennatula etc.  Spongocoel In sponges, the body wall encloses a large cavity called spongo-coel.  Spongocoel is lined by flagellated choanocytes. Water current enter through dermal ostia (pores) and after passing through spongocoel, water goes out by osculum. E.g., sponges like Scypha, Euplectella, Leucosolenia. ","Presence or absence of a cavity between the body wall and the gut wall is very important in classification. The body cavity, which is lined by mesoderm is called coelom. Animals possessing coelom are called coelomates, e.g., annelids, molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates (Figure 4.3a). In some animals, the body cavity is not lined by mesoderm, instead, the mesoderm is present as scattered pouches in between the ectoderm and endoderm. Such a body cavity is called pseudocoelom and the animals possessing them are called pseudocoelomates, e.g., aschelminthes (Figure 4.3b). The animals in which the body cavity is absent are called acoelomates, e.g., platyhelminthes (Figure 4.3c).
 "
What are the unique features of sponges? ,"The sponges have pores all over the body, cellular level of organisation, a canal system for the passage of water current, choanocytes lining the main cavity (spongocoel) or certain  canal (radial canal), skeleton made up of spicules and spongin fibres and absence of mouth and digestive cavity.","4.2.1 Phylum – Porifera Members of this phylum are commonly known as sponges. They are generally marine and mostly asymmetrical animals (Figure 4.5). These are primitive multicellular animals and have cellular level of organisation. Sponges have a water transport or canal system. Water enters through minute pores (ostia) in the body wall into a central cavity, spongocoel, from where it goes out through the osculum. This pathway of water transport is helpful in food gathering, respiratory exchange and removal of waste. Choanocytes (a) or collar cells line the spongocoel and the canals. Digestion is intracellular. The body is supported by a skeleton made up of spicules or spongin fibres. Sexes are not separate (hermaphrodite), i.e., eggs and sperms are produced by the same individual. Sponges reproduce asexually by fragmentation and sexually by formation of gametes. Fertilisation is internal and development is indirect having a larval stage which is Figure 4.5 morphologically distinct from the adult.

 "
How annelids have receptors to sense the environment?,"(i) Annelids have several receptors to sense light. Light receptors occurs in clusters in polychaetes and leeches to sense light. (ii) In earthworms, they are diffused, which can differentiate only between darkness and light. (iii) Chemical and taste receptors are found in the fleshy lobe called prostomium. (iv/) Touch receptors are found all over the body.","Sensory system does not have eyes but does possess light and touch sensitive organs (receptor cells) to distinguish the light intensities and to feel the vibrations in the ground. Worms have specialised chemoreceptors (taste receptors) which react to chemical stimuli. These sense organs are located on the anterior part of the worm. Earthworm is hermaphrodite (bisexual), i.e., testes and ovaries are present in the same individual (Figure 7.13). There are two pairs of testes present in the 10th and 11th segments. Their vasa deferentia run up to the 18th segment where they join the prostatic duct. Two pairs of accessory glands are present one pair each in the 17th and 19th segments. The common prostate and spermatic duct (vasa deferentia) opens to the exterior by a pair of male genital pores on the ventro-lateral side of the 18th segment. Four pairs of spermathecae are located in 6th-9th segments (one pair in each segment). They receive and store spermatozoa during copulation. One pair of ovaries is attached at the inter-segmental septum of the 12th and 13th segments. Ovarian funnels are present beneath the ovaries which continue into oviduct, join together and open on the ventral side as a single median female genital pore on the 14th segment. A mutual exchange of sperm occurs between two worms during mating. One worm has to find another worm and they mate juxtaposing opposite gonadal openings exchanging packets of sperms called spermatophores. Mature sperm and egg cells and nutritive fluid are deposited in cocoons produced by the gland cells of clitellum. Fertilisation and development occur within the Figure 7.13 Reproductive system of earthworm cocoons which are deposited in soil. The ova (eggs) are fertilised by the sperm cells within the cocoon which then slips off the worm and is deposited in or on the soil. The cocoon holds the worm embryos. After about 3 weeks, each cocoon produces two to twenty baby worms with an average of four. Development of earthworms is direct, i.e., there is no larva formed.

What do you understand by metameric segmentation?,"Metameric segmentation is also known as true segmentation. It is a type of segmentation where external divisions corresponds to internal divisions. (i) The body is often divided both externally and internally into a number of segments. e.g., annelids. (ii) Segmentation is mostly external in arthropods and mainly internal in man (vertebrae, body muscles, blood vessels, nerves). ","Segmentation
 In some animals, the body is externally and internally divided into segments with a serial repetition of at least some organs. For example, in earthworm, the body shows this pattern called metameric segmentation and the phenomenon is known as metamerism.

Why does it become difficult to breathe at high altitudes ?,"At high altitudes, the concentration of oxygen becomes less. At a height of about 15,000 feet or more, the pressure also decreases along with a decrease in the oxygen  content. Persons reaching such heights are unable to get the amount of oxygen required for proper functioning of their body. Due to this, sufficient oxygen does not diffuse into the blood, as a result of which the person suffers from nausea, headache and delusion. As a result he finds it difficult to breathe.","Breathing involves two stages : inspiration during which atmospheric air is drawn in and expiration by which the alveolar air is released out. The movement of air into and out of the lungs is carried out by creating a pressure gradient between the lungs and the atmosphere. Inspiration can occur if the pressure within the lungs (intra-pulmonary pressure) is less than the atmospheric pressure, i.e., there is a negative pressure in the lungs with respect to atmospheric pressure. Similarly, expiration takes place when the intra-pulmonary pressure is higher than the atmospheric pressure. The diaphragm and a specialised set of muscles – external and internal intercostals between the ribs, help in generation of such gradients. Inspiration is initiated by the contraction of diaphragm which increases the volume of thoracic chamber in the antero-posterior axis. The contraction of external inter-costal muscles lifts up the ribs and the
 "
Why do you breathe faster while running ?,"The metabolism of food increases due to the supply of more energy to the body, while running. Due to this process more carbon dioxide is added into the blood and its concentration in the blood is increased above normal, which stimulates the respiratory centre in the brain. The respiratory centre sends the stimulus to the muscles of ribs and diaphragm through the nerves for faster and deeper respiration. Thus we breathe faster during running or hard physical work.","BREATHING

 Human beings have a significant ability to maintain and moderate the respiratory rhythm to suit the demands of the body tissues. This is done by the neural system. A specialised centre present in the medulla region of the brain called respiratory rhythm centre is primarily responsible for this regulation. Another centre present in the pons region of the brain called pneumotaxic centre can moderate the functions of the respiratory rhythm centre. Neural signal from this centre can reduce the duration of inspiration and thereby alter the respiratory rate. A chemosensitive area is situated adjacent to the rhythm centre which is highly sensitive to CO2 and hydrogen ions. Increase in these substances can activate this centre, which in turn can signal the rhythm centre to make necessary adjustments in the respiratory process by which these substances can be eliminated. Receptors associated with aortic arch and carotid artery also can recognise changes in CO2 and H+ concentration and send necessary signals to the rhythm centre for remedial actions. The role of oxygen in the regulation of respiratory rhythm is quite insignificant.

How is oxygen transported in the blood and released in the tissues ? 2009]  [NCT- ,"(i) Blood carries oxygen from the lungs to the heart and from the heart to various body parts. (ii) About 3 % of oxygen in the blood is dissolved in the plasma which carries oxygen to the body cells. (iii) About 97% of oxygen is carried in combination with haemoglobin of the erythrocytes. (iv) The haem portion of haemoglobin contains four atoms of iron, each capable of combining with a molecule of oxygen. (v) Oxygen and haemoglobin combine in an easily reversible reaction to form oxyhaemoglobin (HbO 2).  (vi) Under the high partial pressure, oxygen easily binds with haemoglobin in the pulmonary (lung) blood capillaries. (vii) When this oxygenated blood reaches the different tissues, the partial pressure of oxygen declines and the bonds holding oxygen to haemoglobin become unstable.

When pCO2 is high and pO2 is low as in the tissues, more binding of carbon dioxide occurs whereas, when the pCO2 is low and pO2 is high as in the alveoli, dissociation

"What is the role of carbonic anhydrase ? Show by a series of reactions, how carbonic anhydrase starts the reaction leading to the formation of haemoglobinic acid (Н.НЬ) ? How is CO 2 transported from tissues to the lungs in human beings ? ",Carbonic Anhydrase : (i) CO 2 reacts with water in presence of carbonic anhydrase in erythrocytes. (ii) Carbonic acid (H2CO3) is dissociated into hydrogen (H+) and bicarbonate (HCO 3) ions. (iii) Oxyhaemoglobin (HbO 2) of RBCs is weakly acidic and remain in association with K + ions as KHbO2. H+ ions combine with haemoglobin. (iv) Bicarbonate ions diffuse out into plasma and combine with haemoglobin to form haemoglobinic acid (H.Hb). ,"of CO2 from carbamino-haemoglobin takes place, i.e., CO2 which is bound to haemoglobin from the tissues is delivered at the alveoli. RBCs contain a very high concentration of the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase and minute quantities of the same is present in the plasma too. This enzyme facilitates the following reaction in both directions. Carbonic anhydrase

 At the tissue site where partial pressure of CO2 is high due to catabolism, CO2 diffuses into blood (RBCs and plasma) and forms HCO3– and H+,. At the alveolar site where pCO2 is low, the reaction proceeds in the opposite direction leading to the formation of CO2 and H2O. Thus, CO2 trapped as bicarbonate at the tissue level and transported to the alveoli is released out as CO2 (Figure 17.4). Every 100 ml of deoxygenated blood delivers approximately 4 ml of CO2 to the alveoli.

How does exchange of respiratory gases takes place in the alveoli of lungs ? ,(i) During uptake of air the partial pressure of oxygen and pCO 2 are 159 mm Hg and 0.3 mm Hg respectively. (ii) There is already small amount of alveolar air in the lungs. This air contains less amount of O2 and more CO 2 than the inspired air. (iii) As this alveolar air mixes with the inspired air then O 2 counted and pO 2 of alveolar air increases to 13.1% and 100 mm Hg whereas CO 2 content and pCO 2 is 5.3% and 40 mm Hg. (iv) The pulmonary artery brings the deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs. (v) The blood consist of lower pO 2 than alveolar pO 2. (vi) In the lungs O2 diffuses into the blood from the alveolar air and pO2 which is 95 mm Hg increases by 19.8%. (vii) This oxygenated blood is taken away by the pulmonary vein. (viii) This blood in alveolar capillaries contains pCO 2 which falls to 40 mm Hg. (ix) In the alveoli of the lungs O 2 is taken up by vein and CO 2 is given out from blood through artery. ,"At the tissue site where partial pressure of CO2 is high due to catabolism, CO2 diffuses into blood (RBCs and plasma) and forms HCO3– and H+,.

How does gaseous exchange takes place in tissues ?,"(i) Gaseous exchange initially takes place between the alveoli of lungs and blood capillaries and finally between blood capillaries and tissues by a physical process called diffusion. (ii) The oxygenated blood from the lungs is carried to the heart for distribution to individual body cells. (iii) The blood reaching the tissue capillaries has pO2 of 95 mm Hg and pCO 2 of 40 mm Hg while the cells has pO 2 of 20 and pCO 2 of 52 mm Hg. (iv) Because of differences in partial pressures of blood and tissue cells, oxygen diffuses from the blood into the cells, and carbon dioxide from the cells into the blood through tissue fluid which acts as middle man. (v) The final diffusion of gases in the tissues lowers the pO 2 of the blood and raises its pCO 2. (vi) This process is called internal respiration or tissue respiration.","17.3 E XCHANGE OF GASES Alveoli are the primary sites of exchange of gases. Exchange of gases also occur between blood and tissues. O2 and CO2 are exchanged in these sites by simple diffusion mainly based on pressure/concentration gradient. Solubility of the gases as well as the thickness of the membranes involved in diffusion are also some important factors that can affect the rate of diffusion. Pressure contributed by an individual gas in a mixture of gases is called partial pressure and is represented as pO2 for oxygen and pCO2 for carbon dioxide. Partial pressures of these two gases in the atmospheric air and the two sites of diffusion are given in Table 17.1 and in Figure 17.3. The data given in the table clearly indicates a concentration gradient for oxygen from alveoli to blood and blood to tissues. Similarly,

(i) For glucose, R.Q. is 1 (ii) For fats it is about 0.7, (iii) For proteins it is about 0.9 and for organic acids it is about 1.3 or 1.4.","14.7 RESPIRATORY QUOTIENT Let us now look at another aspect of respiration. As you know, during aerobic respiration, O2 is consumed and CO2 is released. The ratio of the volume of CO2 evolved to the volume of O2 consumed in respiration is called the respiratory quotient (RQ) or respiratory ratio. RQ =
 volume of CO2 evolved volume of O2 consumed
 The respiratory quotient depends upon the type of respiratory substrate used during respiration. When carbohydrates are used as substrate and are completely oxidised, the RQ will be 1, because equal amounts of CO2 and O2 are evolved and consumed, respectively, as shown in the equation below :

Describe the role of red blood cells in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide by blood.,"Role of red blood cells in the transport of oxygen: (i) Red blood cells are known as erythrocytes. They carry oxygen in the form of an unstable, easily dissociable chemical combination with haemoglobin. (ii) O 2 diffuse into RBCs and combines usually with haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin.  (iii) In tissues oxyhaemoglobin dissociates into oxygen and deoxyhemoglobin at low partial pressure. (iv) The blood carries its full load to O 2 until it enters the capillaries in tissues to the lungs.  Role of red blood cells in the transport of CO 2 : (i) Carbon dioxide is carried by RBCs. About 30% of CO2 is carried by RBC's from tissues to the lungs. (ii) CO 2 on entering the red blood cell loosely combines with the amino group of reduced Hb and forms carbaminohemoglobin. ","Blood is the medium of transport for O2 and CO2. About 97 per cent of O2 is transported by RBCs in the blood. The remaining 3 per cent of O2 is carried in a dissolved state through the plasma. Nearly 20-25 per cent of CO2 is transported by RBCs whereas 70 per cent of it is carried as bicarbonate. About 7 per cent of CO2 is carried in a dissolved state through plasma.
 Percentage saturation of haemoglobin with oxygen
 17.4.1 Transport of Oxygen Haemoglobin is a red coloured iron containing pigment present in the RBCs. O2 can bind with haemoglobin in a reversible manner to form oxyhaemoglobin. Each haemoglobin molecule can carry a maximum of four molecules of O2. Binding of oxygen with haemoglobin is primarily related to partial pressure of O2. Partial pressure of CO2, hydrogen ion concentration and temperature are the other factors which can interfere with this binding. A sigmoid curve is obtained when percentage saturation of haemoglobin with O2 is plotted against the pO 2 . This curve is called the Oxygen dissociation curve (Figure 17.5) and is highly useful in studying the effect of factors like pCO2, H+ concentration, etc., on binding of O2 100 with haemoglobin. In the alveoli, where there is high pO2, low pCO2, lesser H+ concentration 80 and lower temperature, the factors are all favourable for the formation of 60 oxyhaemoglobin, whereas in the tissues, where low pO 2 , high pCO 2 , high H + 40 concentration and higher temperature exist, the conditions are favourable for dissociation 20 of oxygen from the oxyhaemoglobin.

What is meant by chloride shift ? Where does it occur in human body ? What is its utility ?,Chloride shift : The diffusion of Cl ions from blood plasma into the RBCs is known as chloride shift. It occurs from plasma to RBCs (erythrocytes) in human body. Utility of chloride shift: To maintain ionic balance and electrochemical neutrality.,"18.1.4 Coagulation of Blood You know that when you cut your finger or hurt yourself, your wound does not continue to bleed for a long time; usually the blood stops flowing after sometime. Do you know why? Blood exhibits coagulation or clotting in response to an injury or trauma. This is a mechanism to prevent excessive loss of blood from the body. You would have observed a dark reddish brown scum formed at the site of a cut or an injury over a period of time. It is a clot or coagulam formed mainly of a network of threads called fibrins in which dead and damaged formed elements of blood are trapped. Fibrins are formed by the conversion of inactive fibrinogens in the plasma by the enzyme thrombin. Thrombins, in turn are formed from another inactive substance present in the plasma called prothrombin. An enzyme complex, thrombokinase, is required for the above reaction. This complex is formed by a series of linked enzymic reactions (cascade process) involving a number of factors present in the plasma in an inactive state. An injury or a trauma stimulates the platelets in the blood to release certain factors which activate the mechanism of coagulation. Certain factors released by the tissues at the site of injury also can initiate coagulation. Calcium ions play a very important role in clotting.

Why is haemoglobin called conjugated protein ?

What happens to the leg muscle of an athlete who runs a marathon race ?,"While running a marathon race, the internal muscle respires anaerobically as they do not get the required increased supply of oxygen at that time.

Lactic acid, thus produced will be oxidised later by other tissues.","and breakage is repeated causing further sliding. The process continues till the Ca++ ions are pumped back to the sarcoplasmic cisternae resulting in the masking of actin filaments. This causes the return of ‘Z’ lines back to their original position, i.e., relaxation. The reaction time of the fibres can vary in different muscles. Repeated activation of the muscles can lead to the accumulation of lactic acid due to anaerobic breakdown of glycogen in them, causing fatigue. Muscle contains a red coloured oxygen storing pigment called myoglobin. Myoglobin content is high in some of the muscles which gives a reddish appearance. Such muscles are called the Red fibres. These muscles also contain plenty of mitochondria which can utilise the large amount of oxygen stored in them for ATP production. These muscles, therefore, can also be called aerobic muscles. On the other hand, some of the muscles possess very less quantity of myoglobin and therefore, appear pale or whitish. These are the White fibres. Number of mitochondria are also few in them, but the amount of sarcoplasmic reticulum is high. They depend on anaerobic process for energy.

Write short notes on mountain sickness.,"On mountain-tops about 8000ft. above from the sea level, one has difficulty in breathing due to considerable decrease in the oxygen in the air. Consequently, the alveolar pO 2 reduces and oxygen cannot be diffused into the blood. Thus, the process of oxygenation of blood progressively gets decreased to such an extent that the person develops mountain sickness. It produces a number of symptoms like breathlessness, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and a bluishness of skin, nails and lips. This is because of lack of adequate oxygen. People suffering from heart ailment or blood pressure should not go to such a height.  ","BREATHING
 Breathing involves two stages : inspiration during which atmospheric air is drawn in and expiration by which the alveolar air is released out. The movement of air into and out of the lungs is carried out by creating a pressure gradient between the lungs and the atmosphere. Inspiration can occur if the pressure within the lungs (intra-pulmonary pressure) is less than the atmospheric pressure, i.e., there is a negative pressure in the lungs with respect to atmospheric pressure. Similarly, expiration takes place when the intra-pulmonary pressure is higher than the atmospheric pressure. The diaphragm and a specialised set of muscles – external and internal intercostals between the ribs, help in generation of such gradients. Inspiration is initiated by the contraction of diaphragm which increases the volume of thoracic chamber in the antero-posterior axis. The contraction of external inter-costal muscles lifts up the ribs and the
 higher, it shows hypertension. High blood pressure leads to heart diseases and also affects vital organs like brain and kidney. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Coronary Artery Disease, often referred to as atherosclerosis, affects the vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle. It is caused by deposits of calcium, fat, cholesterol and fibrous tissues, which makes the lumen of arteries narrower. Angina: It is also called ‘angina pectoris’. A symptom of acute chest pain appears when no enough oxygen is reaching the heart muscle. Angina can occur in men and women of any age but it is more common among the middle-aged and elderly. It occurs due to conditions that affect the blood flow. Heart Failure: Heart failure means the state of heart when it is not pumping blood effectively enough to meet the needs of the body. It is sometimes called congestive heart failure because congestion of the lungs is one of the main symptoms of this disease. Heart failure is not the same as cardiac arrest (when the heart stops beating) or a heart attack (when the heart muscle is suddenly damaged by an inadequate blood supply).

What is water potential? What is the relationship between water potential with solute potential and pressure? ,"Water potential: It is the difference in the free energy and chemical potential per unit molal volume of water in a solution over its pure state at the same temperature and pressure. Chemical potential of pure water at normal temperature and pressure is zero. It is denoted by Ψ w. Solute potential: All solutions have lower water potential than their pure form. Thus the water potential is inversely proportional to solute concentration, because free energy of water decreases. Pressure potential: Pressure potential or turgor pressure is the pressure exerted by protoplast on cell wall. Pressure potential is + 𝑣𝑒 and denoted by Ψ p.= Ψ θ.= Ψ c.","11.2.1 Water Potential To comprehend plant-water relations, an understanding of certain Ψw) is a concept standard terms is necessary. Water potential (Ψ fundamental to understanding water movement. Solute potential Ψp) are the two main components that (Ψ Ψs) and pressure potential (Ψ determine water potential. Water molecules possess kinetic energy. In liquid and gaseous form they are in random motion that is both rapid and constant. The greater the concentration of water in a system, the greater is its kinetic energy or ‘water potential’. Hence, it is obvious that pure water will have the greatest water potential. If two systems containing water are in contact, random movement of water molecules will result in net movement of water molecules from the system with higher energy to the one with lower energy. Thus water will move from the system containing water at higher water potential to the one having low water potential. This process of movement of substances down a gradient of free energy is called diffusion. Water potential is denoted by the Greek symbol Psi or Ψ and is expressed in pressure units such as pascals (Pa). By convention, the water potential of pure water at standard temperatures, which is not under any pressure, is taken to be zero. If some solute is dissolved in pure water, the solution has fewer free water molecules and the concentration (free energy) of water decreases, reducing its water potential. Hence, all solutions have a lower water potential than pure water; the magnitude of this lowering due to dissolution of a solute is called solute potential or Ψs. Ψs is always negative. The more the solute molecules, the lower (more negative) is the Ψs . For a solution at atmospheric pressure (water potential) Ψw = (solute potential) Ψs. If a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure is applied to pure water or a solution, its water potential increases. It is equivalent to pumping water from one place to another. Can you think of any system in our body where pressure is built up? Pressure can build up in a plant system when water enters a plant cell due to diffusion causing a pressure built up against the cell wall, it makes the cell turgid (see section 11.2.2);

What are the factors controlling osmosis?,The factors controlling osmosis are as follows : (i) Presence of a semipermeable membrane. (ii) Concentration gradient of dissolved solute on the two sides of the semi-permeable membrane. (iii) Difference in pressure. ,"11.2.2 Osmosis The plant cell is surrounded by a cell membrane and a cell wall. The cell wall is freely permeable to water and substances in solution hence is not a barrier to movement. In plants the cells usually contain a large central vacuole, whose contents, the vacuolar sap, contribute to the solute potential of the cell. In plant cells, the cell membrane and the membrane of the vacuole, the tonoplast together are important determinants of movement of molecules in or out of the cell. Osmosis is the term used to refer specifically to the diffusion of water across a differentially- or selectively permeable membrane. Osmosis occurs spontaneously in response to a driving force. The net direction and rate of osmosis depends on both the pressure gradient and concentration gradient. Water will move from its region of higher chemical potential (or concentration) to its region of lower chemical potential until equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium the two chambers should have nearly the same water potential. You may have made a potato osmometer in your earlier classes in school. If the potato tuber is placed in water, the water enters the cavity in the potato tuber containing a concentrated solution of sugar due to osmosis. Study Figure 11.3 in which the two chambers, A and B, containing solutions are separated by a semi-permeable membrane.

Write a short note on plasmolysis ?,"It is the process of shrinkage of protoplasm in a cell, away from its cell wall and toward the center. It occurs because of the movement of water from the intracellular space to the outer-cellular space. This happens when the plant cell is placed in a hypertonic solution that is solution having more solute concentration than the cell cytoplasm. This causes the water to move out of the cell (endosmosis) and toward the solution. The cytoplasm of the cell shrinks and the cell is said to be plasmolysed.","the cell (or tissue) is placed in a solution that is hypertonic (has more solutes) to the protoplasm. Water moves out; it is first lost from the cytoplasm and then from the vacuole. The water when drawn out of the cell through diffusion into the extracellular (outside cell) fluid causes the protoplast to shrink away from the walls. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. The movement of water occurred across the membrane moving from an area of high water potential (i.e., the cell) to an area of lower water potential outside the cell (Figure 11.5). What occupies the space between the cell wall and the shrunken protoplast in the plasmolysed cell? When the cell (or tissue) is placed in an isotonic solution, there is no net flow of water towards the inside or outside. If the external solution balances the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm it is said to be isotonic. When water flows into the cell and out of the cell and are in equilibrium, the cells are said to be flaccid. The process of plasmolysis is usually reversible. When the cells are placed in a hypotonic solution (higher water potential or dilute solution as compared to the cytoplasm), water diffuses into the cell causing the cytoplasm to build up a pressure against the wall, that is called turgor pressure. The pressure exerted by the protoplasts due to entry of water against the rigid walls is called pressure potential Ψp.. Because of the rigidity of the cell wall, the cell does not rupture. This turgor pressure is ultimately responsible for enlargement and extension growth of cells. What would be the Ψp of a flaccid cell? Which organisms other than plants possess cell wall ?

Osmotic pressure It is the actual pressure which develops in a solution if it is separated from the water of semipermeable membrane. Osmotic pressure is measured by bar and it is equal to the osmotic potential having a positive value. It is designated as OP. ,"11.2.3 Plasmolysis The behaviour of the plant cells (or tissues) with regard to water movement depends on the surrounding solution. If the external solution balances the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm, it is said to be isotonic. If the external solution is more dilute than the cytoplasm, it is hypotonic and if the external solution is more concentrated, it is hypertonic. Cells swell in hypotonic solutions and shrink in hypertonic ones. Plasmolysis occurs when water moves out of the cell and the cell membrane of a plant cell shrinks away from its cell wall.

How does the structure of stomata help in its opening and closing.,"The immediate cause of the opening and closing of the stomata is a change in the turgidity of the guard cells. The inner wall of each guard cell, towards the pore is thick and elastic whereas the outerwall is thin. When turgidity increases within the two guard cells flanking each stomatal pore, the thin outer walls bulge out and force the inner walls into a crescent shape. The opening and closing of the stoma is also aided due to the orientation of the microfibrils in the cell walls of the guard cells. Cellulose microfibrils are oriented radially rather than longitudinals making it easier for the stoma to open.","11.4 TRANSPIRATION Transpiration is the evaporative loss of water by plants. It occurs mainly through stomata (sing. : stoma). Besides the loss of water vapour in transpiration, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the leaf also occurs through these stomata. Normally stomata are open in the day time and close during the night. The immediate cause of the opening or closing of stomata is a change in the turgidity of the guard cells. The inner wall of each guard cell, towards the pore or stomatal aperture, is thick and elastic. When turgidity increases within the two guard cells flanking each stomatal aperture or pore, the thin outer walls bulge out and force the inner walls into a crescent shape. The opening of the stoma is also aided due to the orientation of the microfibrils in the cell walls of the guard cells. Cellulose microfibrils are oriented radially rather than longitudinally making it easier for the stoma to open.

Usually the lower surface of a dorsiventral (often dicotyledonous) leaf has a greater number of stomata while in an isobilateral (often monocotyledonous) leaf they are about equal on both surfaces. Transpiration is affected by several external factors: temperature, light, humidity, wind speed.

How do rise in temperature and wind velocity affect transpiration ? Write any two adaptations shown by plants to reduce transpiration.,"(i) Temperature: If the temperature is more, the rate of transpiration increases. An increase in the temperature of leaf increases the rate of transpiration. (ii) Wind velocity : During high wind, the transpiration becomes very active because the water vapour around the leaves is instantly removed. At very high wind velocity, the stomata are closed because of rapid loss of water from the guard cells and the rate of transpiration is declined. Two adaptations shown by plants to reduce transpiration are: (i) Reduction in the surface of leaves: The leaves are modified into spines, hence no transpiration takes place. (ii) Sunken stomata : In some, the stomata get sunk. This also reduces the rate of transpiration. e.g., Nerium and Agave.","rates, up to 15 metres per hour. How is this movement accomplished? A long standing question is, whether water is ‘pushed’ or ‘pulled’ through the plant. Most researchers agree that water is mainly ‘pulled’ through the plant, and that the driving force for this process is transpiration from the leaves. This is referred to as the cohesion-tension-transpiration pull model of water transport. But, what generates this transpirational pull? Water is transient in plants. Less than 1 per cent of the water reaching the leaves is used in photosynthesis and plant growth. Most of it is lost through the stomata in the leaves. This water loss is known as transpiration. You have studied transpiration in an earlier class by enclosing a healthy plant in polythene bag and observing the droplets of water formed inside the bag. You could also study water loss from a leaf using cobalt chloride paper, which turns colour on absorbing water.
 11.4 TRANSPIRATION Transpiration is the evaporative loss of water by plants. It occurs mainly through stomata (sing. : stoma). Besides the loss of water vapour in transpiration, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the leaf also occurs through these stomata.

(iii) It depends on surface features of the leaf such as hardness of the leaf surface as well as wind speed. (iv) The thinner the boundary layer, the greater is transpiration.

The secondary growth occurs in most of the dicotyledonous roots and stems and it increases the girth (diameter) of the organs by the activity of the vascular cambium and the cork cambium. The wood is actually a secondary xylem. There are different types of wood on the basis of their composition and time of production.

What is guttation ? How it is affected by root pressure ?,"The process of exudation of liquid drops from the margins of the leaves through hydathodes is called guttation.

(b) The rate of guttation increases with the decrease in root pressure due to less absorption of water.  ","the loss of water in the form of vapours from the plant parts through stomata. Temperature, light, humidity, wind speed and number of stomata affect the rate of transpiration. Excess water is also removed through tips of leaves of plants by guttation.

The translocation in phloem is explained by the pressureflow hypothesis.

(i) Draw the labelled diagram of a nephron. (ii) What is the role of Henle’s loop?,(i)  (ii) Loop of Henle plays a significant role in the maintenance of high osmolality of medullary interstitial fluid.,"also in a counter current pattern. The proximity between the Henle’s loop and vasa recta, as well as the counter current in them help in maintaining an increasing osmolarity towards the inner medullary interstitium, i.e., from 300 mOsmolL–1 in the cortex to about 1200 mOsmolL–1 in the inner medulla. This gradient is mainly caused by NaCl and urea. NaCl is transported by the ascending limb of Henle’s loop which is exchanged with the descending limb of vasa recta. NaCl is returned to the interstitium by the ascending portion of vasa recta. Similarly, small amounts of urea enter the thin segment of the ascending limb of Henle’s loop which is transported back to the interstitium by the collecting tubule. The above described transport of substances facilitated by the special arrangement of Henle’s loop and vasa recta is called the counter current mechanism (Figure. 19.6). This mechanism helps to maintain a concentration gradient
 "
What are nephrons? Describe the types of nephrons.,"Nephrons are the structural and functional units of the kidneys. On the basis of location, the nephrons are of two types: (i) Juxta-medullary nephron: Their glomeruli are found in the inner margins of the cortex. The loop of Henle lie deep into the medulla. They are associated with vasa recta. They control plasma volume when water supply is short. (ii) Cortical nephrons: They mainly lie in the renal cortex. Their glomeruli are found in the outer cortex. The loops of Henle are short and extend to short distance of medulla. They do not have vasa recta.","(PCT). A hairpin shaped Henle’s loop is the Afferent arteriole next part of the tubule which has a descending and an ascending limb. The Efferent ascending limb continues as another highly arteriole coiled tubular region called distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The DCTs of many Bowman’s capsule nephrons open into a straight tube called collecting duct, many of which converge and open into the renal pelvis through medullary pyramids in the calyces. The Malpighian corpuscle, PCT and DCT of the nephron are situated in the cortical region of the kidney whereas the loop of Henle dips into the medulla. In majority of nephrons, the loop of Henle is too short and Proximal extends only very little into the medulla. Such convoluted tubule nephrons are called cortical nephrons. In some of the nephrons, the loop of Henle is Figure 19.4 Malpighian body (renal corpuscle) very long and runs deep into the medulla. These nephrons are called juxta medullary nephrons. The efferent arteriole emerging from the glomerulus forms a fine capillary network around the renal tubule called the peritubular capillaries. A minute vessel of this network runs parallel to the Henle’s loop forming a ‘U’ shaped vasa recta. Vasa recta is absent or highly reduced in cortical nephrons.

Describe glomerular filtration in human nephrons.,"The glomerular capillaries are narrower than the afferent renal arterioles, therefore the blood pressure in the glomerular capillaries becomes very high and there is continuous process of ultrafiltration through the semi-permeable glomerular capillaries. Filtration of blood occurs through three layers: (i) The endothelium of glomerular blood vessels. (ii) The epithelium of Bowman's capsule and (iii) The basement membrane between the two layers. The epithelial cells of Bowman's capsule called podocytes are arranged intricately so as to leave minute spaces called filtration slits. The glomerular filtrate and blood plasma are similar except that glomerular filtrate does not have proteins and fats.","19.2 URINE FORMATION Urine formation involves three main processes namely, glomerular filtration, reabsorption and secretion, that takes place in different parts of the nephron. The first step in urine formation is the filtration of blood, which is carried out by the glomerulus and is called glomerular filtration. On an average, 1100-1200 ml of blood is filtered by the kidneys per minute which constitute roughly 1/5th of the blood pumped out by each ventricle of the heart in a minute. The glomerular capillary blood pressure causes filtration of blood through 3 layers, i.e., the endothelium of glomerular blood vessels, the epithelium of Bowman’s capsule and a basement membrane between these two layers. The epithelial cells of Bowman’s capsule called podocytes are arranged in an intricate manner so as to leave some minute spaces called filtration slits or slit pores. Blood is filtered so finely through these membranes, that almost all the constituents of the plasma except the proteins pass onto the lumen of the Bowman’s capsule. Therefore, it is considered as a process of ultra filtration.

This segment allows passage of small amounts of urea into the medullary interstitium to keep up the osmolarity. It also plays a role in the maintenance of pH and ionic balance of blood by the selective secretion of H+ and K+ ions (Figure 19.5).

Distinguish between: Nephridia and Nephron.,"S. No. (i)  (ii)  Nephridia These are delicate, small coiled, complicated tubes performing excretion and are found in earth worm. They collect the waste from the body and pass them outside the animal through small openings.  Nephron It is the functional unit of kidney in vertebrates.  It is highly convoluted, delicate tubular structure. Made up cup shaped body called Bowman’s capsule. A tuft of capillaries lies in the Bowman’s capsule. The remaining part is divided into a coiled proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle and a distal convoluted tubule. ","A survey of animal kingdom presents a variety of excretory structures. In most of the invertebrates, these structures are simple tubular forms whereas vertebrates have complex tubular organs called kidneys. Some of these structures are mentioned here. Protonephridia or flame cells are the excretory structures in Platyhelminthes (Flatworms, e.g., Planaria), rotifers, some annelids and the cephalochordate – Amphioxus. Protonephridia are primarily concerned with ionic and fluid volume regulation, i.e., osmoregulation. Nephridia are the tubular excretory structures of earthworms and other annelids. Nephridia help to remove nitrogenous wastes and maintain a fluid and ionic balance. Malpighian tubules are the excretory structures of most of the insects including cockroaches. Malpighian tubules help in the removal of nitrogenous wastes and osmoregulation. Antennal glands or green glands perform the excretory function in crustaceans like prawns.
 19.1 HUMAN EXCRETORY SYSTEM In humans, the excretory system consists of a pair of kidneys, one pair of ureters, a urinary bladder and a urethra (Figure 19.1). Kidneys are reddish brown, bean shaped structures situated between the levels of last thoracic and third lumbar vertebra close to the dorsal inner wall of the abdominal cavity. Each kidney of an adult human measures 10-12 cm in length, 5-7 cm in width, 2-3 cm in thickness with an average weight of 120170 g. Towards the centre of the inner concave surface of the kidney is a notch called hilum through which ureter, blood vessels and nerves enter. Inner to the hilum is a broad funnel shaped space called the renal pelvis with projections called calyces. The outer layer of kidney is a tough capsule. Inside the kidney, there are two zones, an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The medulla is divided into a few conical masses (medullary pyramids) projecting into the calyces (sing.: calyx). The cortex extends in between the

How is glomerular filtrate hypertonic and hypotonic in descending and ascending limb of loop of Henle respectively? What is the effect of ADH on collecting tubules?,"Counter current system is found in two limbs of loop of Henle. The ascending limb transports Na+ and some urea into surrounding medullary tissue. It is impermeable to water. So it makes urine dilute or hypotonic. The walls of descending limbs are permeable of water and salt, so Na+ and water from surrounding fluid are absorbed. Thus the contents of urine become hypertonic. ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone): ADH is secreted when the osmotic pressure of blood increases due to excess loss of water from the body. The hormone renders the walls of distal convoluted tubule, collecting tubule (CT) and collecting duct of a nephron permeable to water and increases the reabsorption of water into the surrounding tissues and particular capillaries. The urine becomes hyperosmotic and less in volume and water is conserved in the body.  ","The functioning of the kidneys is efficiently monitored and regulated by hormonal feedback mechanisms involving the hypothalamus, JGA and to a certain extent, the heart. Osmoreceptors in the body are activated by changes in blood volume, body fluid volume and ionic concentration. An excessive loss of fluid from the body can activate these receptors which stimulate the hypothalamus to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin from the neurohypophysis. ADH facilitates water reabsorption from latter parts of the tubule, thereby preventing diuresis. An increase in body fluid volume can switch off the osmoreceptors and suppress the ADH release to complete the feedback. ADH can also affect the kidney function by its constrictory effects on blood vessels. This causes an increase in blood pressure. An increase in blood pressure can increase the glomerular blood flow and thereby the GFR. The JGA plays a complex regulatory role. A fall in glomerular blood flow/glomerular blood pressure/GFR can activate the JG cells to release renin which converts angiotensinogen in blood to angiotensin I and further to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, being a powerful vasoconstrictor, increases the glomerular blood pressure and thereby GFR. Angiotensin II also activates the adrenal cortex to release Aldosterone. Aldosterone causes reabsorption of Na+ and water from the distal parts of the tubule. This also leads to an increase in blood pressure and GFR. This complex mechanism is generally known as the Renin-Angiotensin mechanism. An increase in blood flow to the atria of the heart can cause the release of Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF). ANF can cause vasodilation (dilation of blood vessels) and thereby decrease the blood pressure. ANF mechanism, therefore, acts as a check on the renin-angiotensin mechanism.
 19.6 MICTURITION Urine formed by the nephrons is ultimately carried to the urinary bladder where it is stored till a voluntary signal is given by the central nervous system (CNS). This signal is initiated by the stretching of the urinary bladder as it gets filled with urine. In response, the stretch receptors on the walls of the bladder send signals to the CNS. The CNS passes on motor messages

How fall and rise in blood calcium stimulates secretion of parathyroid?,Parathyroid is under the feedback control of blood calcium level. A fall in blood calcium stimulates them to secrete parathormone. A rise in blood calcium inhibits parathormone secretion from them.,"Parathyroid Gland
 In humans, four parathyroid glands are present on the back side of the thyroid gland, one pair each in the two lobes of the thyroid gland (Figure 22.3b). The parathyroid glands secrete a peptide hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH). The secretion of PTH is regulated by the circulating levels of calcium ions. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases the Ca2+ levels in the blood. PTH acts on bones and stimulates the process of bone resorption (dissolution/ demineralisation). PTH also stimulates reabsorption of Ca2+ by the renal tubules and increases Ca2+ absorption from the digested food. It is, thus, clear that PTH is a hypercalcemic hormone, i.e., it increases the blood Ca2+ levels. Along with TCT, it plays a significant role in calcium balance in the body.

Why pituitary gland is called as master gland?,"(i) The pituitary is called ""Master Endocrine Gland"" because of number of hormones it produces and the control it exercises over other endocrine gland. (ii) It itself is under the control of the releasing- hormones secreted by the hypothalamus of the brain. Thus, there is a chain of orders : the hypothalamus directs the pituitary output, which controls the secretion of hormones by other endocrine glands.","As you know, the hypothalamus is the basal part of diencephalon, forebrain (Figure 22.1) and it regulates a wide spectrum of body functions. It contains Figure 22.1 Location of endocrine glands several groups of neurosecretory cells called nuclei which produce hormones. These hormones regulate the synthesis and secretion of pituitary hormones. However, the hormones produced by hypothalamus are of two types, the releasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary hormones) and the inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of pituitary hormones). For example a hypothalamic hormone called Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates the pituitary synthesis and release of gonadotrophins. On the other hand, somatostatin from the hypothalamus inhibits the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. These hormones originating in the hypothalamic neurons, pass through axons and are released from their nerve endings. These hormones reach the pituitary gland through a portal circulatory system and regulate the functions of the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is under the direct neural regulation of the hypothalamus (Figure 22.2).
 The Pituitary Gland
 Hypothalamic The pituitary gland is located in a bony cavity neurons called sella tursica and is attached to hypothalamus by a stalk (Figure 22.2). It is divided anatomically into an adenohypophysis and a neurohypophysis. Adenohypophysis consists of two portions, pars distalis and pars intermedia. The pars distalis region of pituitary, commonly called anterior pituitary, produces growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid Portal circulation stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle Posterior stimulating hormone (FSH). Pars intermedia pituitary secretes only one hormone called melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH). However, in Anterior humans, the pars intermedia is almost merged pituitary with pars distalis. Neurohypophysis (pars nervosa) also known as posterior pituitary, stores Figure 22.2 Diagrammatic representation of pituitary and its relationship with and releases two hormones called oxytocin and hypothalamus vasopressin, which are actually synthesised by the hypothalamus and are transported axonally to neurohypophysis. Over-secretion of GH stimulates abnormal growth of the body leading to gigantism and low secretion of GH results in stunted growth resulting in pituitary dwarfism. Excess secretion of growth hormone in adults especially in middle age can result in severe disfigurement (especially of the face) called Acromegaly, which may lead to serious complications, and premature death if unchecked. The disease is hard to diagnose in the early stages and often goes undetected for many years, until changes in external features become noticeable. Prolactin regulates the growth of the mammary glands and formation of milk in them. TSH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. ACTH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones called glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. LH and FSH stimulate gonadal activity and hence are called gonadotrophins. In males, LH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of hormones called androgens from testis. In males, FSH and androgens regulate spermatogenesis. In females, LH induces ovulation of fully mature follicles (graafian follicles) and maintains the corpus luteum, formed from the remnants of the graafian follicles

What are the conditions required for growth?,"Growth is influenced by a number of conditions which are as follows: (i) Water is required for cell elongation, maintenance of turgidity of growing cells and providing medium for enzyme action. (ii) Oxygen is essential for aerobic respiration and hence availability of energy for biosynthetic activity. (iii) Nutrients are raw materials for synthesis of protoplasm, as well as the source of energy. (iv) Light is required for tissue differentiation, synthesis of photosynthetic pigments and photosynthesis. (v) The optimum temperature for proper growth is 28-30°C (vi) Environmental signals such as light &gravity also affect certain stages of growth.","15.1.5 Conditions for Growth Why do you not try to write down what you think are necessary conditions for growth? This list may have water, oxygen and nutrients as very essential elements for growth. The plant cells grow in size by cell enlargement which in turn requires water. Turgidity of cells helps in extension growth. Thus, plant growth and further development is intimately linked to the water status of the plant. Water also provides the medium for enzymatic activities needed for growth. Oxygen helps in releasing metabolic energy essential for growth activities. Nutrients (macro and micro essential elements) are required by plants for the synthesis of protoplasm and act as source of energy. In addition, every plant organism has an optimum temperature range best suited for its growth. Any deviation from this range could be detrimental to its survival. Environmental signals such as light and gravity also affect certain phases/stages of growth.

Arrows exhibit watermelon may increase in size by upto the direction of growth of cells and 3,50,000 times. In the former, growth is organ expressed as increase in cell number; the latter expresses growth as increase in size of the cell. While the growth of a pollen tube is measured in terms of its length, an increase in surface area denotes the growth in a dorsiventral leaf.
 The growth rate shows an increase that may be arithmetic or geometrical (Figure 15.4). In arithmetic growth, following mitotic cell division, only one daughter cell continues to divide while the other differentiates and matures. The simplest expression of arithmetic growth is exemplified by a root elongating at a constant rate. Look at Figure 15.5. On plotting the length of the organ against time, a linear curve is obtained. Mathematically, it is expressed as Lt = L0 + rt Lt = length at time ‘t’ L0 = length at time ‘zero’ = growth rate / elongation per unit time.
 W0 = initial size at the beginning of the period r

Distinguish between plant and animal growth.,"S. No.  Plant growth  Animal growth  (i)  Plant growth occurs in only meristematic zones. Plant growth is constructed in a modular fashion. Development is open-ended and their structure are never complete. Firstly growth is uniform but later it becomes irregular.  In animal growth, almost all the cells increase in size. Embryonic growth is completed quite early, but mature size may be reached at specific periods.  The growth is unrestricted and diffused. The freshly formed seedling cannot be called a miniature plant.  The growth is restricted and not diffused.  (ii)  (iii)  (iv) (v)  Animals grow in a synchronous and well defined way.  The young animal looks like a miniature version of the adult. ","PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT

What is differentiation? How can you distinguish between dedifferentiation and redifferentiation ?,"The cells which are derived from root apical meristem and shoot apical meristem differentiate and mature to perform specific functions. This act leading to maturation is termed as differentiation. During this, the cells undergo a few major structural changes both in their cell walls and protoplasm. (i) In plants, the living differentiated cells can regain the capacity to divide mitotically under certain conditions. The sum of events are termed as dedifferentiation. A dedifferentiated tissue  can act as meristem. e.g., interfasicular vascular cambium, cork cambium and wound meristem. (ii) The product of dedifferentiated cells or tissues which lose the ability to divide are called redifferentiated cells and the term is known as redifferentiation. Secondary xylem and econdary phloem that form interfasicular vascular cambium, secondary cortex and cork are the examples of redifferentiated tissues.","15.2 DIFFERENTIATION, DEDIFFERENTIATION AND REDIFFERENTIATION The cells derived from root apical and shoot-apical meristems and cambium differentiate and mature to perform specific functions. This act leading to maturation is termed as differentiation. During differentiation, cells undergo few to major structural changes both in their cell walls and protoplasm. For example, to form a tracheary element, the cells would lose their protoplasm. They also develop a very strong, elastic, lignocellulosic secondary cell walls, to carry water to long distances even under extreme tension. Try to correlate the various anatomical features you encounter in plants to the functions they perform. Plants show another interesting phenomenon. The living differentiated cells, that by now have lost the capacity to divide can regain the capacity of division under certain conditions. This phenomenon is termed as dedifferentiation. For example, formation of meristems – interfascicular cambium and cork cambium from fully differentiated parenchyma cells. While doing so, such meristems/tissues are able to divide and produce cells that once again lose the capacity to divide but mature to perform specific functions, i.e., get redifferentiated. List some of the tissues in a woody dicotyledenous plant that are the products of redifferentiation. How would you describe a tumour? What would you call the parenchyma cells that are made to divide under controlled laboratory conditions during plant tissue culture? Recall, in Section 15.1.1, we have mentioned that the growth in plants is open, i.e., it can be indeterminate or determinate. Now, we may say that even differentiation in plants is open, because cells/tissues arising out of the same meristem have different structures at maturity. The final structure at maturity of a cell/tissue is also determined by the location of the cell within. For example, cells positioned away from root apical meristems differentiate as root-cap cells, while those pushed to the periphery mature as epidermis. Can you add a few more examples of open differentiation correlating the position of a cell to its position in an organ?

Q. 6 Why is ABA known as 'stress hormone'? Mention any two functions of this hormone. How are they antagonistic to gibberellins? ,"Abscisic acid is also called as stress hormone because the synthesis of abscissic acid is stimulated by drought, water logging and other adverse environmental conditions. It is produced in many parts of the plants but more abundantly inside the chloroplast of green cells. Abscisic acid owes its name to its role in the abscission of plant leaves. In preparation for winter, ABA is produced in terminal buds. This slows plant growth and directs leaf primordia to devlop scales to protect the dormant buds during the cold season. They are antagonistic to gibberellins as gibberellins promotes stem elongation while abscisics acid acts as growth inhibitor.","Why is abscisic acid also known as stress hormone?

Define plant hormone. In how many groups does plant growth regulators are classified?,"A plant hormone is a chemical substance produced naturally in plants which is translocated to another region for regulating one or more physiological reaction, when present in low concentration. Based on functions, plant growth regulators are broadly divided into two groups. (i) Growth Promoters: Such plant growth regulators are involved in growth promoting activities such as cell division, cell enlargement, pattern formation etc. These include auxins, gibberellins and cytokinins. (ii) Growth Inhibitors: Such PGRs are involved in various growth inhibiting activities such as promotion of dormancy and abscission. These indude abscisic acid and ethylene.","15.4 PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS 15.4.1 Characteristics The plant growth regulators (PGRs) are small, simple molecules of diverse chemical composition. They could be indole compounds (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA); adenine derivatives (N 6-furfurylamino purine, kinetin), derivatives of carotenoids (abscisic acid, ABA); terpenes (gibberellic acid, GA3) or gases (ethylene, C2H4). Plant growth regulators are variously described as plant growth substances, plant hormones or phytohormones in literature. The PGRs can be broadly divided into two groups based on their functions in a living plant body. One group of PGRs are involved in growth promoting activities, such as cell division, cell enlargement, pattern formation, tropic growth, flowering, fruiting and seed formation. These are also called plant growth promoters, e.g., auxins, gibberellins and cytokinins. The PGRs of the other group play an important role in plant responses to wounds and stresses of biotic and abiotic origin. They are also involved in various growth inhibiting activities such as dormancy and abscission. The PGR abscisic acid belongs to this group. The gaseous PGR, ethylene, could fit either of the groups, but it is largely an inhibitor of growth activities.

Name the plant hormone which was discovered from fungus. Give its any functions. Give four major roles of Gibberellins as a plant growth regulator. ,Gibberellin plant hormone was discovered from the fungus Gibberella fujikuroi. Its four functions are: (i) Bolting and flowering. (ii) Stem elongation and fruit elongation. (iii) Parthenocarpy. (iv) Early seed production. ,"Gibberellins
 Gibberellins are another kind of promotory PGR. There are more than 100 gibberellins (a) (b) reported from widely different organisms such as fungi and higher plants.

Gibberellins, cause fruits like apple to elongate and improve its shape. They also delay senescence. Thus, the fruits can be left on the tree longer so as to extend the market period. GA3 is used to speed up the malting process in brewing industry. Sugarcane stores carbohydrate as sugar in their stems. Spraying sugarcane crop with gibberellins increases the length of the stem, thus increasing the yield by as much as 20 tonnes per acre. Spraying juvenile conifers with GAs hastens the maturity period, thus leading to early seed production. Gibberellins also promotes bolting (internode elongation just prior to flowering) in beet, cabbages and many plants with rosette habit. 15.4.3.3 Cytokinins Cytokinins have specific effects on cytokinesis, and were discovered as kinetin (a modified form of adenine, a purine) from the autoclaved herring sperm DNA. Kinetin does not occur naturally in plants. Search for natural substances with cytokinin-like activities led to the isolation of zeatin from corn-kernels and coconut milk. Since the discovery of zeatin, several naturally occurring cytokinins, and some synthetic compounds with cell division promoting activity, have been identified.

What is abscissic acid and why it is called as stress hormone ?,"Abscisic acid is a mildly acidic growth hormone, which functions as a general growth inhibitor by counteracting other hormones or reactions mediated by them.

"What is the effect of each of the following on germination of seeds: (i) Abscisic acid, (ii) Gibberellin","(i) Abscisic acid (ABA): It is known as growth inhibitor. It is synthesised in leaves and transported to other parts of the plants by phloem. It promotes the dormancy of seeds. ABA inhibits seed germination. The dormancy of seeds is due to abscissic acid. It usually interacts with other plant growth regulators. Dormant seeds germinate when ABA is overcomed by Gibberellins. (ii) During seed germination, especially of cereals, gibberellins stimulates the production of some mRNA and hydrolytic enzymes like amylases, lipases, ribonucleases and proteases. The enzyme solubilises the reserve food of the seed which is then transferred to the embryo axis for its growth.","The ‘bakanae’ (foolish seedling) disease of rice seedlings, was caused by a fungal pathogen Gibberella fujikuroi. E. Kurosawa (1926) reported the appearance of symptoms of the disease in rice seedlings when they were treated with sterile filtrates of the fungus. The active substances were later identified as gibberellic acid. F. Skoog and his co-workers observed that from the internodal segments of tobacco stems the callus (a mass of undifferentiated cells) proliferated only if, in addition to auxins the nutrients medium was supplemented with one of the following: extracts of vascular tissues, yeast extract, coconut milk or DNA. Miller et al. (1955), later identified and crystallised the cytokinesis promoting active substance that they termed kinetin. During mid-1960s, three independent researches reported the purification and chemical characterisation of three different kinds of inhibitors: inhibitor-B, abscission II and dormin. Later all the three were proved to be chemically identical. It was named abscisic acid (ABA). H.H. Cousins (1910) confirmed the release of a volatile substance from ripened oranges that hastened the ripening of stored unripened bananas. Later this volatile substance was identified as ethylene, a gaseous PGR. Let us study some of the physiological effects of these five categories of PGRs in the next section.
 15.4.3 Physiological Effects of Plant Growth Regulators 15.4.3.1 Auxins Auxins (from Greek ‘auxein’ : to grow) was first isolated from human urine. The term ‘auxin’ is applied to the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and to other natural and synthetic compounds having certain growth regulating properties. They are generally produced by the growing apices of the stems and roots, from where they migrate to the regions of their action. Auxins like IAA and indole butyric acid (IBA) have been isolated from plants. NAA (naphthalene acetic acid) and 2, 4-D (2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic) are synthetic auxins. All these auxins have been used extensively in agricultural and horticultural practices. They help to initiate rooting in stem cuttings, an application widely used for plant propagation. Auxins promote flowering e.g. in pineapples. They help to prevent fruit and leaf drop at early stages but promote the abscission of older mature leaves and fruits. In most higher plants, the growing apical bud inhibits the growth of the lateral (axillary) buds, a phenomenon called apical dominance. Removal of shoot tips (decapitation) usually results in the growth of lateral buds (Figure 15.11). It is widely applied in tea plantations, hedge-making. Can you explain why?

What is the importance of photoperiodism ?,"Importance of photoperiodism: (i) Photoperiodism determines the season in which a particular plant shall come to flower. (ii) Knowledge of photoperiodic effect is useful in keeping some plants in vegetative growth, to obtain higher yield of tubers, rhizomes etc., or keep the plant in reproductive stage. (iii) The phenomenon has helped the plant breeders in effecting cross-breeding in plants.

What are the factors which govern the appearance of reproductive phase of flowering in angiosperms?,The factors which govern the appearance of reproductive phase of flowering in angiosperms are: (i) Completion of juvenile phase and attainment of adult phase. (ii) Exposure to suitable day length. (iii) Proper temperature. ,"The wide range in the structure of higher plants will never fail to fascinate us. Even though the angiosperms show such a large diversity in external structure or morphology, they are all characterised by presence of roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruits. In chapters 2 and 3, we talked about classification of plants based on morphological and other characteristics. For any successful attempt at classification and at understanding any higher plant (or for that matter any living organism) we need to know standard technical terms and standard definitions. We also need to know about the possible variations in different parts, found as adaptations of the plants to their environment, e.g., adaptions to various habitats, for protection, climbing, storage, etc. If you pull out any weed you will see that all of them have roots, stems and leaves. They may be bearing flowers and fruits. The underground part of the flowering plant is the root system while the portion above the ground forms the shoot system (Figure 5.1).

What are the requirements of vernalization ?,The requirements of vernalization are: (i) Low temperature is required which is usually 0-5°C. (ii) Period of low temperature treatment. (iii) Actively dividing cells. (iv) Water is required for perceiving the stimulus of vernalization (v) Aerobic respiration and proper nourishment.,"15.6 VERNALISATION There are plants for which flowering is either quantitatively or qualitatively dependent on exposure to low temperature. This phenomenon is termed vernalisation. It prevents precocious reproductive development late in the growing season, and enables the plant to have sufficient time to reach maturity. Vernalisation refers specially to the promotion of flowering by a period of low temperature. Some important food plants, wheat, barley, rye have two kinds of varieties: winter and spring varieties. The ‘spring’ variety are normally planted in the spring and come to flower and produce grain before the end of the growing season. Winter varieties, however, if planted in spring would normally fail to flower or produce mature grain within a span of a flowering season. Hence, they are planted in autumn. They germinate, and over winter come out as small seedlings, resume growth in the spring, and are harvested usually around mid-summer. Another example of vernalisation is seen in biennial plants. Biennials are monocarpic plants that normally flower and die in the second season. Sugarbeet, cabbages, carrots are some of the common biennials. Subjecting the growing of a biennial plant to a cold treatment stimulates a subsequent photoperiodic flowering response.

 leaves, chloroplasts in leaves, lateral shoot growth and adventitious shoot formation. Cytokinins help overcome the apical dominance. They promote nutrient mobilisation which helps in the delay of leaf senescence. 15.4.3.4 Ethylene Ethylene is a simple gaseous PGR. It is synthesised in large amounts by tissues undergoing senescence and ripening fruits. Influences of ethylene on plants include horizontal growth of seedlings, swelling of the axis and apical hook formation in dicot seedlings. Ethylene promotes senescence and abscission of plant organs especially of leaves and flowers. Ethylene is highly effective in fruit ripening. It enhances the respiration rate during ripening of the fruits. This rise in rate of respiration is called respiratory climactic. Ethylene breaks seed and bud dormancy, initiates germination in peanut seeds, sprouting of potato tubers. Ethylene promotes rapid internode/petiole elongation in deep water rice plants. It helps leaves/ upper parts of the shoot to remain above water. Ethylene also promotes root growth and root hair formation, thus helping the plants to increase their absorption surface. Ethylene is used to initiate flowering and for synchronising fruit-set in pineapples. It also induces flowering in mango. Since ethylene regulates so many physiological processes, it is one of the most widely used PGR in agriculture. The most widely used compound as source of ethylene is ethephon. Ethephon in an aqueous solution is readily absorbed and transported within the plant and releases ethylene slowly. Ethephon hastens fruit ripening in tomatoes and apples and accelerates abscission in flowers and fruits (thinning of cotton, cherry, walnut). It promotes female flowers in cucumbers thereby increasing the yield. 15.4.3.5 Abscisic acid As mentioned earlier, abscisic acid (ABA) was discovered for its role in regulating abscission and dormancy. But like other PGRs, it also has other wide ranging effects on plant growth and development. It acts as a general plant growth inhibitor and an inhibitor of plant metabolism. ABA inhibits seed germination. ABA stimulates the closure of stomata and increases the tolerance of plants to various kinds of stresses. Therefore, it is also called the stress hormone. ABA plays an important role in seed development, maturation and dormancy. By inducing dormancy, ABA helps seeds to withstand desiccation and other factors unfavourable for growth. In most situations, ABA acts as an antagonist to GAs. We may summarise that for any and every phase of growth, differentiation and development of plants, one or the other PGR has some role to play. Such roles could be complimentary or antagonistic. These could be individualistic or synergistic.

What is the significance of vernalization?,"The significance of vernalization are: (i) It can help in shortening the juvenile or vegetative period of plant and bring about early flowering. It is not only applicable to temperate plants but also to tropical plants. e.g, wheat, rice. (ii) It increases yield, resistance to cold and diseases.","15.6 VERNALISATION There are plants for which flowering is either quantitatively or qualitatively dependent on exposure to low temperature.

Differentiate between short day plants and long day plants.,S.No (i)  (ii) (iii) (iv) (vi)  Short day Plants (SPD) Plants flower under photoperiods of less than critical day length. Interruption during light period does not inhibit flowering. Flowering is inhibited if long dark period is interrupted midway by a flash of light. Long continuous and uninterrupted dark period is critical for flowering. Several plants flower under continuous dark if light is supplemented with sucrose.  Long day plants (LDP) Plants flower under photoperiods of more than critical day length. Interruption during light period inhibits Flowering. Flowering occurs if dark period is interrupted by light. Light period is critical for flowering. Several plants flower under continuous light. The dark period is not at all required.  ,"15.5 PHOTOPERIODISM It has been observed that some plants require a periodic exposure to light to induce flowering. It is also seen that such plants are able to measure the duration of exposure to light. For example, some plants require the exposure to light for a period exceeding a well defined critical duration, while others must be exposed to light for a period less than this critical duration before the flowering is initiated in them. The former group of plants are called long day plants while the latter ones are termed short day plants. The critical duration is different for different plants. There are many plants, however, where there is no such correlation between exposure to light duration and induction of flowering response; such plants are called day-neutral plants (Figure 15.12). It is now also

 known that not only the duration of light period but that the duration of dark period is also of equal importance. Hence, it can be said that flowering in certain plants depends not only on a combination of light and dark exposures but also their relative durations. This response of plants to periods of day/night is termed photoperiodism. It is also interesting to note that while shoot apices modify themselves into flowering apices prior to flowering, they (i.e., shoot apices of plants) by themselves cannot percieve photoperiods. The site of perception of light/dark duration are the leaves. It has been hypothesised that there is a hormonal substance(s) that is responsible for flowering. This hormonal substance migrates from leaves to shoot apices for inducing flowering only when the plants are exposed to the necessary inductive photoperiod.

What are glycans? How are they formed?,Complex carbohydrates or polysaccharides are called as glycans. They are long chains formed by polymerisation of large number of monosaccharide monomers and are joined by glycosidic bonds with loss of water. ,"9.5 POLYSACCHARIDES The acid insoluble pellet also has polysaccharides (carbohydrates) as another class of macromolecules. Polysaccharides are long chains of sugars. They are threads (literally a cotton thread) containing different monosaccharides as building blocks. For example, cellulose is a polymeric polysaccharide consisting of only one type of monosaccharide i.e., glucose. Cellulose is a homopolymer. Starch is a variant of this but present as a store house of energy in plant tissues. Animals have another variant called glycogen. Inulin is a polymer of fructose. In a polysaccharide chain (say glycogen), the right end is called the reducing end and the left end is called the non-reducing end. It has branches as shown in the form of a cartoon (Figure 9.2). Starch forms helical secondary structures. In fact, starch can hold I2 molecules in the helical portion. The starch-I2 is blue in colour. Cellulose does not contain complex helices and hence cannot hold I2.

These roots originate from the base of the stem and constitute the fibrous root system, as seen in the wheat plant (Figure 5.2b). In some plants, like grass, Monstera and the banyan tree, roots arise from parts of the plant other than the radicle and are called adventitious roots (Figure 5.2c). The main functions of the root system are absorption of water and minerals from the soil, providing a proper anchorage to the plant parts, storing reserve food material and synthesis of plant growth regulators.

In how many groups does polysaccharide classified?,"Polysaccharides are classified into two group: (i) Homopolysaccharides or Homoglycans: These are formed by polymerisation of only one type of monosaccharide monomers. For e.g., starch, glycogen, cellulose is composed of a single type of monosaccharide called glucose, (ii) Heteropolysaccharide or Heteroglycans: These are produced by condensation of two or more types of monosaccharide derivatives. They include agar, peptidoglycan, arabino xylans etc. ","9.5 POLYSACCHARIDES The acid insoluble pellet also has polysaccharides (carbohydrates) as another class of macromolecules.

How is a peptide bond formed?,"(i) Amino acids condense to form peptide. In this process, the carboxylic group of one amino acid joins with the amino group of another amino acid with a loss of water molecule. (ii) The bond thus formed (-CO-NH-) is called amide or peptide bond. A chain of two amino acid is called dipeptide, that of three is tripeptide and many is polypeptide.","(ii) Transamination : It involves the transfer of amino group from one amino acid to the keto group of a keto acid. Glutamic acid is the main amino acid from which the transfer of NH2, the amino group takes place and other amino acids are formed through transamination. The enzyme transaminase catalyses all such reactions. For example,
 The two most important amides – asparagine and glutamine – found in plants are a structural part of proteins. They are formed from two amino acids, namely aspartic acid and glutamic acid, respectively, by addition of another amino group to each. The hydroxyl part of the acid is replaced by another NH2– radicle. Since amides contain more nitrogen than the amino acids, they are transported to other parts of the plant via xylem vessels. In addition, along with the transpiration stream the nodules of some plants (e.g., soyabean) export the fixed nitrogen as ureides. These compounds also have a particularly high nitrogen to carbon ratio.
 In a polypeptide or a protein, amino acids are linked by a peptide bond which is formed when the carboxyl (-COOH) group of one amino acid reacts with the amino (-NH2) group of the next amino acid with the elimination of a water moiety (the process is called dehydration). In a polysaccharide the individual monosaccharides are linked by a glycosidic bond. This bond is also formed by dehydration. This bond is formed between two carbon atoms of two adjacent monosaccharides. In a nucleic acid a phosphate moiety links the 3’-carbon of one sugar of one nucleotide to the 5’-carbon of the sugar of the succeeding nucleotide. The bond between the phosphate and hydroxyl group of sugar is an ester bond. As there is one such ester bond on either side, it is called phosphodiester bond (Figure 9.5). Nucleic acids exhibit a wide variety of secondary structures. For example, one of the secondary structures exhibited by DNA is the famous Watson-Crick model. This model says that DNA exists as a double helix. The two strands of polynucleotides are antiparallel i.e., run in the opposite direction. The backbone is formed by the sugarphosphate-sugar chain. The nitrogen bases are projected more or less perpendicular to this backbone but face inside. A and G of one strand compulsorily base pairs with T and C, respectively, on the other strand.

What do you understand by denaturation?,They are organic acids having both carboxylic acid group (COOH) and amino group (NH2) generally attached to α-carbon. Carboxylic group provides an acidic property to the amino acid while amino group gives it a basic reaction. The 𝑎-carbon also bears a variable hydrocarbon or alkyl group R and hydrogen. ,"types. The R group in these proteinaceous amino acids could be a hydrogen (the amino acid is called glycine), a methyl group (alanine), hydroxy methyl (serine), etc. Three of the twenty are shown in Figure 9.1. The chemical and physical properties of amino acids are essentially of the amino, carboxyl and the R functional groups. Based on number of amino and carboxyl groups, there are acidic (e.g., glutamic acid), basic (lysine) and neutral (valine) amino acids. Similarly, there are aromatic amino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan). A particular property of amino acids is the ionizable nature of –NH2 and –COOH groups. Hence in solutions of different pH, the structure of amino acids changes.

How does temperature effect an enzyme catalyzed reaction ?,"(i) The temperature affects the velocity of enzyme action.    (ii) When the temperature is high, there is a sudden decrease in enzyme action due to denaturation.

These include temperature, pH, change in substrate concentration or binding of specific chemicals that regulate its activity. Temperature and pH Enzymes generally function in a narrow range of temperature and pH (Figure 9.7). Each enzyme shows its highest activity at a particular temperature and pH called the optimum temperature and optimum pH. Activity declines both below and above the optimum value. Low temperature preserves the enzyme in a temporarily inactive state whereas high temperature destroys enzymatic activity because proteins are denatured by heat.

What do you understand by diffusion pressure?,The pressure exerted by the tendency of the particles to diffuse from the region of its higher concentration to the region of its lower concentration is called diffusion pressure. It is proportional to the concentration of diffusing particles.,"a gradient is present for CO2 in the opposite direction, i.e., from tissues to blood and blood to alveoli. As the solubility of CO2 is 20-25 times higher than that of O2, the amount of CO2 that can diffuse through the diffusion membrane per unit difference in partial pressure is much higher compared to that of O2. The diffusion membrane is made up of three major layers (Figure 17.4) namely, the thin squamous epithelium of alveoli, the endothelium of alveolar capillaries and the basement substance (composed of a thin basement membrane supporting the squamous epithelium and the basement membrane surrounding the single layer endothelial cells of capillaries) in between them. However, its total thickness is much less than a millimetre. Therefore, all the factors Figure 17.4 A Diagram of a section of an in our body are favourable for diffusion of alveolus with a pulmonary O2 from alveoli to tissues and that of CO2 capillary. from tissues to alveoli.

Define membrane permeability. On what factors does it depend?,"Membrane permeability is the ability of a membrane to allow passage of gases, liquids, solutes through it. It is dependent upon two factors: (i) Nature of membrane (composition), (ii) Nature of passing substance.","An improved model of the structure of cell membrane was proposed by Singer and Nicolson (1972) widely accepted as fluid mosaic model (Figure 8.4). According to this, the quasi-fluid nature of lipid enables lateral movement of proteins within the overall bilayer. This ability to move within the membrane is measured as its fluidity. The fluid nature of the membrane is also important from the point of view of functions like cell growth, formation of intercellular junctions, secretion, endocytosis, cell division etc. One of the most important functions of the plasma membrane is the transport of the molecules across it. The membrane is selectively permeable to some molecules present on either side of it. Many molecules can move briefly across the membrane without any requirement of energy and this is called the passive transport. Neutral solutes may move across the membrane by the process of simple diffusion along the concentration gradient, i.e., from higher concentration to the lower. Water may also move across this membrane from higher to lower concentration. Movement of water by diffusion is called osmosis. As the polar molecules cannot pass through the nonpolar lipid bilayer, they require a carrier protein of the membrane to facilitate their transport across the membrane. A few ions or molecules are transported across the membrane against their concentration gradient, i.e., from lower to the higher concentration. Such a transport is an energy dependent process, in which ATP is utilised and is called active transport, e.g., Na+/K+ Pump.
 "
What is reverse osmosis? How it is useful?,It is the expulsion of pure water from a solution through a semi-permeable membrane under the influence of pressure higher than the osmotic pressure of the solution. Use: Reverse osmosis is used in removing salts from saline water as well as extra purification of water.,"11.2.2 Osmosis The plant cell is surrounded by a cell membrane and a cell wall. The cell wall is freely permeable to water and substances in solution hence is not a barrier to movement. In plants the cells usually contain a large central vacuole, whose contents, the vacuolar sap, contribute to the solute potential of the cell. In plant cells, the cell membrane and the membrane of the vacuole, the tonoplast together are important determinants of movement of molecules in or out of the cell. Osmosis is the term used to refer specifically to the diffusion of water across a differentially- or selectively permeable membrane. Osmosis occurs spontaneously in response to a driving force. The net direction and rate of osmosis depends on both the pressure gradient and concentration gradient. Water will move from its region of higher chemical potential (or concentration) to its region of lower chemical potential until equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium the two chambers should have nearly the same water potential. You may have made a potato osmometer in your earlier classes in school. If the potato tuber is placed in water, the water enters the cavity in the potato tuber containing a concentrated solution of sugar due to osmosis. Study Figure 11.3 in which the two chambers, A and B, containing solutions are separated by a semi-permeable membrane.
 Let us discuss another experiment where a solution of sucrose in water taken in a funnel is separated from pure water in a beaker by a selectively permeable membrane (Figure 11.4). You can get this kind of a membrane in an egg. Remove the yolk and albumin through a small hole at one end of the egg, and place the shell in dilute solution of hydrochloric acid for a few hours. The egg shell dissolves leaving the membrane intact. Water will move into the funnel, resulting in rise in the level of the solution in the funnel. This will continue till the equilibrium is reached. In case sucrose does diffuse out through the membrane, will this equilibrium be ever reached? External pressure can be applied from the upper part of the funnel such that no water diffuses into the funnel through the membrane. This pressure required to prevent water from diffusing is in fact, the osmotic pressure and this is the function of the solute concentration; more the solute concentration, greater will be the pressure required to prevent water from diffusing in. Numerically osmotic pressure is equivalent to the osmotic potential, but the sign is opposite.Osmotic pressure is the positive pressure applied, while osmotic potential is negative.
 11.2.3 Plasmolysis The behaviour of the plant cells (or tissues) with regard to water movement depends on the surrounding solution. If the external solution balances the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm, it is said to be isotonic. If the external solution is more dilute than the cytoplasm, it is hypotonic and if the external solution is more concentrated, it is hypertonic. Cells swell in hypotonic solutions and shrink in hypertonic ones. Plasmolysis occurs when water moves out of the cell and the cell membrane of a plant cell shrinks away from its cell wall. This occurs when
 "
Write a short note on deplasmolysis.,"Deplasmolysis: (i) If a plasmolysed cell is placed in pure water or hypotonic solution, endosmosis takes place. (ii) The protoplast attains its original shape and the cell regain its original size. (iii) The swelling up of a plasmolysed protoplast due to endosmosis under the influence of a hypotonic solution or water is called deplasmolysis. (iv) It is possible immediately after plasmolysis otherwise the cell protoplast becomes perma nently damaged.","the cell (or tissue) is placed in a solution that is hypertonic (has more solutes) to the protoplasm. Water moves out; it is first lost from the cytoplasm and then from the vacuole. The water when drawn out of the cell through diffusion into the extracellular (outside cell) fluid causes the protoplast to shrink away from the walls. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. The movement of water occurred across the membrane moving from an area of high water potential (i.e., the cell) to an area of lower water potential outside the cell (Figure 11.5). What occupies the space between the cell wall and the shrunken protoplast in the plasmolysed cell? When the cell (or tissue) is placed in an isotonic solution, there is no net flow of water towards the inside or outside. If the external solution balances the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm it is said to be isotonic. When water flows into the cell and out of the cell and are in equilibrium, the cells are said to be flaccid. The process of plasmolysis is usually reversible. When the cells are placed in a hypotonic solution (higher water potential or dilute solution as compared to the cytoplasm), water diffuses into the cell causing the cytoplasm to build up a pressure against the wall, that is called turgor pressure. The pressure exerted by the protoplasts due to entry of water against the rigid walls is called pressure potential Ψp.. Because of the rigidity of the cell wall, the cell does not rupture. This turgor pressure is ultimately responsible for enlargement and extension growth of cells. What would be the Ψp of a flaccid cell? Which organisms other than plants possess cell wall ?

 membrane. This movement is dependent on the gradient. The apoplast does not provide any barrier to water movement and water movement is through mass flow. As water evaporates into the intercellular spaces or the atmosphere, tension develop in the continuous stream of water in the apoplast, hence mass flow of water occurs due to the adhesive and cohesive properties of water. The symplastic system is the system of interconnected protoplasts. Neighbouring cells are connected through cytoplasmic strands that extend through plasmodesmata. During symplastic movement, the water travels through the cells – their cytoplasm; intercellular movement is through the plasmodesmata. Water has to enter the cells through the cell membrane, hence the movement is relatively slower. Movement is again down a potential gradient. Symplastic movement may be aided by cytoplasmic streaming. You may have observed cytoplasmic streaming in cells of the Hydrilla leaf; the movement of chloroplast due to streaming is easily visible. Most of the water flow in the roots occurs via the apoplast since the cortical cells are loosely packed, and hence offer no resistance to water movement. However, the inner boundary of the cortex, the endodermis, is impervious to water because of a band of suberised matrix called the casparian strip. Water molecules are unable to penetrate the layer, so they are directed to wall regions that are not suberised, into the cells proper through the membranes. The water then moves through the symplast and again crosses a membrane to reach the cells of the xylem. The movement of water through the root layers is ultimately symplastic in the endodermis. This is the only way water and other solutes can Endodermis Xylem enter the vascular cylinder. Once inside the xylem, water is again free to move between cells as Symplastic path well as through them. In young roots, water enters directly into the xylem vessels and/or tracheids. These are non-living conduits and so are parts of the apoplast. The path of water and mineral ions into the root vascular system is summarised in Figure 11.7.

Characteristics of fatty acids are: (i) Has a long chain of carbon atoms. (ii) Is insoluble in water. (iii) Is soluble in organic solvents. (iv) Must leave an oily spot on a piece of paper. (i) Saturated fatty acids : They do not have any double bond in between carbon atoms of molecular chain. Examples are: Palmitic acid - CH3 (CH2)14СООН Stearic acid – CH3 (CH2)16СООН (ii) Unsaturated fatty acids: They have one or more double bonds in between carbon atoms of molecular chain. Unsaturated fatty acids have lower melting points as compared to saturated fatty acids. Examples are: Oleic acid – CH3 (CH2)7CH = CH(CH2)7 COOH Linoleic acid – CH3 (CH2)4CH = (CHCH2)2 (CH2)6 COOH,"types. The R group in these proteinaceous amino acids could be a hydrogen (the amino acid is called glycine), a methyl group (alanine), hydroxy methyl (serine), etc. Three of the twenty are shown in Figure 9.1. The chemical and physical properties of amino acids are essentially of the amino, carboxyl and the R functional groups. Based on number of amino and carboxyl groups, there are acidic (e.g., glutamic acid), basic (lysine) and neutral (valine) amino acids. Similarly, there are aromatic amino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan). A particular property of amino acids is the ionizable nature of –NH2 and –COOH groups. Hence in solutions of different pH, the structure of amino acids changes.
 B is called zwitterionic form. Lipids are generally water insoluble. They could be simple fatty acids. A fatty acid has a carboxyl group attached to an R group. The R group could be a methyl (–CH3), or ethyl (–C2H5) or higher number of –CH2 groups (1 carbon to 19 carbons). For example, palmitic acid has 16 carbons including carboxyl carbon. Arachidonic acid has 20 carbon atoms including the carboxyl carbon. Fatty acids could be saturated (without double bond) or unsaturated (with one or more C=C double bonds). Another simple lipid is glycerol which is trihydroxy propane. Many lipids have both glycerol and fatty acids. Here the fatty acids are found esterified with glycerol. They can be then monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides. These are also called fats and oils based on melting point. Oils have lower melting point (e.g., gingelly oil) and hence remain as oil in winters. Can you identify a fat from the market? Some lipids have phosphorous and a phosphorylated organic compound in them. These are phospholipids. They are found in cell membrane. Lecithin is one example. Some tissues especially the neural tissues have lipids with more complex structures. Living organisms have a number of carbon compounds in which heterocyclic rings can be found. Some of these are nitrogen bases – adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, and thymine. When found attached to a sugar, they are called nucleosides. If a phosphate group is also found esterified to the sugar they are called nucleotides. Adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and cytidine are nucleosides. Adenylic acid, thymidylic acid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid and cytidylic acid are nucleotides. Nucleic acids like DNA and RNA consist of nucleotides only. DNA and RNA function as genetic material.

Differentiate between anabolic and catabolic pathways. How are the pathways regulated ?,"(i) Mucopolysaccharides are the slimy substances or mucilages which possess acidic or aminated polysaccharides formed from galactose, mannose, sugar derivatives and uronic acids. (ii) They are found inside the plant cell walls, outside the cells or bodies of bacteria, bluegreen algae, cementing layer between cells, inside body fluids, connective tissues and cartilages.","9.5 POLYSACCHARIDES The acid insoluble pellet also has polysaccharides (carbohydrates) as another class of macromolecules. Polysaccharides are long chains of sugars. They are threads (literally a cotton thread) containing different monosaccharides as building blocks. For example, cellulose is a polymeric polysaccharide consisting of only one type of monosaccharide i.e., glucose. Cellulose is a homopolymer. Starch is a variant of this but present as a store house of energy in plant tissues. Animals have another variant called glycogen. Inulin is a polymer of fructose. In a polysaccharide chain (say glycogen), the right end is called the reducing end and the left end is called the non-reducing end. It has branches as shown in the form of a cartoon (Figure 9.2). Starch forms helical secondary structures. In fact, starch can hold I2 molecules in the helical portion. The starch-I2 is blue in colour. Cellulose does not contain complex helices and hence cannot hold I2.
 Plant cell walls are made of cellulose. Paper made from plant pulp and cotton fibre is cellulosic. There are more complex polysaccharides in nature. They have as building blocks, amino-sugars and chemically modified sugars (e.g., glucosamine, N-acetyl galactosamine, etc.). Exoskeletons of arthropods, for example, have a complex polysaccharide called chitin. These complex polysaccharides are mostly homopolymers.
 9.6 NUCLEIC ACIDS The other type of macromolecule that one would find in the acid insoluble fraction of any living tissue is the nucleic acid. These are polynucleotides. Together with polysaccharides and polypeptides these comprise the true macromolecular fraction of any living tissue or cell. For nucleic acids, the building block is a nucleotide. A nucleotide has three chemically distinct components. One is a heterocyclic compound, the second is a monosaccharide and the third a phosphoric acid or phosphate. As you notice in Figure 9.1, the heterocyclic compounds in nucleic acids are the nitrogenous bases named adenine, guanine, uracil, cytosine, and thymine. Adenine and Guanine are substituted purines while the rest are substituted pyrimidines. The skeletal heterocyclic ring is called as purine and pyrimidine respectively. The sugar found in polynucleotides is either ribose (a monosaccharide pentose) or 2’ deoxyribose. A nucleic acid containing deoxyribose is called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) while that which contains ribose is called ribonucleic acid (RNA).

(i) On what basis are enzymes classified ? (ii) List any four classes of enzymes and mention their functions ? ,"Enzymes are classified according to their function and type of reaction in which they are taking part. Four main classes of enzymes are : (i) Oxidoreductases : These enzymes catalyze oxidation and reduction reactions, usually involving the transfer of hydrogen from one molecule to another. S reduced + S’ oxidized ------S oxidized + S’ reduced (ii) Transferases : These enzymes transfer a chemical group from one substrate to another but never hydrogen e.g. phosphotransferase catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from one molecule to another. (iii) Hydrolases : These enzymes carry out hydrolysis reactions i.e., breakdown of large molecules by addition of water e.g. lipases breakdown lipids into fatty acids and glycerol. (iv) Ligase or synthetase : These enzymes form bonds to join two molecules together, using energy supplied from the breakdown of ATP e.g. DNA ligase is used to repair breaks in DNA molecules. ","In the absence of any enzyme this reaction is very slow, with about 200 molecules of H2CO3 being formed in an hour. However, by using the enzyme present within the cytoplasm called carbonic anhydrase, the reaction speeds dramatically with about 600,000 molecules being formed every second. The enzyme has accelerated the reaction rate by about 10 million times. The power of enzymes is incredible indeed! There are thousands of types of enzymes each catalysing a unique chemical or metabolic reaction. A multistep chemical reaction, when each of the steps is catalysed by the same enzyme complex or different enzymes, is called a metabolic pathway. For example, Glucose → 2 Pyruvic acid C6H12O6 + O2 → 2C3H4 O3 + 2H2O is actually a metabolic pathway in which glucose becomes pyruvic acid through ten different enzyme catalysed metabolic reactions. When you study respiration in Chapter 14 you will study these reactions. At this stage you should know that this very metabolic pathway with one or two additional reactions gives rise to a variety of metabolic end products. In our skeletal muscle, under anaerobic conditions, lactic acid is formed. Under normal aerobic conditions, pyruvic acid is formed. In yeast, during fermentation, the same pathway leads to the production of ethanol (alcohol). Hence, in different conditions different products are possible.
 9.12.2 How do Enzymes bring about such High Rates of Chemical Conversions? To understand this we should study enzymes a little more. We have already understood the idea of an ‘active site’. The chemical or metabolic conversion refers to a reaction. The chemical which is converted into a product is called a ‘substrate’. Hence enzymes, i.e. proteins with three dimensional structures including an ‘active site’, convert a substrate (S) into a product (P). Symbolically, this can be depicted as: S →P It is now understood that the substrate ‘S’ has to bind the enzyme at its ‘active site’ within a given cleft or pocket. The substrate has to diffuse
 9.12.5 Classification and Nomenclature of Enzymes Thousands of enzymes have been discovered, isolated and studied. Most of these enzymes have been classified into different groups based on the type of reactions they catalyse. Enzymes are divided into 6 classes each with 4-13 subclasses and named accordingly by a four-digit number. Oxidoreductases/dehydrogenases: Enzymes which catalyse oxidoreduction between two substrates S and S’ e.g., S reduced + S’ oxidised → S oxidised + S’ reduced. Transferases: Enzymes catalysing a transfer of a group, G (other than hydrogen) between a pair of substrate S and S’ e.g., S - G + S’ → S + S’ - G Hydrolases: Enzymes catalysing hydrolysis of ester, ether, peptide, glycosidic, C-C, C-halide or P-N bonds. Lyases: Enzymes that catalyse removal of groups from substrates by mechanisms other than hydrolysis leaving double bonds.

State the effect of chemicals on enzyme action with suitable example. ,"The enzymes are proteins having high molecular weight. Enzymes are highly specific in their action. Enzymes action can be inhibited by certain chemicals. It is called enzyme inhibition, e.g. noncompetitive inhibition. Non-competitive inhibition : Some chemicals act like poison and destroy the enzyme structure. Non-competitive inhibitors do not resemble the substrate in structure. They inhibit the enzyme action by binding to the enzyme at the place other than the active site, e.g. cyanide inhibits the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase which is necessary for respiration.","Concentration of Substrate With the increase in substrate concentration, the velocity of the enzymatic reaction rises at first. The reaction ultimately reaches a maximum velocity (Vmax) which is not exceeded by any further rise in concentration of the substrate. This is because the enzyme molecules are fewer than the substrate molecules and after saturation of these molecules, there are no free enzyme molecules to bind with the additional substrate molecules (Figure 9.7). The activity of an enzyme is also sensitive to the presence of specific chemicals that bind to the enzyme. When the binding of the chemical shuts off enzyme activity, the process is called inhibition and the chemical is called an inhibitor. When the inhibitor closely resembles the substrate in its molecular structure and inhibits the activity of the enzyme, it is known as competitive inhibitor. Due to its close structural similarity with the substrate, the inhibitor competes with the substrate for the substratebinding site of the enzyme. Consequently, the substrate cannot bind and as a result, the enzyme action declines, e.g., inhibition of succinic dehydrogenase by malonate which closely resembles the substrate succinate in structure. Such competitive inhibitors are often used in the control of bacterial pathogens.

Enzymes are classified into different groups based on the reaction they catalyse. Write the name and function of each of these groups of enzymes.  In how many categories are enzymes classified?   ,"The modern system of enzyme classification was introduced by International Union of Biochemistry. It grouped enzymes into the following six categories : (i) Oxidoreductases : They take part in oxidation and reduction reactions or transfer of electrons. (ii) Transferases : They transfer group from one molecule to another e.g., glutamate pyruvate transaminase. (iii) Hydrolases : They break up large molecules into smaller ones with the help of hydrogen and hydroxyl groups of water molecules. The phenomenon is called hydrolysis. (iv) Lyases : The enzyme cause cleavage, removal of groups without hydrolysis, addition of groups to double bonds or reverse. e.g. aldolase. (v) Isomerase : The enzyme causes rearrangment of molecular structure to effect isomeric changes. These are of three types-isomerases, epimerases, mutase. (vi) Ligases : The enzyme catalyse bonding of two chemicals with the help of energy obtained from ATP.

What are the characteristics of enzymes?,"Enzymes-characteristics: (i) Approximately all the enzymes are proteinaceous in nature. An enzyme/protein has a primary structure (amino acid sequence of protein). Enzyme like protein has secondary and the tertiary structure. (ii) The backbone of protein chain folds upon itself, chain criss-crosses itself and so several crevices or pockets are made out. One pocket is known as ‘active site'. So the enzymes, through their active site, catalyse reactions at a high rate.  (iii) The enzymes get denatured at a high temperatures (above 40°C). The enzymes isolated from organisms who live under extremely high temperatures e.g., hot vents and sulphur springs, are stable and retain their catalytic power at high temperatures (upto 80°-90°C). (Any three)","9.12 ENZYMES Almost all enzymes are proteins. There are some nucleic acids that behave like enzymes. These are called ribozymes. One can depict an enzyme by a line diagram. An enzyme like any protein has a primary structure, i.e., amino acid sequence of the protein. An enzyme like any protein has the secondary and the tertiary structure. When you look at a tertiary structure (Figure 9.4 b) you will notice that the backbone of the protein chain folds upon itself, the chain criss-crosses itself and hence, many crevices or pockets are made. One such pocket is the ‘active site’. An active site of an enzyme is a crevice or pocket into which the substrate fits. Thus enzymes, through their active site, catalyse reactions at a high rate. Enzyme catalysts differ from inorganic catalysts in many ways, but one major difference needs mention. Inorganic catalysts work efficiently at high temperatures and high pressures, while enzymes get damaged at high temperatures (say above 40°C). However, enzymes isolated from organisms who normally live under extremely high temperatures (e.g., hot vents and sulphur springs), are stable and retain their catalytic power even at high temperatures (upto 80°-90°C). Thermal stability is thus an important quality of such enzymes isolated from thermophilic organisms.
 "
What is activation energy?,"Activation energy: It is the energy required to initiate a chemical or biochemical reaction. Activation energy overcomes the energy barrier of the reactants which occurs amongst the reactants due to (i) presence of electrons over their surface, (ii) absence of precise and forceful collisions, essential for bringing the reactive sites of the chemical together.  Fig. Activation energy requirement of non catalysed and enzyme catalysed chemical reaction","towards the ‘active site’. There is thus, an obligatory formation of an ‘ES’ complex. E Activation energy stands for enzyme. This complex formation is without enzyme a transient phenomenon. During the state where substrate is bound to the enzyme active site, a new structure of the substrate called Activation transition state structure is formed. Very soon, energy with enzyme after the expected bond breaking/making is Substrate (s) completed, the product is released from the active site. In other words, the structure of substrate gets transformed into the structure of product(s). The pathway of this transformation must go through the so-called Product (P) transition state structure. There could be many more ‘altered structural states’ between Progress of reaction the stable substrate and the product. Implicit Figure 9.6 Concept of activation energy in this statement is the fact that all other intermediate structural states are unstable. Stability is something related to energy status of the molecule or the structure. Hence, when we look at this pictorially through a graph it looks like something as in Figure 9.6. The y-axis represents the potential energy content. The x-axis represents the progression of the structural transformation or states through the ‘transition state’. You would notice two things. The energy level difference between S and P. If ‘P’ is at a lower level than ‘S’, the reaction is an exothermic reaction. One need not supply energy (by heating) in order to form the product. However, whether it is an exothermic or spontaneous reaction or an endothermic or energy requiring reaction, the ‘S’ has to go through a much higher energy state or transition state. The difference in average energy content of ‘S’ from that of this transition state is called ‘activation energy’. Enzymes eventually bring down this energy barrier making the transition of ‘S’ to ‘P’ more easy.

What is enzymatic competitive inhibition? Give one example. 13]  [KVS 2012- ,"Enzymatic Competitive Inhibition: (i) Chemicals that prevent the enzyme to function, are known as inhibitors. (ii) Enzymatic competitive inhibition is done by the substance which closely resembles the substrate in its molecular structure. (iii) Enzyme + Inhibitor = Enzyme-inhibitor complex. (iv) The activity of the enzyme is limited by competitive inhibitor and no product is formed. Example: Malonate inhibits the action of succinic dehydrogenase because it shows close resemblance with the succinate substrate.","Concentration of Substrate With the increase in substrate concentration, the velocity of the enzymatic reaction rises at first. The reaction ultimately reaches a maximum velocity (Vmax) which is not exceeded by any further rise in concentration of the substrate.

Describe the steps of catalytic cycle of an enzyme action. Enlist four steps involved in catalytic action of an enzyme.    ,"Steps of catalytic cycle of an enzyme action are: (i) The substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme. (ii) This binding of the substrate induces the enzymes to alter its shape and fit more closely around the substrate. (iii) The active site of the enzyme, now is in close proximity of the substrate breaks the chemical bonds of the substrate and an enzyme-product complex is formed. (iv) The enzyme releases the products of the reaction and the free enzyme is ready to take up another molecule of the substrate.","The catalytic cycle of an enzyme action can be described in the following steps: 1. First, the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, fitting into the active site. 2. The binding of the substrate induces the enzyme to alter its shape, fitting more tightly around the substrate. 3. The active site of the enzyme, now in close proximity of the substrate breaks the chemical bonds of the substrate and the new enzyme- product complex is formed. 4. The enzyme releases the products of the reaction and the free enzyme is ready to bind to another molecule of the substrate and run through the catalytic cycle once again.

What is the effect of increase in substrate concentration on the rate of enzymatic reaction ? ,Increase in substrate concentration increases the rate of reaction. The enhanced rate is due to two factors : (i) Occupation of one and more active sites by the substrate molecules. (ii) Higher number of collisions between substrate molecules. The rise in velocity is quite high in the beginning but it decreases progressively with the increase in substrate concentration.  ,"Concentration of Substrate With the increase in substrate concentration, the velocity of the enzymatic reaction rises at first. The reaction ultimately reaches a maximum velocity (Vmax) which is not exceeded by any further rise in concentration of the substrate. This is because the enzyme molecules are fewer than the substrate molecules and after saturation of these molecules, there are no free enzyme molecules to bind with the additional substrate molecules (Figure 9.7). The activity of an enzyme is also sensitive to the presence of specific chemicals that bind to the enzyme. When the binding of the chemical shuts off enzyme activity, the process is called inhibition and the chemical is called an inhibitor. When the inhibitor closely resembles the substrate in its molecular structure and inhibits the activity of the enzyme, it is known as competitive inhibitor. Due to its close structural similarity with the substrate, the inhibitor competes with the substrate for the substratebinding site of the enzyme. Consequently, the substrate cannot bind and as a result, the enzyme action declines, e.g., inhibition of succinic dehydrogenase by malonate which closely resembles the substrate succinate in structure. Such competitive inhibitors are often used in the control of bacterial pathogens.

What is the role of sarcoplasmic reticulum myosin head and F-actin during contraction of striated muscles of hormones. ,(i) Sarcoplasmic reticulum: It releases calcium ions into the sarcoplasm that binds to troponin causing a change in its shape and position and thereby remove the masking of active sites for myosin. (ii) Myosin head: The myosin head is an active ATPase enzyme and has binding sites for ATP and active sites for actin. It binds to the exposed active sites on actin to form a cross bridge. (iii) F-actin: The actin sites on the F-actin are specific to the mysoin head for cross-bridge formation.,"20.2.1 Structure of Contractile Proteins Each actin (thin) filament is made of two ‘F’ (filamentous) actins helically wound to each other. Each ‘F’ actin is a polymer of monomeric ‘G’ (Globular) actins. Two filaments of another protein, tropomyosin also run close to the ‘F’ actins throughout its length. A complex protein Troponin is distributed at regular intervals on the tropomyosin. In the resting state a subunit of troponin masks the active binding sites for myosin on the actin filaments (Figure 20.3a). Each myosin (thick) filament is also a polymerised protein. Many monomeric proteins called Meromyosins (Figure 20.3b) constitute one thick filament. Each meromyosin has two important parts, a globular head with a short arm and a tail, the former being called the heavy meromyosin (HMM) and the latter, the light meromyosin (LMM). The HMM component, i.e.; the head and short arm projects outwards at regular distance and angle from each other from the surface of a polymerised myosin filament and is known as cross arm. The globular head is an active ATPase enzyme and has binding sites for ATP and active sites for actin.
 (a)
 Actin binding sites
 Muscle contraction is initiated by a signal sent by the central nervous system (CNS) via a motor neuron. A motor neuron alongwith the muscle fibres connected to it constitute a motor unit. The junction between a motor neuron and the sarcolemma of the muscle fibre is called the neuromuscular junction or motor-end plate. A neural signal reaching this junction releases a neurotransmitter (Acetyl choline) which generates an action potential in the sarcolemma. This spreads through the muscle fibre and causes the release of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. Increase in Ca++ level leads to the binding of calcium with a subunit of troponin on actin filaments and thereby remove the masking of active sites for myosin. Utilising the energy from ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head now binds to the exposed active sites on actin to form a cross bridge (Figure 20.4). This

Describe isotonic and isometric contractions.,(i) Isotonic contractions: The force exerted on a muscle by lift and load. The muscle contraction is said to be isotonic (in a constant tension) since the load remains constant throughout the period of shortening of muscle. (ii) Isometric contraction: Shortening is prevented by maintaining the muscle at a fixed length. The development of tension occurs at the constant muscle length. This type of contraction is said to be in isometric contraction (constant length).,"20.2.2 Mechanism of Muscle Contraction Mechanism of muscle contraction is best explained by the sliding filament theory which states that contraction of a muscle fibre takes place by the sliding of the thin filaments over the thick filaments.

How many pairs of ribs are found and what are they called?,"There are 12 pairs of ribs which form the bony lateral walls of the thoracic cage. (i) The first seven pairs are called true ribs because their anterior ends are attached directly to the sternum by means of small pieces of hyaline cartilage, the costal cartilages. (ii) The eighth, ninth and tenth pairs of the ribs are called false ribs. They articulate by cartilage which are attached indirectly to the sternum. They are also called vertebrochondral ribs. (iii) The last two pairs of ribs are called floating ribs because their anterior ends are not attached to either the sternum or the cartilage of another rib.

Why movements of internal organs are essential for animals?,"Movement of internal organs are essential for the animals because: (i) Food and urine are moved forward by the movements of the muscles present in the  digestive and urinary tracts respectively. (ii) Movements of cardiac muscles enables the heart to receive and distribute the blood. (iii) Inspiration and expiration involves the movements of the diaphragm, ribs, etc. (iv) Movements of uterine wall enable the mother to give birth to a child.","You have learnt that all living cells have to be provided with nutrients, O2 and other essential substances. Also, the waste or harmful substances produced, have to be removed continuously for healthy functioning of tissues. It is therefore, essential to have efficient mechanisms for the movement of these substances to the cells and from the cells. Different groups of animals have evolved different methods for this transport. Simple organisms like sponges and coelenterates circulate water from their surroundings through their body cavities to facilitate the cells to exchange these substances. More complex organisms use special fluids within their bodies to transport such materials. Blood is the most commonly used body fluid by most of the higher organisms including humans for this purpose. Another body fluid, lymph, also helps in the transport of certain substances. In this chapter, you will learn about the composition and properties of blood and lymph (tissue fluid) and the mechanism of circulation of blood is also explained herein.

What are antagonistic muscles? Write about any one set of antagonistic muscles.,"Muscles which act in opposition to other muscles are called the antagonistic muscles.

(ii) Extension: This muscle extends or straightens a limb e.g., triceps. It extends the fore arm.","called locomotion. Animals move generally in search of food, shelter, mate, breeding ground, better climate or to protect themselves. The cells of the human body exhibit amoeboid, ciliary and muscular movements. Locomotion and many other movements require coordinated muscular activities. Three types of muscles are present in our body. Skeletal muscles are attached to skeletal elements. They appear striated and are voluntary in nature. Visceral muscles, present in the inner walls of visceral organs are nonstriated and involuntary. Cardiac muscles are the muscles of the heart. They are striated, branched and involuntary. Muscles possess excitability, contractility, extensibility and elasticity. Muscle fibre is the anatomical unit of muscle. Each muscle fibre has many parallelly arranged myofibrils. Each myofibril contains many serially arranged units called sarcomere which are the functional units. Each sarcomere has a central ‘A’ band made of thick myosin filaments, and two half ‘I’ bands made of thin actin filaments on either side of it marked by ‘Z’ lines. Actin and myosin are polymerised proteins with contractility. The active sites for myosin on resting actin filament are masked by a protein-troponin. Myosin head contains ATPase and has ATP binding sites and active sites for actin. A motor neuron carries signal to the muscle fibre which generates an action potential in it. This causes the release of Ca++ from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca++ activates actin which binds to the myosin head to form a cross bridge. These cross bridges pull the actin filaments causing them to slide over the myosin filaments and thereby causing contraction. Ca++ are then returned to sarcoplasmic reticulum which inactivate the actin. Cross bridges are broken and the muscles relax. Repeated stimulation of muscles leads to fatigue. Muscles are classified as Red and White fibres based primarily on the amount of red coloured myoglobin pigment in them. Bones and cartilages constitute our skeletal system. The skeletal system is divisible into axial and appendicular. Skull, vertebral column, ribs and sternum constitute the axial skeleton. Limb bones and girdles form the appendicular skeleton. Three types of joints are formed between bones or between bone and cartilage – fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial. Synovial joints allow considerable movements and therefore, play a significant role in locomotion.
 "
How are thick and thin filaments arranged in a muscle fibre?,"(i) The sarcoplasmic reticulum releases the stored Ca ++ which binds with the specific sites present on the troponin component of the thin filament. (ii) As a result, conformational change occurs in the troponin molecule and the active sites present on the F-actin molecules are exposed. (iii) These sites are specific to myosin head which exhibits Mg ++ dependent ATPase activity. (iv) During the relaxation of the muscle, the Ca ++ is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. (v) As a result the troponin component becomes free to mask the active sites for myosin head. (vi) The cross bridge breaks and thin filament occupies its normal position and muscle relaxes.  ","20.2.1 Structure of Contractile Proteins Each actin (thin) filament is made of two ‘F’ (filamentous) actins helically wound to each other. Each ‘F’ actin is a polymer of monomeric ‘G’ (Globular) actins. Two filaments of another protein, tropomyosin also run close to the ‘F’ actins throughout its length. A complex protein Troponin is distributed at regular intervals on the tropomyosin. In the resting state a subunit of troponin masks the active binding sites for myosin on the actin filaments (Figure 20.3a). Each myosin (thick) filament is also a polymerised protein.

 pulls the attached actin filaments towards the centre of ‘A’ band. The ‘Z’ line attached to these actins are also pulled inwards thereby causing a shortening of the sarcomere, i.e., contraction. It is clear from the above steps, that during shortening of the muscle, i.e., contraction, the ‘I’ bands get reduced, whereas the ‘A’ bands retain the length (Figure 20.5). The myosin, releasing the ADP and P1 goes back to its relaxed state. A new ATP binds and the cross-bridge is broken (Figure 20.4).

Q. 2 Name the hormones of posterior pituitary. Why are these called neurohormones (KVS 2015),Oxytocin and vasopressin are two hormones of posterior pituitary. These hormones are called neurohormones because as they are actually synthesised by the hypothalamus and are transported axonally to neurohypophysis.,"As you know, the hypothalamus is the basal part of diencephalon, forebrain (Figure 22.1) and it regulates a wide spectrum of body functions. It contains Figure 22.1 Location of endocrine glands several groups of neurosecretory cells called nuclei which produce hormones. These hormones regulate the synthesis and secretion of pituitary hormones. However, the hormones produced by hypothalamus are of two types, the releasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary hormones) and the inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of pituitary hormones). For example a hypothalamic hormone called Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates the pituitary synthesis and release of gonadotrophins. On the other hand, somatostatin from the hypothalamus inhibits the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. These hormones originating in the hypothalamic neurons, pass through axons and are released from their nerve endings. These hormones reach the pituitary gland through a portal circulatory system and regulate the functions of the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is under the direct neural regulation of the hypothalamus (Figure 22.2).

(ii) Thyroid hormones control the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats.  (iii) They promote growth of the body tissues.","only one hormone, while pars nervosa (neurohypophysis) secretes two hormones. The pituitary hormones regulate the growth and development of somatic tissues and activities of peripheral endocrine glands. Pineal gland secretes melatonin, which plays a very important role in the regulation of 24-hour (diurnal) rhythms of our body (e.g., rhythms of sleep and state of being awake, body temperature, etc.). The thyroid gland hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basal metabolic rate, development and maturation of the central neural system, erythropoiesis, metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats, menstrual cycle. Another thyroid hormone, i.e., thyrocalcitonin regulates calcium levels in our blood by decreasing it. The parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) which increases the blood Ca2+ levels and plays a major role in calcium homeostasis. The thymus gland secretes thymosins which play a major role in the differentiation of T-lymphocytes, which provide cell-mediated immunity. In addition, thymosins also increase the production of antibodies to provide humoral immunity. The adrenal gland is composed of the centrally located adrenal medulla and the outer adrenal cortex. The adrenal medulla secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones increase alertness, pupilary dilation, piloerection, sweating, heart beat, strength of heart contraction, rate of respiration, glycogenolysis, lipolysis, proteolysis. The adrenal cortex secretes glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, proteolysis, erythropoiesis, cardio-vascular system, blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate and inhibit inflammatory reactions by suppressing the immune response. Mineralocorticoids regulate water and electrolyte contents of the body. The endocrine pancreas secretes glucagon and insulin. Glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis resulting in hyperglycemia. Insulin stimulates cellular glucose uptake and utilisation, and glycogenesis resulting in hypoglycemia. Insulin deficiency and/or insulin resistance result in a disease called diabetes mellitus. The testis secretes androgens, which stimulate the development, maturation and functions of the male accessory sex organs, appearance of the male secondary sex characters, spermatogenesis, male sexual behaviour, anabolic pathways and erythropoiesis. The ovary secretes estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen stimulates growth and development of female accessory sex organs and secondary sex characters. Progesterone plays a major role in the maintenance of pregnancy as well as in mammary gland development and lactation. The atrial wall of the heart produces atrial natriuretic factor which decreases the blood pressure. Kidney produces erythropoietin which stimulates erythropoiesis. The gastrointestinal tract secretes gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin and gastric inhibitory peptide. These hormones regulate the secretion of digestive juices and help in digestion.

MSH acts on the melanocytes (melanin containing cells) and regulates pigmentation of the skin. Oxytocin acts on the smooth muscles of our body and stimulates their contraction. In females, it stimulates a vigorous contraction of uterus at the time of child birth, and milk ejection from the mammary gland. Vasopressin acts mainly at the kidney and stimulates resorption of water and electrolytes by the distal tubules and thereby reduces loss of water through urine (diuresis). Hence, it is also called as anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). An impairment affecting synthesis or release of ADH results in a diminished ability of the kidney to conserve water leading to water loss and dehydration. This condition is known as Diabetes Insipidus.

What hormones are secreted by the posterior pituitary gland ? What function does each serve? Where are these hormones actually produced ? How are these hormones transported to the region from which they are released ?,"(i) Oxytocin : It is released into the blood when hypothalamic neurons are stimulated by the widening of uterus at the time of delivery or by the sucking of breasts by an infant. It induces contraction of smooth muscles of the uterus during the birth of a young one and myoepithelial cells of mammary glands to cause release of milk during sucking by an infant. Therefore, it is also known as ‘birth hormones’ and or ‘milk-ejecting hormones’. (ii) Vasopressin : It is also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH).

The bile duct and the pancreatic duct open together into the duodenum as the common hepato-pancreatic duct which is guarded by a sphincter called the sphincter of Oddi. The pancreas is a compound (both exocrine and endocrine) elongated organ situated between the limbs of the ‘C’ shaped duodenum. The exocrine portion secretes an alkaline pancreatic juice containing enzymes and the endocrine portion secretes hormones, insulin and glucagon.

 22.1 ENDOCRINE GLANDS AND HORMONES Endocrine glands lack ducts and are hence, called ductless glands. Their secretions are called hormones. The classical definition of hormone as a chemical produced by endocrine glands and released into the blood and transported to a distantly located target organ has current scientific definition as follows: Hormones are non-nutrient chemicals which act as intercellular messengers and are produced in trace amounts. The new definition covers a number of new molecules in addition to the hormones secreted by the organised endocrine glands. Invertebrates possess very simple endocrine systems with few hormones whereas a large number of chemicals act as hormones and provide coordination in the vertebrates. The human endocrine system is described here.

What is the importance of Glucocorticoids in man?,"(i) Glucocorticoids hormones are secreted by the middle region of the adrenal cortex. (ii) They regulate the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. They increase the blood glucose level by converting proteins and fats into carbohydrates which are in turn converted to glucose. (iii) In case of excessive bleeding, glucocorticoids constrict blood vessels to offset the drop in blood pressure due to blood lose. (iv) They have anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects.","an increased concentration of glucose in blood. In addition, they also stimulate the breakdown of lipids and proteins. The adrenal cortex can be divided into three layers, called zona reticularis (inner layer), zona fasciculata (middle layer) and zona glomerulosa (outer layer). The adrenal cortex secretes many hormones, commonly called as corticoids. The corticoids, which are involved in carbohydrate metabolism are called glucocorticoids. In our body, cortisol is the main glucocorticoid. Corticoids, which regulate the balance of water and electrolytes in our body are called mineralocorticoids. Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid in our body. Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and proteolysis; and inhibit cellular uptake and utilisation of amino acids. Cortisol is also involved in maintaining the cardio-vascular system as well as the kidney functions. Glucocorticoids, particularly cortisol, produces antiinflammatory reactions and suppresses the immune response. Cortisol stimulates the RBC production. Aldosterone acts mainly at the renal tubules and stimulates the reabsorption of Na+ and water and excretion of K+ and phosphate ions. Thus, aldosterone helps in the maintenance of electrolytes, body fluid volume, osmotic pressure and blood pressure. Small amounts of androgenic steroids are also secreted by the adrenal cortex which play a role in the growth of axial hair, pubic hair and facial hair during puberty.

Differentiate between hormones and pheromones.,"(i) The disease is diabetes mellitus. (ii) The failure of the ß-cells of the islets of Langerhans of pancreas to produce adequate amounts of insulin is the root cause of this disease.  (iii) Undersecretion of insulin impairs of the following functions : Utilisation and uptake of glucose by adipocytes and hepatocytes, conversion of glucose into glycogen by the above target cells.","uptake and utilisation. As a result, there is a rapid movement of glucose from blood to hepatocytes and adipocytes resulting in decreased blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia). Insulin also stimulates conversion of glucose to glycogen (glycogenesis) in the target cells. The glucose homeostasis in blood is thus maintained jointly by the two – insulin and glucagons. Prolonged hyperglycemia leads to a complex disorder called diabetes mellitus which is associated with loss of glucose through urine and formation of harmful compounds known as ketone bodies. Diabetic patients are successfully treated with insulin therapy.

"Explain the hormones of (i) Heart, (ii) Kidney and (iii) GI Tract.","The hormones of the Heart, Kidney and Gastrointestinal Tract are: (i) Heart/Atrium : Atrial wall of human heart produces important peptide hormone called atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). ANF reduces blood pressure. When the blood pressure is enhanced, some special c ells secrete ANF, that produces vasodilatory actions on the blood pressure. The blood vessels are dilated and blood pressure declines as a result. (ii) Kidney : Juxtaglomerular cells of kidney secrete a peptide hormone called erythropoietin. It stimulates erythropoiesis or formation of RBCs of blood. (iii) GI Tract : The endocrine cells found in various parts of gastro-intestinal tract (GI tract) secrete four peptide hormones gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin (CCK) as well as gastric inhibitory peptide or GIP. (a) Gastrin : It acts on gastric glands. It stimulates secretion of hydrochloric acid (HCI) and pepsinogen. (b) Secretin : It acts on the exocrine pancreas. It stimulates secretion of water and bicarbonate ions. (c) CCK : It acts on both pancreas and gall bladder. It stimulates the secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile juice respectively. (d) GIP: It suppresses gastric secretion and motility.","22.3 HORMONES OF HEART, KIDNEY AND GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT Now you know about the endocrine glands and their hormones. However, as mentioned earlier, hormones are also secreted by some tissues which are not endocrine glands. For example, the atrial wall of our heart secretes a very important peptide hormone called atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), which decreases blood pressure. When blood pressure is increased, ANF is secreted which causes dilation of the blood vessels. This reduces the blood pressure. The juxtaglomerular cells of kidney produce a peptide hormone called erythropoietin which stimulates erythropoiesis (formation of RBC). Endocrine cells present in different parts of the gastro-intestinal tract secrete four major peptide hormones, namely gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). Gastrin acts on the gastric glands and stimulates the secretion of hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen. Secretin acts on the exocrine pancreas and stimulates secretion of water and bicarbonate ions. CCK acts on both pancreas and gall bladder and stimulates the secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile juice, respectively. GIP inhibits gastric secretion and motility. Several other non-endocrine tissues secrete hormones called growth factors. These factors are essential for the normal growth of tissues and their repairing/regeneration.

Where is the parathyroid gland located ? Name its secretion. How is its secretion regulated. Mention one parathyroid disorder.,"(i) The parathyroid glands consist of four separate glands located on the posterior surface of the lobes of the thyroid gland, one pair each in the two lobes. (ii) The parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone or parathormone, the secretion of which is regulated by the circulating calcium ion. (iii) Hypoparathyroidism causes the lowering of blood calcium level thereby leading to parathyroid tetany.","Thyroid Gland
 The thyroid gland is composed of two lobes which are located on either side of the trachea (Figure 22.3). Both the lobes are interconnected with a thin flap of connective tissue called isthmus. The thyroid gland is composed of follicles and stromal tissues. Each thyroid follicle is composed of follicular cells, enclosing a cavity. These follicular cells synthesise two hormones, tetraiodothyronine or thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Iodine is essential for the normal rate of hormone synthesis in the thyroid. Deficiency of Figure 22.3 Diagrammatic view of the iodine in our diet results in hypothyroidism and position of Thyroid and enlargement of the thyroid gland, commonly called Parathyroid (a) Ventral side goitre. Hypothyroidism during pregnancy causes (b) Dorsal side defective development and maturation of the growing
 Parathyroid Gland
 In humans, four parathyroid glands are present on the back side of the thyroid gland, one pair each in the two lobes of the thyroid gland (Figure 22.3b). The parathyroid glands secrete a peptide hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH). The secretion of PTH is regulated by the circulating levels of calcium ions. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases the Ca2+ levels in the blood. PTH acts on bones and stimulates the process of bone resorption (dissolution/ demineralisation). PTH also stimulates reabsorption of Ca2+ by the renal tubules and increases Ca2+ absorption from the digested food. It is, thus, clear that PTH is a hypercalcemic hormone, i.e., it increases the blood Ca2+ levels. Along with TCT, it plays a significant role in calcium balance in the body.

How does Parathyroid hormone helps in the feedback control of calcium level in blood ?,"(i) Parathyroid hormones are under the feedback control of blood calcium level. (ii) A fall in blood calcium level stimulates them to secrete parathormone which restores blood calcium level. (iii) It increases blood calcium by drawing calcium from the bones into the plasma, by increasing calcium absorption in the digestive tract, and by reducing loss of calcium in the urine.

What is a joint? Briefly describe the types of joints. ,"The structural arrangements of tissues by which bones are joined together are called joints. There are three types of joints: (i) Fibrous or immovable joints: There is no movement in such joints. There is white fibrous tissue between the ends of the bones. e.g., the joints of skull, teeth etc. (ii) Cartilaginous or slightly movable joints: It is an articulation between bones in which motion is limited due to either fibrous tissue or cartilage. (iii) Synovial or freely movable joints: It is a freely movable joint characterized by the presence of a fluid filled synovial cavity between the articulating surfaces of the two bone.","this. Joints are points of contact between bones, or between bones and cartilages. Force generated by the muscles is used to carry out movement through joints, where the joint acts as a fulcrum. The movability at these joints vary depending on different factors. Joints have been classified into three major structural forms, namely, fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial. Fibrous joints do not allow any movement. This type of joint is shown by the flat skull bones which fuse end-to-end with the help of dense fibrous connective tissues in the form of sutures, to form the cranium. In cartilaginous joints, the bones involved are joined together with the help of cartilages. The joint between the adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column is of this pattern and it permits limited movements. Synovial joints are characterised by the presence of a fluid filled synovial cavity between the articulating surfaces of the two bones. Such an arragement allows considerable movement. These joints help in locomotion and many other movements. Ball and socket joint (between humerus and pectoral girdle), hinge joint (knee joint), pivot joint (between atlas and axis), gliding joint (between the carpals) and saddle joint (between carpal and metacarpal of thumb) are some examples.
 bones and blood are various types of specialised connective tissues. The intercellular material of cartilage is solid and pliable and resists compression. Cells of this tissue (chondrocytes) are enclosed in small cavities within the matrix secreted by them (Figure 7.6a). Most of the cartilages in vertebrate embryos are replaced by bones in adults. Cartilage is present in the tip of nose, outer ear joints, between adjacent bones of the vertebral column, limbs and hands in adults. Bones have a hard and non-pliable ground substance rich in calcium salts and collagen fibres which give bone its strength (Figure 7.6b). It is the main tissue that provides structural frame to the body. Bones support and protect softer tissues and organs. The bone cells (osteocytes) are present in the spaces called lacunae. Limb bones, such as the long bones of the legs, serve weight-bearing functions. They also interact with skeletal muscles attached to them to bring about movements. The bone marrow in some bones is the site of production of blood cells. Blood is a fluid connective tissue containing plasma, red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC) and platelets (Figure 7.6c). It is the main circulating fluid that helps in the transport of various substances. You will learn more about blood in Chapters 17 and 18.
 7.1.3 Muscle Tissue Each muscle is made of many long, cylindrical fibres arranged in parallel arrays. These fibres are composed of numerous fine fibrils, called myofibrils. Muscle fibres contract (shorten) in response to stimulation, then relax (lengthen) and return to their uncontracted state in a coordinated fashion. Their action moves the body to adjust to the changes in the environment and to maintain the positions of the various parts of the body. In general, muscles play an active role in all the movements of the body. Muscles are of three types, skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. Skeletal muscle tissue is closely attached to skeletal bones. In a typical muscle such as the biceps, striated (striped) skeletal muscle fibres are bundled together in a parallel fashion (Figure 7.7a). A sheath of tough connective tissue encloses several bundles of muscle fibres (You will learn more about this in Chapter 20).
 "
What is muscle fatigue? How does it cause?,"The reduction in the force of contraction of a muscle after prolonged stimulation is called muscle fatigue. (i) A muscle is able to contract for a short time in the absence of oxygen. But it gets fatigue sooner because the metabolic products of glycolysis mainly lactic acid accumulate, in the absence of oxygen. (ii) The accumulation of lactic acid leads to muscle fatigue.","and breakage is repeated causing further sliding. The process continues till the Ca++ ions are pumped back to the sarcoplasmic cisternae resulting in the masking of actin filaments. This causes the return of ‘Z’ lines back to their original position, i.e., relaxation. The reaction time of the fibres can vary in different muscles. Repeated activation of the muscles can lead to the accumulation of lactic acid due to anaerobic breakdown of glycogen in them, causing fatigue. Muscle contains a red coloured oxygen storing pigment called myoglobin. Myoglobin content is high in some of the muscles which gives a reddish appearance. Such muscles are called the Red fibres. These muscles also contain plenty of mitochondria which can utilise the large amount of oxygen stored in them for ATP production. These muscles, therefore, can also be called aerobic muscles. On the other hand, some of the muscles possess very less quantity of myoglobin and therefore, appear pale or whitish. These are the White fibres. Number of mitochondria are also few in them, but the amount of sarcoplasmic reticulum is high. They depend on anaerobic process for energy.
 "
Describe the structure of synovial joint.,"(i) There is a membrane present called synovial membrane. (ii) This membrane is composed of secretory epithelial cells which secrete a thick sticky fluid, of the consistency of the white of an egg called synovial fluid. (iii) It acts as a lubricant to the joint, provides nutrient materials for the structures within the joint cavity and helps to maintain the stability of the joint.  (iv) Bone ends are covered by articular cartilages. (v) Ligaments join the bones and tendons connect the bones with muscles. (vi) Little sacs of synovial fluid or bursae are found in some joints.  ","this. Joints are points of contact between bones, or between bones and cartilages. Force generated by the muscles is used to carry out movement through joints, where the joint acts as a fulcrum.

What are uricotelic animals? Give two examples. ,"Uricotelic animals: Animals which excrete urea as nitrogenous waste are called uricotelic animals and the process is called uricotelism. E.g. Frog, man.","Animals accumulate ammonia, urea, uric acid, carbon dioxide, water and ions like Na+, K+, Cl–, phosphate, sulphate, etc., either by metabolic activities or by other means like excess ingestion. These substances have to be removed totally or partially. In this chapter, you will learn the mechanisms of elimination of these substances with special emphasis on common nitrogenous wastes. Ammonia, urea and uric acid are the major forms of nitrogenous wastes excreted by the animals. Ammonia is the most toxic form and requires large amount of water for its elimination, whereas uric acid, being the least toxic, can be removed with a minimum loss of water. The process of excreting ammonia is Ammonotelism. Many bony fishes, aquatic amphibians and aquatic insects are ammonotelic in nature. Ammonia, as it is readily soluble, is generally excreted by diffusion across body surfaces or through gill surfaces (in fish) as ammonium ions. Kidneys do not play any significant role in its removal. Terrestrial adaptation necessitated the production of lesser toxic nitrogenous wastes like urea and uric acid for conservation of water. Mammals, many terrestrial amphibians and marine fishes mainly excrete urea and are called ureotelic animals. Ammonia produced by metabolism is converted into urea in the liver of these animals and released into the blood which is filtered and excreted out by the kidneys. Some amount of urea may be retained in the kidney matrix of some of these animals to maintain a desired osmolarity. Reptiles, birds, land snails and insects excrete nitrogenous wastes as uric acid in the form of pellet or paste with a minimum loss of water and are called uricotelic animals.
 "
Mention four aspects in which uricotelism differs from ureotelism.,The four aspects in which uricotelism differs from ureotelism are: (i) Uricotelism is excretion of uric acid whereas ureotelism is excretion of urea. (ii) Uric acid is non-toxic whereas urea is less toxic. (iii) Uric acid is insoluble in water whereas urea is soluble in water. (iv) Uric acid can be excreted out in the form of crystals but urea does not form crystals.,"(d) Uricotelism

Differentiate between peritubular capillaries and vasa recta?,The fine capillary network around the renal tubule formed by the efferent arteriole emerging from the glomerulus are called peritubular capillaries. The U-shaped peritubular capillary that runs parallel to the henle's loop is called vasa recta.,"(PCT). A hairpin shaped Henle’s loop is the Afferent arteriole next part of the tubule which has a descending and an ascending limb. The Efferent ascending limb continues as another highly arteriole coiled tubular region called distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The DCTs of many Bowman’s capsule nephrons open into a straight tube called collecting duct, many of which converge and open into the renal pelvis through medullary pyramids in the calyces. The Malpighian corpuscle, PCT and DCT of the nephron are situated in the cortical region of the kidney whereas the loop of Henle dips into the medulla. In majority of nephrons, the loop of Henle is too short and Proximal extends only very little into the medulla. Such convoluted tubule nephrons are called cortical nephrons. In some of the nephrons, the loop of Henle is Figure 19.4 Malpighian body (renal corpuscle) very long and runs deep into the medulla. These nephrons are called juxta medullary nephrons. The efferent arteriole emerging from the glomerulus forms a fine capillary network around the renal tubule called the peritubular capillaries. A minute vessel of this network runs parallel to the Henle’s loop forming a ‘U’ shaped vasa recta. Vasa recta is absent or highly reduced in cortical nephrons.
 "
State the role of blood capillaries associated with the nephrons in kidney.,"The role of blood capillaries associated with the nephrons are: (i) To bring blood capillaries under pressure by afferent arteriole. (ii) Formation of glomerulus in Bowman's capsule. (iii) Formation of network of capillaries around the nephrons. (iv) Selective reabsorption of water, glucose, salts, vitamins and other necessary things.","medullary pyramids as renal columns called Columns of Bertini (Figure 19.2). Each kidney has nearly one million complex tubular structures called nephrons (Figure 19.3), which are the functional units. Each nephron has two parts – the glomerulus and the renal tubule. Glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries formed by the afferent arteriole – a fine branch of renal artery. Blood from the glomerulus is carried away by an efferent arteriole. The renal tubule begins with a double walled cup-like structure called Bowman’s capsule, which encloses the glomerulus. Glomerulus alongwith Bowman’s capsule, is called the malpighian body or renal corpuscle (Figure 19.4). The tubule continues further to form a highly coiled network – proximal convoluted tubule

 "
What is urine? Give the composition of urine.,"Urine is a pale yellow coloured and transparent fluid. (i) The pale yellow colour is due to pigment urochrome produced by the breakdown of haemoglobin from worn out RBCs. (ii) Normal urine contains about 95% water, 2% electrolytes (ions of salts, mainly chlorides, sulphates, bicarbonates of sodium, potassium etc.), 2.6% urea, 0.3% uric acid and traces of creatinine, ammonia, some pigments, hormones, allantoin and hippuric acid.","to initiate the contraction of smooth muscles of the bladder and simultaneous relaxation of the urethral sphincter causing the release of urine. The process of release of urine is called micturition and the neural mechanisms causing it is called the micturition reflex. An adult human excretes, on an average, 1 to 1.5 litres of urine per day. The urine formed is a light yellow coloured watery fluid which is slightly acidic (pH-6.0) and has a characterestic odour. On an average, 25-30 gm of urea is excreted out per day. Various conditions can affect the characteristics of urine. Analysis of urine helps in clinical diagnosis of many metabolic discorders as well as malfunctioning of the kidney. For example, presence of glucose (Glycosuria) and ketone bodies (Ketonuria) in urine are indicative of diabetes mellitus.
 "
Explain the structure and the function of vasa rectae. What is vasa rectae? What is their role? ,"(i) The capillaries around the loop of Henle are called vasa rectae. (ii) The vasa recta helps to retain reabsorbed ions and urea in the interstitial fluid of the medulla. Thus, high osmotic pressure is maintained. ","also in a counter current pattern. The proximity between the Henle’s loop and vasa recta, as well as the counter current in them help in maintaining an increasing osmolarity towards the inner medullary interstitium, i.e., from 300 mOsmolL–1 in the cortex to about 1200 mOsmolL–1 in the inner medulla. This gradient is mainly caused by NaCl and urea. NaCl is transported by the ascending limb of Henle’s loop which is exchanged with the descending limb of vasa recta. NaCl is returned to the interstitium by the ascending portion of vasa recta. Similarly, small amounts of urea enter the thin segment of the ascending limb of Henle’s loop which is transported back to the interstitium by the collecting tubule. The above described transport of substances facilitated by the special arrangement of Henle’s loop and vasa recta is called the counter current mechanism (Figure. 19.6). This mechanism helps to maintain a concentration gradient
 "
What is the role of collecting duct in selective reabsorption?,(i) The cuboidal epithelial cells of collecting tubule are permeable to water but not to salt. This allows the reabsorption of large amounts of water which results in the formation of concentrated urine. (ii) It also plays a role in the maintenance of pH and ionic balance of blood by the selective secretion of H + and K+ ions.,"in the medullary interstitium. Presence of such interstitial gradient helps in an easy passage of water from the collecting tubule thereby concentrating the filtrate (urine). Human kidneys can produce urine nearly four times concentrated than the initial filtrate formed.
 "
What is ADH? What are its functions?,"Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is one of the hormones that efficiently monitors and regulates the functioning of the kidneys. Antidiuretic hormone released from the posterior pituitary, prevents wide swings in water balance, helping to avoid dehydration or water overload. ADH facilitates reabsorption of water by the distal parts of the kidney tubules and thereby prevents diuresis.","The functioning of the kidneys is efficiently monitored and regulated by hormonal feedback mechanisms involving the hypothalamus, JGA and to a certain extent, the heart. Osmoreceptors in the body are activated by changes in blood volume, body fluid volume and ionic concentration. An excessive loss of fluid from the body can activate these receptors which stimulate the hypothalamus to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin from the neurohypophysis. ADH facilitates water reabsorption from latter parts of the tubule, thereby preventing diuresis. An increase in body fluid volume can switch off the osmoreceptors and suppress the ADH release to complete the feedback. ADH can also affect the kidney function by its constrictory effects on blood vessels. This causes an increase in blood pressure. An increase in blood pressure can increase the glomerular blood flow and thereby the GFR. The JGA plays a complex regulatory role. A fall in glomerular blood flow/glomerular blood pressure/GFR can activate the JG cells to release renin which converts angiotensinogen in blood to angiotensin I and further to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, being a powerful vasoconstrictor, increases the glomerular blood pressure and thereby GFR. Angiotensin II also activates the adrenal cortex to release Aldosterone. Aldosterone causes reabsorption of Na+ and water from the distal parts of the tubule. This also leads to an increase in blood pressure and GFR. This complex mechanism is generally known as the Renin-Angiotensin mechanism. An increase in blood flow to the atria of the heart can cause the release of Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF). ANF can cause vasodilation (dilation of blood vessels) and thereby decrease the blood pressure. ANF mechanism, therefore, acts as a check on the renin-angiotensin mechanism.

How diabetes insipidus is different from diabetes mellitus?,"Deficiency of ADH leads to diabetes insipidus, a condition marked by the output of huge amounts of urine and intense thirst. The name itself (diabetes = overflow; insipidus tasteless) distinguishes it from diabetes mellitus (mel = honey), in which insulin deficiency causes large amounts of blood sugar to be lost in the urine.","Which hormonal deficiency is responsible for the following: (a) Diabetes mellitus

What do you mean by artificial kidney?,Hemodialysis is an artificial process of removing toxic substances from the blood in patients of kidney failure. The hemodialysis machine is therefore also known as the artificial kidney.,"19.8 DISORDERS OF THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM Malfunctioning of kidneys can lead to accumulation of urea in blood, a condition called uremia, which is highly harmful and may lead to kidney failure. In such patients, urea can be removed by a process called hemodialysis. During the process of haemodialysis, the blood drained from a convenient artery is pumped into a dialysing unit called artificial kidney. Blood drained from a convenient artery is pumped into a dialysing unit after adding an anticoagulant like heparin. The unit contains a coiled cellophane tube surrounded by a fluid (dialysing fluid) having the same
 "
Why is ADH so called?,"ADH facilitates reabsorption of water by the distal parts of the kidney tubules and thereby prevents diuresis. Also, it prevents wide swings in water balance, helping to avoid dehydration or water overload. That is why it is called Antidiuretic hormone (ADH).  ","The functioning of the kidneys is efficiently monitored and regulated by hormonal feedback mechanisms involving the hypothalamus, JGA and to a certain extent, the heart. Osmoreceptors in the body are activated by changes in blood volume, body fluid volume and ionic concentration. An excessive loss of fluid from the body can activate these receptors which stimulate the hypothalamus to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin from the neurohypophysis. ADH facilitates water reabsorption from latter parts of the tubule, thereby preventing diuresis. An increase in body fluid volume can switch off the osmoreceptors and suppress the ADH release to complete the feedback. ADH can also affect the kidney function by its constrictory effects on blood vessels. This causes an increase in blood pressure. An increase in blood pressure can increase the glomerular blood flow and thereby the GFR. The JGA plays a complex regulatory role. A fall in glomerular blood flow/glomerular blood pressure/GFR can activate the JG cells to release renin which converts angiotensinogen in blood to angiotensin I and further to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, being a powerful vasoconstrictor, increases the glomerular blood pressure and thereby GFR. Angiotensin II also activates the adrenal cortex to release Aldosterone. Aldosterone causes reabsorption of Na+ and water from the distal parts of the tubule. This also leads to an increase in blood pressure and GFR. This complex mechanism is generally known as the Renin-Angiotensin mechanism. An increase in blood flow to the atria of the heart can cause the release of Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF). ANF can cause vasodilation (dilation of blood vessels) and thereby decrease the blood pressure. ANF mechanism, therefore, acts as a check on the renin-angiotensin mechanism.

Describe briefly the experiment conducted by T.W. Engelmann.,Engelmann split light into its spectral components by the prism and then illuminated 𝐶𝑙𝑎𝑑𝑜𝑝ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑎 (a green alga) placed in a suspension of aerobic bacteria. He found that bacteria accumulated in the region of blue and red light of the split spectrum. He thus discovered the effect of different wavelengths of light on photosynthesis and plotted the first action spectrum of photosynthesis.,"It was not until about 1854 that Julius von Sachs provided evidence for production of glucose when plants grow. Glucose is usually stored as starch. His later studies showed that the green substance in plants (chlorophyll as we know it now) is located in special bodies (later called chloroplasts) within plant cells. He found that the green parts in plants is where glucose is made, and that the glucose is usually stored as starch. Now consider the interesting experiments done by T.W Engelmann (1843 – 1909). Using a prism he split light into its spectral components and then illuminated a green alga, Cladophora, placed in a suspension of aerobic bacteria. The bacteria were used to detect the sites of O2 evolution. He observed that the bacteria accumulated mainly in the region of blue and red light of the split spectrum. A first action spectrum of photosynthesis was thus described. It resembles roughly the absorption spectra of chlorophyll a and b (discussed in section 13.4). By the middle of the nineteenth century the key features of plant photosynthesis were known, namely, that plants could use light energy to make carbohydrates from CO2 and water. The empirical equation representing the total process of photosynthesis for oxygen evolving organisms was then understood as: Light CO2 + H2 O  → [CH2 O] + O2
 where [CH2O] represented a carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, a six-carbon sugar). A milestone contribution to the understanding of photosynthesis was that made by a microbiologist, Cornelius van Niel (1897-1985), who, based on his studies of purple and green bacteria, demonstrated that photosynthesis is essentially a light-dependent reaction in which hydrogen from a suitable oxidisable compound reduces carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. This can be expressed by: Light 2H2 A + CO2  → 2 A + CH2 O + H2 O

Why does chlorophyll appear green in reflected light and red in transmitted light ? Explain the significance of these phenomenon in terms of photosynthesis.,"In reflected light, the chlorophyll appears red because of fluorescence. The light absorbed by chlorophyll molecules loses its energy and emits wavelengths corresponds to red colour. In transmitted light, chlorophyll appears green because it absorbs only light of wavelengths correspond to green colour.","Looking at plants have you ever wondered why and how there are so many shades of green in their leaves – even in the same plant? We can look for an answer to this question by trying to separate the leaf pigments of any green plant through paper chromatography. A chromatographic separation of the leaf pigments shows that the colour that we see in leaves is not due to a single pigment but due to four pigments: Chlorophyll a (bright or blue green in the chromatogram), chlorophyll b (yellow green), xanthophylls (yellow) and carotenoids (yellow to yellow-orange). Let us now see what roles various pigments play in photosynthesis. Pigments are substances that have an ability to absorb light, at specific wavelengths. Can you guess which is the most abundant plant pigment in the world? Let us study the graph showing the ability of chlorophyll a pigment to absorb lights of different wavelengths (Figure 13.3 a). Of course, you are familiar with the wavelength of the visible spectrum of light as well as the VIBGYOR. From Figure 13.3a can you determine the wavelength (colour of light) at which chlorophyll a shows the maximum absorption? Does it show another absorption peak at any other wavelengths too? If yes, which one? Now look at Figure 13.3b showing the wavelengths at which maximum photosynthesis occurs in a plant. Can you see that the wavelengths at which there is maximum absorption by chlorophyll a, i.e., in the blue and the red regions, also shows higher rate of photosynthesis. Hence, we can conclude that chlorophyll a is the chief pigment associated with photosynthesis. But by looking at Figure 13.3c can you say that there is a complete one-to-one overlap between the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a and the action spectrum of photosynthesis?

Explain the following:    (i) There will be no life without photosynthesis. (ii) There is no oxygen evolution in bacterial photosynthesis. (iii) Chlorophyll a is an essential photosynthetic pigment.,"(i) For existence of life, food and O2 are very essential. Photosynthesis is the only process which can trap solar energy and can synthesis food for own and all other organisms. During photosynthesis, O2 is given out and CO2 is taken. So, it keeps balance of O2 and CO2 in nature. Thus, photosynthesis is essential for existence of life. (ii) In bacterial photosynthesis, the raw material of the supply of proton (H +) is H2 S. than H2 O. Thus, there is production of Sulphur and not oxygen. (iii) Chlorophyll-b and other pigments of a reaction centre or photosystem absorb solar energy and transfer it to chlorophyll-a. Ultimately it is the chlorophylI-a that initiates the photosynthesis process. ","where [CH2O] represented a carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, a six-carbon sugar).

When H2S, instead is the hydrogen donor for purple and green sulphur bacteria, the ‘oxidation’ product is sulphur or sulphate depending on the organism and not O2. Hence, he inferred that the O2 evolved by the green plant comes from H2O, not from carbon dioxide. This was later proved by using radioisotopic techniques. The correct equation, that would represent the overall process of photosynthesis is therefore: Light 6CO2 + 12H2 O  → C6 H12 O6 + 6H2 O + 6O2

What is difference between cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation ? , (i)  (ii)  (iii)  Cyclic photophosphorylation It is a process of photophosphory- lation in which an electron expelled by the excited photo- centre is returned to it after passing through a series of electron carriers It is performed by photosystem I (PSI) only. It synthesises only ATP.  Non-cyclic photophosphorylation It is a normal process of photo phosphorylation in which the electron expelled by the excited photocentre does not return to it. It is carried out in collaboration of both photosystem I and II. Non-cyclic Photophosphorylation is not only connected with ATP synthesis but also production of NADPH. ,"ATP is synthesised by cells (in mitochondria and Photosystem I chloroplasts) is named phosphorylation. Photophosphorylation is the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate in the presence of e - acceptor light. When the two photosystems work in a Light series, first PS II and then the PS I, a process called non-cyclic photo-phosphorylation occurs. The two photosystems are connected through an Electron electron transport chain, as seen earlier – in the transport system Z scheme. Both ATP and NADPH + H + are synthesised by this kind of electron flow (Figure 13.5). When only PS I is functional, the electron is Chlorophyll P 700 circulated within the photosystem and the phosphorylation occurs due to cyclic flow of Figure 13.6 Cyclic photophosphorylation electrons (Figure 13.6). A possible location where this could be happening is in the stroma lamellae. While the membrane or lamellae of the grana have both PS I and PS II the stroma lamellae membranes lack PS II as well as NADP reductase enzyme. The excited electron does not pass on to NADP+ but is cycled back to the PS I complex through the electron transport chain (Figure 13.6). The cyclic flow hence, results only in the synthesis of ATP, but not of NADPH + H+. Cyclic photophosphorylation also occurs when only light of wavelengths beyond 680 nm are available for excitation.
 "
What is non-cyclic photophosphorylation ? Describe the process. Why is the process referred to as non-cyclic ? ,Non-cyclic photophosphorylation is the process in which electrons emitted from P680 molecule does not return to it but another electron comes from photolysis of water. It involves both PS I and PS II.,"system consisting of cytochromes (Figure 13.5). This movement of electrons is downhill, in terms of an oxidation-reduction or redox NADPH potential scale. The electrons are not used up e- acceptor Light e- acceptor as they pass through the electron transport NADP + ATP ADP+iP chain, but are passed on to the pigments of photosystem PS I. Simultaneously, electrons Electron transport in the reaction centre of PS I are also excited system when they receive red light of wavelength 700 nm and are transferred to another accepter molecule that has a greater redox potential. LHC These electrons then are moved downhill again, this time to a molecule of energy-rich NADP+. The addition of these electrons reduces LHC 2e- + 2H+ + [O] H 2O NADP+ to NADPH + H+. This whole scheme of transfer of electrons, starting from the PS II, uphill to the acceptor, down the electron Figure 13.5 Z scheme of light reaction transport chain to PS I, excitation of electrons, transfer to another acceptor, and finally down hill to NADP+ reducing it to NADPH + H+ is called the Z scheme, due to its characterstic shape (Figure 13.5). This shape is formed when all the carriers are placed in a sequence on a redox potential scale. Photosystem II

 13.6.1 Splitting of Water You would then ask, How does PS II supply electrons continuously? The electrons that were moved from photosystem II must be replaced. This is achieved by electrons available due to splitting of water. The splitting of water is associated with the PS II; water is split into 2H+, [O] and electrons. This creates oxygen, one of the net products of photosynthesis. The electrons needed to replace those removed from photosystem I are provided by photosystem II.

Certain plants growing in tropical region suffer from photorespiratory loss. How do they overcome it? Mention the anatomical adaptation. Mention the first stable CO2 fixation product and the enzyme responsible for it.  ,"Plants like sugarcane, maize shows C4 pathway for the CO2 fixation during the photosynthesis to oercome the problem of photorespiration which is energy consuming process. These plants have kranz anatomy. In kranz anatomy, the mesophyll is undifferentiated and its cells occur in concentric layers around vascular bundles. Vascular bundles are surrounded by large sized bundle sheath cells. The choloroplast of mesophyll cells are smaller and perform light reaction of photosynthesis and also possess PEPcase for the CO2 fixation. The first stable product of C4 pathway is oxalo-acetic acid. The enzyme responsible for the fixation of atmospheric CO2 is PEP Carboxylase (Phosphoenol Pyruvate Carboxylase).","SUMMARY Green plants make their own food by photosynthesis. During this process carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is taken in by leaves through stomata and used for making carbohydrates, principally glucose and starch. Photosynthesis takes place only in the green parts of the plants, mainly the leaves. Within the leaves, the mesophyll cells have a large number of chloroplasts that are responsible for CO2 fixation. Within the chloroplasts, the membranes are sites for the light reaction, while the chemosynthetic pathway occurs in the stroma. Photosynthesis has two stages: the light reaction and the carbon fixing reactions. In the light reaction the light energy is absorbed by the pigments present in the antenna, and funnelled to special chlorophyll a molecules called reaction centre chlorophylls. There are two photosystems, PS I and PS II. PS I has a 700 nm absorbing chlorophyll a P700 molecule at its reaction centre, while PS II has a P680 reaction centre that absorbs red light at 680 nm. After absorbing light, electrons are excited and transferred through PS II and PS I and finally to NAD forming NADH. During this process a proton gradient is created across the membrane of the thylakoid. The breakdown of the protons gradient due to movement through the F0 part of the ATPase enzyme releases enough energy for synthesis of ATP. Splitting of water molecules is associated with PS II resulting in the release of O2, protons and transfer of electrons to PS II. In the carbon fixation cycle, CO2 is added by the enzyme, RuBisCO, to a 5carbon compound RuBP that is converted to 2 molecules of 3-carbon PGA. This is then converted to sugar by the Calvin cycle, and the RuBP is regenerated. During this process ATP and NADPH synthesised in the light reaction are utilised. RuBisCO also catalyses a wasteful oxygenation reaction in C3 plants: photorespiration. Some tropical plants show a special type of photosynthesis called C4 pathway. In these plants the first product of CO2 fixation that takes place in the mesophyll, is a 4-carbon compound. In the bundle sheath cells the Calvin pathway is carried out for the synthesis of carbohydrates.

This pathway that has been named the Hatch and Slack Pathway, is again a cyclic process. Let us study the pathway by listing the steps. The primary CO2 acceptor is a 3-carbon molecule phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) and is present in the mesophyll cells. The enzyme responsible for this fixation is PEP carboxylase or PEPcase. It is important to register that the mesophyll cells lack RuBisCO enzyme. The C4 acid OAA is formed in the mesophyll cells. It then forms other 4-carbon compounds like malic acid or aspartic acid in the mesophyll cells itself, which are transported to the bundle sheath cells. In the bundle sheath cells these C4 acids are broken down to release CO2 and a 3-carbon molecule. The 3-carbon molecule is transported back to the mesophyll where it is converted to PEP again, thus, completing the cycle. The CO2 released in the bundle sheath cells enters the C3 or the Calvin pathway, a pathway common to all plants. The bundle sheath cells are

Expand the abbreviation RuBP What is its role in photosynthesis?,"Full form of RuBP is Ribulose 1, 5 biphosphate. RuBP is the first acceptor of atmospheric CO2 during dark reaction of photosynthesis. The reaction is called carboxylation. 6RuBP + 6 CO2 + 6 CH2 O → Unstable 6C compound → 3PGA RuBP is regenerated during final formation of sugar molecule.","13.7.1 The Primary Acceptor of CO2 Let us now ask ourselves a question that was asked by the scientists who were struggling to understand the ‘dark reaction’. How many carbon atoms would a molecule have which after accepting (fixing) CO2, would have 3 carbons (of PGA)? The studies very unexpectedly showed that the acceptor molecule was a 5-carbon ketose sugar – ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). Did any of you think of this possibility? Do not worry; the scientists also took a long time and conducted many experiments to reach this conclusion. They also believed that since the first product was a C3 acid, the primary acceptor would be a 2-carbon compound; they spent many years trying to identify a 2-carbon compound before they discovered the 5-carbon RuBP.
 13.7.2 The Calvin Cycle Calvin and his co-workers then worked out the whole pathway and showed that the pathway operated in a cyclic manner; the RuBP was regenerated. Let us now see how the Calvin pathway operates and where the sugar is synthesised. Let us at the outset understand very clearly that the Calvin pathway occurs in all photosynthetic plants; it does not matter whether they have C3 or C4 (or any other) pathways (Figure 13.8). For ease of understanding, the Calvin cycle can be described under three stages: carboxylation, reduction and regeneration. 1. Carboxylation – Carboxylation is the fixation of CO2 into a stable organic intermediate. Carboxylation is the most crucial step of the Calvin cycle where CO2 is utilised for the carboxylation of RuBP. This reaction is catalysed by the enzyme RuBP carboxylase which results in the formation of two molecules of 3-PGA. Since this enzyme also has an oxygenation activity it would be more correct to call it RuBP carboxylase-oxygenase or RuBisCO.
 13.9 PHOTORESPIRATION Let us try and understand one more process that creates an important difference between C3 and C4 plants – Photorespiration. To understand photorespiration we have to know a little bit more about the first step of the Calvin pathway – the first CO2 fixation step. This is the reaction where RuBP combines with CO2 to form 2 molecules of 3PGA, that is catalysed by RuBisCO. RuBisCo → 2 × 3PGA RuBP + CO2 
 RuBisCO that is the most abundant enzyme in the world (Do you wonder why?) is characterised by the fact that its active site can bind to both CO2 and O2 – hence the name. Can you think how this could be possible? RuBisCO has a much greater affinity for CO2 when the CO2: O2 is nearly equal. Imagine what would happen if this were not so! This binding is competitive. It is the relative concentration of O2 and CO2 that determines which of the two will bind to the enzyme. In C3 plants some O2 does bind to RuBisCO, and hence CO2 fixation is decreased. Here the RuBP instead of being converted to 2 molecules of PGA binds with O2 to form one molecule of phosphoglycerate and phosphoglycolate (2 Carbon) in a pathway called photorespiration. In the photorespiratory pathway, there is neither synthesis of sugars, nor of ATP. Rather it results in the release of CO2 with the utilisation of ATP. In the photorespiratory pathway there is no synthesis of ATP or NADPH. The biological function of photorespiration is not known yet. In C4 plants photorespiration does not occur. This is because they have a mechanism that increases the concentration of CO2 at the enzyme site. This takes place when the C4 acid from the mesophyll is broken down in the bundle sheath cells to release CO2 – this results in increasing the intracellular concentration of CO2. In turn, this ensures that the RuBisCO functions as a carboxylase minimising the oxygenase activity. Now that you know that the C4 plants lack photorespiration, you probably can understand why productivity and yields are better in these plants. In addition these plants show tolerance to higher temperatures. Based on the above discussion can you compare plants showing the C3 and the C4 pathway? Use the table format given and fill in the information.

Distinguish between: Respiration and Photorespiration.,S. No.  Respiration  (i)  It is a bio-chemical process where energy and CO2 is released during oxidation of food. Glucose is main substance of it.  (ii)  This process is intitiated in the presence of respiratory enzymen like oxidases and decarbosylases.  Photorespiration it is the reversal of photosynthetic reaction where abundant of CO2 is liberated from the photosynthetic tissues in the presence of light. Enzyme RuBP carboxylase initiates the photoripiration. Glycolate is the main substrate it. ,"directly (herbivores) or indirectly (carnivores). Saprophytes like fungi are dependent on dead and decaying matter. What is important to recognise is that ultimately all the food that is respired for life processes comes from photosynthesis. This chapter deals with cellular respiration or the mechanism of breakdown of food materials within the cell to release energy, and the trapping of this energy for synthesis of ATP. Photosynthesis, of course, takes place within the chloroplasts (in the eukaryotes), whereas the breakdown of complex molecules to yield energy takes place in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria (also only in eukaryotes). The breaking of the C-C bonds of complex compounds through oxidation within the cells, leading to release of considerable amount of energy is called respiration. The compounds that are oxidised during this process are known as respiratory substrates. Usually carbohydrates are oxidised to release energy, but proteins, fats and even organic acids can be used as respiratory substances in some plants, under certain conditions. During oxidation within a cell, all the energy contained in respiratory substrates is not released free into the cell, or in a single step. It is released in a series of slow step-wise reactions controlled by enzymes, and it is trapped as chemical energy in the form of ATP. Hence, it is important to understand that the energy released by oxidation in respiration is not (or rather cannot be) used directly but is used to synthesise ATP, which is broken down whenever (and wherever) energy needs to be utilised. Hence, ATP acts as the energy currency of the cell. This energy trapped in ATP is utilised in various energy-requiring processes of the organisms, and the carbon skeleton produced during respiration is used as precursors for biosynthesis of other molecules in the cell.

What is the aignificance of photolysis of water in phulophosphorylation? What happens to each product of this process? ,"(i) The photochemical phase is Hill reaction. It oceurs in presence of light. It includes excitation of chlorophyll, photolysis of water molecule, photophosphorylation and reduction of NADP to 15 NADPH2. (ii) The excited chlorophyll transfers an electron from chlorophyll in many steps. Chlorophyll loses an electron from the water molecule in E.T.S. system. Water splits into H + and O H − ions. O2 is released in it. (iii) The fomation of ATP by linking ADP and Pi is called photophosphorylation in photosynthetic ETC. ADP + Pi → ATP. It includes two sets of photochemical reactions catalysed in pigment systems PS-I and PS-II. NADP is then reduced is NADPH2.","ATP is synthesised by cells (in mitochondria and Photosystem I chloroplasts) is named phosphorylation.

What are the various events which are responsible for causing proton gradient across the membrane ?,"The various events that cause the proton gradient across the membrane are: (i) The splitting of water molecule takes place on the inner side of the membrane. The protone (H + ions) that are produced by the splitting of water accumulate within the lumen of thylakoids. (ii) As electrons move through the photosystems, protons are transported across the membrane. This happens because the primary acceptor of electron which is located towards the outer side of the membrane, transfers its electron carrier to a proton (H + ) carrier. (iii) The NADP reductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the membrane. Along with electrons, protons are necessary for the reduction of NADP + to NADPH + H + .","(b) As electrons move through the photosystems, protons are transported across the membrane. This happens because the primary accepter of electron which is located towards the outer side of the membrane transfers its electron not to an electron carrier but to an H carrier. Hence, this molecule removes a proton from the stroma while transporting an electron. When this molecule passes on its electron to the electron carrier on the inner side of the membrane, the proton is released into the inner side or the lumen side of the membrane. (c) The NADP reductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the membrane. Along with electrons that come from the acceptor of electrons of PS I, protons are necessary for the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH+ H+. These protons are also removed from the stroma. Hence, within the chloroplast, protons in the stroma decrease in number, while in the lumen there is accumulation of protons. This creates a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane as well as a measurable decrease in pH in the lumen. Why are we so interested in the proton gradient? This gradient is important because it is the breakdown of this gradient that leads to the synthesis of ATP. The gradient is broken down due to the movement of protons across the membrane to the stroma through the transmembrane

(iv) On observation it was found that oxygen evolved in photosynthesis was heavy oxygen 18 O2 and not the natural osygen. (v) Now, the bheavy isotope of carbon dioxide ( C14 O2 ) was supplied to the plant. (vi) Thus it showed that in photosynthesis, oxygen is evolved from water molecules and not from carbon dicnide.","where [CH2O] represented a carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, a six-carbon sugar). A milestone contribution to the understanding of photosynthesis was that made by a microbiologist, Cornelius van Niel (1897-1985), who, based on his studies of purple and green bacteria, demonstrated that photosynthesis is essentially a light-dependent reaction in which hydrogen from a suitable oxidisable compound reduces carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. This can be expressed by: Light 2H2 A + CO2  → 2 A + CH2 O + H2 O

 In green plants H2O is the hydrogen donor and is oxidised to O2. Some organisms do not release O2 during photosynthesis.

Q. 16 Why are 𝐂𝟒 plants preferred in the tropical region ?   ,"𝐂𝟒 plants preferred in tropical region because: (i) They consume 30 ATPs (12 ATPs more than C3 plants) to produce one molecule of glucose favoured im tropical region. (ii) In these plants.photorespiration is the mechanism not to lose the photosynthetic carbon. (iii) In the process of photorespiration, RuBP is catabolised to a 3-carbon atom compound instead of combining with CO2 . (iv) More than 50% CO2 fixed by photosynthesis is lost in photorespiration. (v) Photorespiration acts to undo the work of photosynthesis as no energy rich compound is produced during this process. (vi) Thus C4 plants are better photosynthesizers than C3 plants and C4 pathway is of adaptive advantage in tropical region and thus these plants are preferred.","RuBisCO that is the most abundant enzyme in the world (Do you wonder why?) is characterised by the fact that its active site can bind to both CO2 and O2 – hence the name.

It is the relative concentration of O2 and CO2 that determines which of the two will bind to the enzyme. In C3 plants some O2 does bind to RuBisCO, and hence CO2 fixation is decreased. Here the RuBP instead of being converted to 2 molecules of PGA binds with O2 to form one molecule of phosphoglycerate and phosphoglycolate (2 Carbon) in a pathway called photorespiration.

In the photorespiratory pathway there is no synthesis of ATP or NADPH. The biological function of photorespiration is not known yet. In C4 plants photorespiration does not occur. This is because they have a mechanism that increases the concentration of CO2 at the enzyme site.

How does carboxylation take place in a sugarcane plant ?,"Sugarcane is a monocotyledonous plant. It has developed an additional C4 cycle. Carboxylation in sugarcane: (i) Three molecules of RuBP (Ribulose 1-5 biphosphate) reacts with three molecules of carbon dioxide to produce short lived si-carbon intermediates. This process is called carboxylation and involves the enzyme RuBP carboxylase (or RubisCo) (ii) The bcarbon intermediate are immediately broken down into 6 molecules of 3 phosphoglyceric and (3PGA), a 3 carbon compound. RuBisCO is a large protein molecule. (iii) It comprises 16% of the chloroplast protein and is the most important protein on earth.  For every three molecules of CO2 that entar the cycle, the net output is one molecule d glyceraldehyde phosphate, a three-carbon sugar. To fix the three CO2 molecules, the cycle spends nine molecules of ATP and six molecules of NADPH.","rich in an enzyme Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO), but lack PEPcase.

Distinguish between : Carboxylation and Oxygenation.,"S. No.  Carboxylation  Oxygenation  (i)  It is the first step of Calvin cycle (C3 in biosynthetic phase). Ribulose 1, 5 bisphosphate is acceptor molecule in it. Ribulose 1, 5 biphosphate combines with a molecule of CO2 in presence of light regulated enzyme RuBP carboxylase Fixation of CO2 is called carboxylation.  The oxygenation of RuBP in presence of O2 : is the first reaction of photorespiration. The initial acceptor molecule is RuBP. The photorespiration is initiated in the chloroplasts in light only.  (ii) (iii)  (iv)  The activity of RuBP to catalyse the combination of O2 with RuBP is oxygenation. ","Sucrose, starch Figure 13.8 The Calvin cycle proceeds in three stages : (1) carboxylation, during which CO2 combines with ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate; (2) reduction, during which carbohydrate is formed at the expense of the photochemically made ATP and NADPH; and (3) regeneration during which the CO2 acceptor ribulose1,5-bisphosphate is formed again so that the cycle continues
 2. Reduction – These are a series of reactions that lead to the formation of glucose. The steps involve utilisation of 2 molecules of ATP for phosphorylation and two of NADPH for reduction per CO2 molecule fixed. The fixation of six molecules of CO2 and 6 turns of the cycle are required for the formation of one molecule of glucose from the pathway. 3. Regeneration – Regeneration of the CO2 acceptor molecule RuBP is crucial if the cycle is to continue uninterrupted. The regeneration steps require one ATP for phosphorylation to form RuBP.

When and why does photorespiration take place in plants ? How does this process result in a loss to the plant ?,Photorespiration : (i) It is a threat to plants although it occurs in angiosperms because it has some disadvantages. (ii) No energy rich compound is produced in this process. (iii) Half of the photosynthetically fixed CO2 may be lost by photorespiration. (iv) Moreover it is a ks to the net productivity of green and C3 plants.  (v) To evercome the photcrespinatory loses in angloxperms like sugareane.they have developed an additiomal cycle called as C4 pathway or Hatch Sluck pathway. (vi) C4 pathway requires 30 ATP molecules (more energy).,"creates transpiration pull for absorption and transport of plants supplies water for photosynthesis transports minerals from the soil to all parts of the plant cools leaf surfaces, sometimes 10 to 15 degrees, by evaporative cooling • maintains the shape and structure of the plants by keeping cells turgid An actively photosynthesising plant has an insatiable need for water. Photosynthesis is limited by available water which can be swiftly depleted by transpiration. The humidity of rainforests is largely due to this vast cycling of water from root to leaf to atmosphere and back to the soil. The evolution of the C4 photosynthetic system is probably one of the strategies for maximising the availability of CO2 while minimising water loss. C4 plants are twice as efficient as C3 plants in terms of fixing carbon dioxide (making sugar). However, a C4 plant loses only half as much water as a C3 plant for the same amount of CO2 fixed.

who proposed the hypothesis that all photosynthetic organisms require a source of hydregrn and in plants this source wan water and the oxygen is evolved by splitting of water ? What observation led to propose this hypothesis?,"Van Niel in 1931 proposed the hypothesis that all photosynthetic organisms require a source of hydrogen and in plants this source is water and the oxygen is evolved by the splitting of water. (i) Van Niel observed that green sulphur photosynthetic bacteria fixed carbon dioxide in presence of hydrogen sulphide. (ii) Okygen was not evolved instead globules of sulphur was formed. (iii) From this observation he concluded that during bacterial photosynthesis CO2 does not split, instead hydrogen sulphide splits and acts as a hydrogen donor to CO2 to form carbohydrates and molecular sulphur is released as one of the products. 𝑃𝐸𝑃 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒  6CO2 + 12H2 S →  C6 H12 O6 + 6H2 O + 12S  This observation on photosynthetic bacteria led Van Niel to propose above given hypothesis.","It was not until about 1854 that Julius von Sachs provided evidence for production of glucose when plants grow. Glucose is usually stored as starch. His later studies showed that the green substance in plants (chlorophyll as we know it now) is located in special bodies (later called chloroplasts) within plant cells. He found that the green parts in plants is where glucose is made, and that the glucose is usually stored as starch. Now consider the interesting experiments done by T.W Engelmann (1843 – 1909). Using a prism he split light into its spectral components and then illuminated a green alga, Cladophora, placed in a suspension of aerobic bacteria. The bacteria were used to detect the sites of O2 evolution. He observed that the bacteria accumulated mainly in the region of blue and red light of the split spectrum. A first action spectrum of photosynthesis was thus described. It resembles roughly the absorption spectra of chlorophyll a and b (discussed in section 13.4). By the middle of the nineteenth century the key features of plant photosynthesis were known, namely, that plants could use light energy to make carbohydrates from CO2 and water. The empirical equation representing the total process of photosynthesis for oxygen evolving organisms was then understood as: Light CO2 + H2 O  → [CH2 O] + O2
 where [CH2O] represented a carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, a six-carbon sugar). A milestone contribution to the understanding of photosynthesis was that made by a microbiologist, Cornelius van Niel (1897-1985), who, based on his studies of purple and green bacteria, demonstrated that photosynthesis is essentially a light-dependent reaction in which hydrogen from a suitable oxidisable compound reduces carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. This can be expressed by: Light 2H2 A + CO2  → 2 A + CH2 O + H2 O

Mention the initial fixation in C4 pathway.,(i) Initial fixation of CO2 occurs in mesophyll cells. (ii) The primary acceptor of CO2 is phosphoenol pyruvate or PEP. It combines with CO2 in the presence of PEP carboxylase to form oxaloacetic acid or oxaloacetate. PEP + CO2 + H2 O → Oxalo-acetic acid + H3 PO4 (iii) Oraloacetic acid is reduced to malic acid or transaminated to form aspartic acid. ,"Now study the pathway shown in Figure 13.9. This pathway that has been named the Hatch and Slack Pathway, is again a cyclic process. Let us study the pathway by listing the steps. The primary CO2 acceptor is a 3-carbon molecule phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) and is present in the mesophyll cells. The enzyme responsible for this fixation is PEP carboxylase or PEPcase. It is important to register that the mesophyll cells lack RuBisCO enzyme. The C4 acid OAA is formed in the mesophyll cells. It then forms other 4-carbon compounds like malic acid or aspartic acid in the mesophyll cells itself, which are transported to the bundle sheath cells. In the bundle sheath cells these C4 acids are broken down to release CO2 and a 3-carbon molecule. The 3-carbon molecule is transported back to the mesophyll where it is converted to PEP again, thus, completing the cycle. The CO2 released in the bundle sheath cells enters the C3 or the Calvin pathway, a pathway common to all plants. The bundle sheath cells are

What is the law of limiting factor? Explain. ,"Law of limiting Factor: (i) It was proposed by F.F. Blackmann (1905). (ii) It states that ""if a chemical process is affected by more than one factor, then its rate will be determined by the factor which is nearest to its minimal value; it is the factor that directly atfects process as its quantity is changed’’. (iii) The rate of photosynthesis is affected mainly by the concentration of CO2 light intensity and the temperature. (iv) As the light intensity is increased, the rate of photosynthesis increases proportionately until some other factor like CO2 or temperature may become limiting. (v) Similarly, if the concentration of CO2 is increased, the rate of photosynthesis increases until light may become a limiting factor","13.10 FACTORS AFFECTING PHOTOSYNTHESIS
 Rate of photosynthesis
 An understanding of the factors that affect photosynthesis is necessary. The rate of photosynthesis is very important in determining the yield of plants including crop plants. Photosynthesis is under the influence of several factors, both internal (plant) and external. The plant factors include the number, size, age and orientation of leaves, mesophyll cells and chloroplasts, internal CO2 concentration and the amount of chlorophyll. The plant or internal factors are dependent on the genetic predisposition and the growth of the plant. The external factors would include the availability of sunlight, temperature, CO2 concentration and water. As a plant photosynthesises, all these factors will simultaneously affect its rate. Hence, though several factors interact and simultaneously affect photosynthesis or CO2 fixation, usually one factor is the major cause or is the one that limits the rate. Hence, at any point the rate will be determined by the factor available at sub-optimal levels. When several factors affect any [bio] chemical process, Blackman’s (1905) Law of Limiting Factors comes into effect. This states the following: If a chemical process is affected by more than one factor, then its rate will be determined by the factor which is nearest to its minimal value: it is the factor which directly affects the process if its quantity is changed. For example, despite the presence of a green leaf and optimal light and CO2 conditions, the plant may not photosynthesise if the temperature is very low. This leaf, if given the optimal temperature, will start photosynthesising.

(i) Which pathway prevents photorespiration in plants? Explain it. (ii) What is the role of RuBisCo?   ,"(i) C, pathway or Hatch-Slack pathway prevents photorespiration in plants as these plants are adapted to dry tropical regions 𝐸. 𝑔. of C4 plants are sugarcane, maize, sorghum, pearl millet etc. in these plants, the vascular bundles are surrounded by large sized bundle sheath cells which are arranged is a wreath-like manner (Kranz - wreath). The anatomy of such leaves are called as Kranz Anatomy. (ii) RuBisCo catalyses the carboxylation of RuBP to form an unstable 6C compound which breaks up into two 3C compound 𝑖. 𝑒. PGA Here the enzyme RuBisCo acts an carboxylase. At high temperature RuBP acts as oxygenase to form 4C compound OAA.3  ","13.8 THE C4 PATHWAY Plants that are adapted to dry tropical regions have the C4 pathway mentioned earlier. Though these plants have the C4 oxaloacetic acid as the first CO2 fixation product they use the C3 pathway or the Calvin cycle as the main biosynthetic pathway. Then, in what way are they different from C3 plants? This is a question that you may reasonably ask. C4 plants are special: They have a special type of leaf anatomy, they tolerate higher temperatures, they show a response to high light intensities, they lack a process called photorespiration and have greater productivity of biomass. Let us understand these one by one. Study vertical sections of leaves, one of a C3 plant and the other of a C4 plant. Do you notice the differences? Do both have the same types of mesophylls? Do they have similar cells around the vascular bundle sheath? The particularly large cells around the vascular bundles of the C4 plants are called bundle sheath cells, and the leaves which have such anatomy are said to have ‘Kranz’ anatomy. ‘Kranz’ means ‘wreath’ and is a reflection of the arrangement of cells. The bundle sheath cells may form several layers around the vascular bundles; they are characterised by having a large number of chloroplasts, thick walls impervious to gaseous exchange and no intercellular spaces. You may like to cut a section of the leaves of C4 plants – maize or sorghum – to observe the Kranz anatomy and the distribution of mesophyll cells. It would be interesting for you to collect leaves of diverse species of plants around you and cut vertical sections of the leaves. Observe under the microscope – look for the bundle sheath around the vascular bundles. The presence of the bundle sheath would help you identify the C4 plants.
 rich in an enzyme Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO), but lack PEPcase. Thus, the basic pathway that results in the formation of the sugars, the Calvin pathway, is common to the C3 and C4 plants. Did you note that the Calvin pathway occurs in all the mesophyll cells of the C3 plants? In the C4 plants it does not take place in the mesophyll cells but does so only in the bundle sheath cells.
 13.9 PHOTORESPIRATION Let us try and understand one more process that creates an important difference between C3 and C4 plants – Photorespiration. To understand photorespiration we have to know a little bit more about the first step of the Calvin pathway – the first CO2 fixation step.

It is the relative concentration of O2 and CO2 that determines which of the two will bind to the enzyme. In C3 plants some O2 does bind to RuBisCO, and hence CO2 fixation is decreased. Here the RuBP instead of being converted to 2 molecules of PGA binds with O2 to form one molecule of phosphoglycerate and phosphoglycolate (2 Carbon) in a pathway called photorespiration. In the photorespiratory pathway, there is neither synthesis of sugars, nor of ATP. Rather it results in the release of CO2 with the utilisation of ATP. In the photorespiratory pathway there is no synthesis of ATP or NADPH. The biological function of photorespiration is not known yet. In C4 plants photorespiration does not occur.

Describe the types of carotenoids found in plastids,"There are two types of carotenoids: (i) Carotenes : They are hydrocarbons with a general formula of C40 H56 . The most common carotence is 𝛽-carotene which is converted to vitamin A by animals and human beings. (ii) Xanthophylls : They are oxygen containing derivative of carotenes e.g., C40 H56 .O (cryptoxanthin), C40 H56 O2, (lutein, zeaxanthin).","types. The R group in these proteinaceous amino acids could be a hydrogen (the amino acid is called glycine), a methyl group (alanine), hydroxy methyl (serine), etc. Three of the twenty are shown in Figure 9.1. The chemical and physical properties of amino acids are essentially of the amino, carboxyl and the R functional groups. Based on number of amino and carboxyl groups, there are acidic (e.g., glutamic acid), basic (lysine) and neutral (valine) amino acids. Similarly, there are aromatic amino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan). A particular property of amino acids is the ionizable nature of –NH2 and –COOH groups. Hence in solutions of different pH, the structure of amino acids changes.
 B is called zwitterionic form. Lipids are generally water insoluble. They could be simple fatty acids. A fatty acid has a carboxyl group attached to an R group. The R group could be a methyl (–CH3), or ethyl (–C2H5) or higher number of –CH2 groups (1 carbon to 19 carbons). For example, palmitic acid has 16 carbons including carboxyl carbon. Arachidonic acid has 20 carbon atoms including the carboxyl carbon. Fatty acids could be saturated (without double bond) or unsaturated (with one or more C=C double bonds). Another simple lipid is glycerol which is trihydroxy propane. Many lipids have both glycerol and fatty acids. Here the fatty acids are found esterified with glycerol. They can be then monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides. These are also called fats and oils based on melting point. Oils have lower melting point (e.g., gingelly oil) and hence remain as oil in winters. Can you identify a fat from the market? Some lipids have phosphorous and a phosphorylated organic compound in them. These are phospholipids. They are found in cell membrane. Lecithin is one example. Some tissues especially the neural tissues have lipids with more complex structures. Living organisms have a number of carbon compounds in which heterocyclic rings can be found. Some of these are nitrogen bases – adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, and thymine. When found attached to a sugar, they are called nucleosides. If a phosphate group is also found esterified to the sugar they are called nucleotides. Adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and cytidine are nucleosides. Adenylic acid, thymidylic acid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid and cytidylic acid are nucleotides. Nucleic acids like DNA and RNA consist of nucleotides only. DNA and RNA function as genetic material.
 14.4.1 Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle The TCA cycle starts with the condensation of acetyl group with oxaloacetic acid (OAA) and water to yield citric acid (Figure 14.3).

It is followed by two successive steps of decarboxylation, leading to the formation of α-ketoglutaric acid

 RuBisCO that is the most abundant enzyme in the world (Do you wonder why?) is characterised by the fact that its active site can bind to both CO2 and O2 – hence the name. Can you think how this could be possible? RuBisCO has a much greater affinity for CO2 when the CO2: O2 is nearly equal. Imagine what would happen if this were not so! This binding is competitive. It is the relative concentration of O2 and CO2 that determines which of the two will bind to the enzyme. In C3 plants some O2 does bind to RuBisCO, and hence CO2 fixation is decreased. Here the RuBP instead of being converted to 2 molecules of PGA binds with O2 to form one molecule of phosphoglycerate and phosphoglycolate (2 Carbon) in a pathway called photorespiration. In the photorespiratory pathway, there is neither synthesis of sugars, nor of ATP. Rather it results in the release of CO2 with the utilisation of ATP. In the photorespiratory pathway there is no synthesis of ATP or NADPH. The biological function of photorespiration is not known yet. In C4 plants photorespiration does not occur. This is because they have a mechanism that increases the concentration of CO2 at the enzyme site. This takes place when the C4 acid from the mesophyll is broken down in the bundle sheath cells to release CO2 – this results in increasing the intracellular concentration of CO2. In turn, this ensures that the RuBisCO functions as a carboxylase minimising the oxygenase activity. Now that you know that the C4 plants lack photorespiration, you probably can understand why productivity and yields are better in these plants. In addition these plants show tolerance to higher temperatures. Based on the above discussion can you compare plants showing the C3 and the C4 pathway?

What are the two main steps of photosynthesis ?,Photosynthesis consists of two steps: (i) In photochemical phase or light reaction solar energy is trapped by chlorophyll and stored in the form of chemical energy of ATP and as reducing power in NADP H2 . Oxygen is involved in the light reaction by splitting of water (photolysis of water). (ii) Biosynthetic phase or dark reaction in which the reducing capacity of NADPH and the energy of ATP are utilized in the conversion of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates.,"We learnt that the products of light reaction are ATP, NADPH and O2. Of these O2 diffuses out of the chloroplast while ATP and NADPH are used to drive the processes leading to the synthesis of food, more accurately, sugars. This is the biosynthetic phase of photosynthesis. This process does not directly depend on the presence of light but is dependent on the products of the light reaction, i.e., ATP and NADPH, besides CO2 and H2O. You may wonder how this could be verified; it is simple: immediately after light becomes unavailable, the biosynthetic process continues for some time, and then stops. If then, light is made available, the synthesis starts again. Can we, hence, say that calling the biosynthetic phase as the dark reaction is a misnomer? Discuss this amongst yourselves. Let us now see how the ATP and NADPH are used in the biosynthetic phase. We saw earlier that CO2 is combined with H2O to produce (CH2O)n or sugars. It was of interest to scientists to find out how this reaction proceeded, or rather what was the first product formed when CO2 is taken into a reaction or fixed. Just after world war II, among the several efforts to put radioisotopes to beneficial use, the work of Melvin Calvin is exemplary. The use of radioactive 14C by him in algal photosynthesis studies led to the discovery that the first CO2 fixation product was a 3-carbon organic acid. He also contributed to working out the complete biosynthetic pathway; hence it was called Calvin cycle after him. The first product identified was 3-phosphoglyceric acid or in short PGA. How many carbon atoms does it have?

What are cardinal points ? How does they affect the physiological process ?,"A factor influencing a physiological process has three principle values called cardinal points, minimum, optimum and maximum. (i) The minimum of a factor is that valiue below which the physiological process cannot continue. (ii) Optimum value is that point where the physiological process can continue indefinitely at its highest velocity. (iii) Maximum value is that beyond which the process comes to stop.","this increases the pressure potential. Pressure potential is usually positive, though in plants negative potential or tension in the water column in the xylem plays a major role in water transport up a stem. Pressure potential is denoted as Ψp. Water potential of a cell is affected by both solute and pressure potential. The relationship between them is as follows: Ψw = Ψs + Ψp

(b) Purple spots on the leaves of the plants.","membrane, maintenance of osmotic concentration of cell sap, electrontransport systems, buffering action, enzymatic activity and act as major constituents of macromolecules and co-enzymes. Various forms and functions of essential nutrient elements are given below. Nitrogen: This is the essential nutrient element required by plants in the greatest amount. It is absorbed mainly as NO3– though some are also taken up as NO2– or NH4+. Nitrogen is required by all parts of a plant, particularly the meristematic tissues and the metabolically active cells. Nitrogen is one of the major constituents of proteins, nucleic acids, vitamins and hormones. Phosphorus: Phosphorus is absorbed by the plants from soil in the form of phosphate ions (either as H2 PO−4 or HPO2− ). Phosphorus is a 4 constituent of cell membranes, certain proteins, all nucleic acids and nucleotides, and is required for all phosphorylation reactions. Potassium: It is absorbed as potassium ion (K+). In plants, this is required in more abundant quantities in the meristematic tissues, buds, leaves and root tips. Potassium helps to maintain an anion-cation balance in cells and is involved in protein synthesis, opening and closing of stomata, activation of enzymes and in the maintenance of the turgidity of cells. Calcium: Plant absorbs calcium from the soil in the form of calcium ions (Ca2+). Calcium is required by meristematic and differentiating tissues. During cell division it is used in the synthesis of cell wall, particularly as calcium pectate in the middle lamella. It is also needed during the formation of mitotic spindle. It accumulates in older leaves. It is involved in the normal functioning of the cell membranes. It activates certain enzymes and plays an important role in regulating metabolic activities. Magnesium: It is absorbed by plants in the form of divalent Mg2+. It activates the enzymes of respiration, photosynthesis and are involved in the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Magnesium is a constituent of the ring structure of chlorophyll and helps to maintain the ribosome structure. . Sulphur is Sulphur: Plants obtain sulphur in the form of sulphate (SO2− 4 ) present in two amino acids – cysteine and methionine and is the main constituent of several coenzymes, vitamins (thiamine, biotin, Coenzyme A) and ferredoxin. Iron: Plants obtain iron in the form of ferric ions (Fe3+). It is required in larger amounts in comparison to other micronutrients. It is an important constituent of proteins involved in the transfer of electrons like ferredoxin and cytochromes. It is reversibly oxidised from Fe2+ to Fe3+ during electron transfer. It activates catalase enzyme, and is essential for the formation of chlorophyll.

"Write one function of sulphur, potassium and iron?   ","Functions of sulphur, potassium and iron are: (i) Sulphur : Chlorophyll formation and nodule formation in legumes. (ii) Potassium : It plays important role in energy transfer and cell division. (iii) Iron : It is involved in development of chloroplast, chlorophyll and other pigments.","Manganese: It is absorbed in the form of manganous ions (Mn2+). It activates many enzymes involved in photosynthesis, respiration and nitrogen metabolism. The best defined function of manganese is in the splitting of water to liberate oxygen during photosynthesis. Zinc: Plants obtain zinc as Zn2+ ions. It activates various enzymes, especially carboxylases. It is also needed in the synthesis of auxin. Copper: It is absorbed as cupric ions (Cu2+). It is essential for the overall metabolism in plants. Like iron, it is associated with certain enzymes involved in redox reactions and is reversibly oxidised from Cu+ to Cu2+. Boron : It is absorbed as BO3− or B 4O2− . Boron is required for uptake 3 7 2+ and utilisation of Ca , membrane functioning, pollen germination, cell elongation, cell differentiation and carbohydrate translocation. Molybdenum: Plants obtain it in the form of molybdate ions ( MoO2+ . It 2 ) is a component of several enzymes, including nitrogenase and nitrate reductase both of which participate in nitrogen metabolism. Chlorine: It is absorbed in the form of chloride anion (Cl–). Along with Na+ and K+, it helps in determining the solute concentration and the anioncation balance in cells. It is essential for the water-splitting reaction in photosynthesis, a reaction that leads to oxygen evolution.

The ammonia that is absorbed by the plants is used to synthesize various amino acids. Explain the main two ways by which this is done. ,"At physiological pH, the ammonia is protonated to form NH4+ (ammonium) ion while most of the plants can assimilate nitrate as well as ammonium ions, the latter is quite toxic to plants and hence cannot accumulate in them. There are two main ways by which this can take place : (i) Reductive amination : In these processes, ammonia reacts with α-ketoglutaric acid and The two most important amides - asparagine and glutamine - found in plants are a structural part of proteins.

The hydroxyl part of the acid is replaced by another NH 2-radicle.","very high input of energy (8 ATP for each NH3 produced). The energy required, thus, is obtained from the respiration of the host cells. Fate of ammonia: At physiological pH, the ammonia is protonated to form NH+4 (ammonium) ion. While most of the plants can assimilate nitrate as well as ammonium ions, the latter is quite toxic to plants and hence cannot accumulate in them. Let us now see how the NH+4 is used to synthesise amino acids in plants. There are two main ways in which this can take place: (i) Reductive amination : In these processes, ammonia reacts with α-ketoglutaric acid and forms glutamic acid as indicated in the equation given below : Glutamate α − ketoglutaric acid + NH4+ + NADPH   → glutamate + H2 O + NADP Dehydrogenase
 (ii) Transamination : It involves the transfer of amino group from one amino acid to the keto group of a keto acid. Glutamic acid is the main amino acid from which the transfer of NH2, the amino group takes place and other amino acids are formed through transamination. The enzyme transaminase catalyses all such reactions. For example,
 The two most important amides – asparagine and glutamine – found in plants are a structural part of proteins. They are formed from two amino acids, namely aspartic acid and glutamic acid, respectively, by addition of another amino group to each. The hydroxyl part of the acid is replaced by another NH2– radicle. Since amides contain more nitrogen than the amino acids, they are transported to other parts of the plant via xylem vessels. In addition, along with the transpiration stream the nodules of some plants (e.g., soyabean) export the fixed nitrogen as ureides. These compounds also have a particularly high nitrogen to carbon ratio.

What is non-symbiotic N2 fixation?

Symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation Several types of symbiotic biological nitrogen fixing associations are known. The most prominent among them is the legume-bacteria relationship. Species of rod-shaped Rhizobium has such relationship with the roots of several legumes such as alfalfa, sweet clover, sweet pea, lentils, garden pea, broad bean, clover beans, etc. The most common association on roots is as nodules. These nodules are small outgrowths on the roots. The microbe, Frankia, also produces nitrogen-fixing nodules on the roots of nonleguminous plants (e.g., Alnus).

You will see near-spherical outgrowths on the roots. These are nodules. If you cut through them you will notice that the central portion is red or pink. What makes the nodules pink? This is due to the presence of leguminous haemoglobin or leg-haemoglobin. Nodule Formation Nodule formation involves a sequence of multiple interactions between Rhizobium and roots of the host plant. Principal stages in the nodule formation are summarised as follows: Rhizobia multiply and colonise the surroundings of roots and get attached to epidermal and root hair cells. The root-hairs curl and the bacteria invade the root-hair. An infection thread is produced carrying the bacteria into the cortex of the root, where they initiate the nodule formation in the cortex of the root. Then the bacteria are released from the thread into the cells which leads to the differentiation of specialised nitrogen fixing cells. The nodule thus formed, establishes a direct vascular connection with the host for exchange of nutrients. These events are depicted in Figure 12.4. The nodule contains all the necessary biochemical components, such as the enzyme nitrogenase and leghaemoglobin. The enzyme nitrogenase is a Mo-Fe protein and catalyses the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, (Figure 12.5) the first stable product of nitrogen fixation.

This is due to the presence of leguminous haemoglobin or leg-haemoglobin. Nodule Formation Nodule formation involves a sequence of multiple interactions between Rhizobium and roots of the host plant. Principal stages in the nodule formation are summarised as follows: Rhizobia multiply and colonise the surroundings of roots and get attached to epidermal and root hair cells. The root-hairs curl and the bacteria invade the root-hair. An infection thread is produced carrying the bacteria into the cortex of the root, where they initiate the nodule formation in the cortex of the root. Then the bacteria are released from the thread into the cells which leads to the differentiation of specialised nitrogen fixing cells. The nodule thus formed, establishes a direct vascular connection with the host for exchange of nutrients. These events are depicted in Figure 12.4. The nodule contains all the necessary biochemical components, such as the enzyme nitrogenase and leghaemoglobin. The enzyme nitrogenase is a Mo-Fe protein and catalyses the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, (Figure 12.5) the first stable product of nitrogen fixation.
 N2 + 8e – + 8H+ + 16ATP → 2NH3 + H2 + 16ADP + 16Pi The enzyme nitrogenase is highly sensitive to the molecular oxygen; it requires anaerobic conditions. The nodules have adaptations that ensure that the enzyme is protected from oxygen. To protect these enzymes, the nodule contains an oxygen scavenger called leg-haemoglobin. It is interesting to note that these microbes live as aerobes under free-living conditions (where nitrogenase is not operational), but during nitrogen-fixing events, they become anaerobic (thus protecting the nitrogenase enzyme). You must have noticed in the above reaction that the ammonia synthesis by nitrogenease requires a Product H [ammonia (NH3)]

What is nitrification Name two nitrifying bacteria of soil.,Nitrification refers to the phenomenon of conversion of ammonia into NO 2- (nitrite) and then into NO 3- (nitrates). Two nitrifying bacteria are : (i) 𝑁𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑠: It converts ammonía (NH 3) into nitrites (NO 2-). 2NH3 + 3O2 → 2H+ 2H2O + 2NO2(ii) 𝑁𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟 : It converts nitrites into nitrates. 2NO2- + O2 → 2NO3 ,"Ammonia is first oxidised to nitrite by the bacteria Nitrosomonas and/or Nitrococcus. The nitrite is further oxidised to nitrate with the help of the bacterium Nitrobacter. These steps are called nitrification (Figure 12.3). These nitrifying bacteria are chemoautotrophs. The nitrate thus formed is absorbed by plants and is transported to the leaves. In leaves, it is reduced to form ammonia that finally forms the amine group of amino acids. Nitrate present in the soil is also reduced to nitrogen by the process of denitrification. Denitrification is carried by bacteria Pseudomonas and Thiobacillus.

Chlorosis is the loss of chlorophyll leading to yellowing in leaves. This symptom is caused by the deficiency of elements N, K, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Zn and Mo. Likewise, necrosis, or death of tissue, particularly leaf tissue, is due to the deficiency of Ca, Mg, Cu, K. Lack or low level of N, K, S, Mo causes an inhibition of cell division. Some elements like N, S, Mo delay flowering if their concentration in plants is low. You can see from the above that the deficiency of any element can cause multiple symptoms and that the same symptoms may be caused by the deficiency of one of several different elements. Hence, to identify the deficient element, one has to study all the symptoms developed in all the various parts of the plant and compare them with the available standard tables. We must also be aware that different plants also respond differently to the deficiency of the same element.

Describe the process of progressive reduction of one molecule of nitrogen during fixation in leguminous plants.,"Process of progressive reduction of one molecule of nitrogen during fixation in leguminous plants: (i) The nodules are the sites of nitrogen fixation in leguminous plants. Nodules contain leghaemoglobin (Lb) and the enzymenitrogenase. (ii) Leghaemoglobin is a pink colour pigment similar to haemoglobin of vertebrates and functions as an oxygen-scavenger and protects the nitrogenase from oxygen. (iii) During this process, a dinitrogen (N ≡ N) molecule is reduced by the addition of hydrogen atoms into two molecules of ammonia catalysed by the nitrogenase enzyme. (iv) It requires (a) a strong reducing agent, (b) energy in the form of ATP to transfer the hydrogen atom and (c) the enzyme systems. The reaction is as follows: N2 + 8e- + 8H+ + 16 АТР → 2NH3 + H2 + 16 ADP + 16 Pi","called biological nitrogen fixation. The enzyme, nitrogenase which is capable of nitrogen reduction is present exclusively in prokaryotes. Such microbes are called N2- fixers. Nitrogenase N ≡ N → NH3
 The nitrogen-fixing microbes could be free-living or symbiotic. Examples of free-living nitrogen-fixing aerobic microbes are Azotobacter and Beijerinckia while Rhodospirillum is anaerobic and free-living. In addition, a number of cyanobacteria such as Anabaena and Nostoc are also freeliving nitrogen-fixers. Symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation Several types of symbiotic biological nitrogen fixing associations are known. The most prominent among them is the legume-bacteria relationship. Species of rod-shaped Rhizobium has such relationship with the roots of several legumes such as alfalfa, sweet clover, sweet pea, lentils, garden pea, broad bean, clover beans, etc. The most common association on roots is as nodules. These nodules are small outgrowths on the roots. The microbe, Frankia, also produces nitrogen-fixing nodules on the roots of nonleguminous plants (e.g., Alnus).

"The toxicity symptoms of manganese are actually the combined deficiency symptoms of iron, magnesium and calcium. Explain.","The prominent symptom of manganese toxicity is the appearance of brown spots surrounded by chlorotic veins. This is due to reduction in uptake of iron and magnesium, inhibition of binding of magnesium to specific enzymes and inhibition of calcium translocation in shoot apex. Therefore, excess of manganese causes deficiency of iron, magnesium and calcium. Thus the toxicity symptoms of Mn are actually the combined deficiency symptoms of Fe, Mg and Ca.","Manganese: It is absorbed in the form of manganous ions (Mn2+). It activates many enzymes involved in photosynthesis, respiration and nitrogen metabolism. The best defined function of manganese is in the splitting of water to liberate oxygen during photosynthesis. Zinc: Plants obtain zinc as Zn2+ ions. It activates various enzymes, especially carboxylases. It is also needed in the synthesis of auxin. Copper: It is absorbed as cupric ions (Cu2+). It is essential for the overall metabolism in plants. Like iron, it is associated with certain enzymes involved in redox reactions and is reversibly oxidised from Cu+ to Cu2+. Boron : It is absorbed as BO3− or B 4O2− . Boron is required for uptake 3 7 2+ and utilisation of Ca , membrane functioning, pollen germination, cell elongation, cell differentiation and carbohydrate translocation. Molybdenum: Plants obtain it in the form of molybdate ions ( MoO2+ . It 2 ) is a component of several enzymes, including nitrogenase and nitrate reductase both of which participate in nitrogen metabolism. Chlorine: It is absorbed in the form of chloride anion (Cl–). Along with Na+ and K+, it helps in determining the solute concentration and the anioncation balance in cells. It is essential for the water-splitting reaction in photosynthesis, a reaction that leads to oxygen evolution.
 12.2.3 Deficiency Symptoms of Essential Elements Whenever the supply of an essential element becomes limited, plant growth is retarded. The concentration of the essential element below which plant growth is retarded is termed as critical concentration. The element is said to be deficient when present below the critical concentration. Since each element has one or more specific structural or functional role in plants, in the absence of any particular element, plants show certain morphological changes. These morphological changes are indicative of certain element deficiencies and are called deficiency symptoms. The deficiency symptoms vary from element to element and they disappear when the deficient mineral nutrient is provided to the plant. However, if deprivation continues, it may eventually lead to the death of the plant. The parts of the plants that show the deficiency symptoms also depend on the mobility of the element in the plant. For elements that are actively mobilised within the plants and exported to young developing tissues, the deficiency symptoms tend to appear first in the older tissues. For example, the deficiency symptoms of nitrogen, potassium and magnesium are visible first in the senescent leaves. In the older leaves, biomolecules containing these elements are broken down, making these elements available for mobilising to younger leaves. The deficiency symptoms tend to appear first in the young tissues whenever the elements are relatively immobile and are not transported out of the mature organs, for example, element like sulphur and
 calcium are a part of the structural component of the cell and hence are not easily released. This aspect of mineral nutrition of plants is of a great significance and importance to agriculture and horticulture. The kind of deficiency symptoms shown in plants include chlorosis, necrosis, stunted plant growth, premature fall of leaves and buds, and inhibition of cell division. Chlorosis is the loss of chlorophyll leading to yellowing in leaves. This symptom is caused by the deficiency of elements N, K, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Zn and Mo.

We must also be aware that different plants also respond differently to the deficiency of the same element.
 12.2.4 Toxicity of Micronutrients The requirement of micronutrients is always in low amounts while their moderate decrease causes the deficiency symptoms and a moderate increase causes toxicity. In other words, there is a narrow range of concentration at which the elements are optimum. Any mineral ion concentration in tissues that reduces the dry weight of tissues by about 10 per cent is considered toxic. Such critical concentrations vary widely among different micronutrients. The toxicity symptoms are difficult to identify. Toxicity levels for any element also vary for different plants. Many a times, excess of an element may inhibit the uptake of another element. For example, the prominent symptom of manganese toxicity is the appearance of brown spots surrounded by chlorotic veins. It is important to know that manganese competes with iron and magnesium for uptake and with magnesium for binding with enzymes. Manganese also inhibit calcium translocation in shoot apex. Therefore, excess of manganese may, in fact, induce deficiencies of iron, magnesium and calcium. Thus, what appears as symptoms of manganese toxicity may actually be the deficiency symptoms of iron, magnesium and calcium. Can this knowledge be of some importance to a farmer? a gardener? or even for you in your kitchen-garden?

What is oxidative decarboxylation? What is its significance for Kreb's cycle? ,Oxidative decarboxylation: Pyruvic acid in molecules enter in the mitochondria where each of them is converted into two carbon atoms-acetic acid. One carbon is released as CO 2. The removal of carbon dioxide from pyruvic acid is called decarboxylation. Oxidative decarboxylation plays very significant role in Kreb's cycle. This step is called link reaction or transition reaction or gateway step as it links glycolysis with Krebs cycle.,"• The complete oxidation of pyruvate by the stepwise removal of all the hydrogen atoms, leaving three molecules of CO2.

What is interesting to note is that the first process takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria while the second process is located on the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Pyruvate, which is formed by the glycolytic catabolism of carbohydrates in the cytosol, after it enters mitochondrial matrix undergoes oxidative decarboxylation by a complex set of reactions catalysed by pyruvic dehydrogenase.

 14.4.1 Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle The TCA cycle starts with the condensation of acetyl group with oxaloacetic acid (OAA) and water to yield citric acid (Figure 14.3). The reaction is catalysed by the enzyme citrate synthase and a molecule of CoA is released. Citrate is then isomerised to isocitrate.

"How many ATP are produced during cellular respiration during- Glycolysis, Oxidative decarboxylation and Kreb's cycle? What is the net production of ATP? Define Respiratory Quotient. ","Complete aerobic breakdown of one molecule of hexose result in the release of ATP molecule. (i) Glycolysis: Two molecules of NADPH are released during glycolysis. The glycolysis also yields 4 ATP molecules out of which 2 ATP molecules are consumed. Thus the glycolysis contributes a total of 2 ATP molecule. (ii) 2 molecules of NADH produced in glycolysis also 6 ATR so the net gain of ATP is 6 ATP. (iii) Oxidative decarboxylation: Two molecules of NADH are released during the oxidative decarboxylation and synthesis of acetyl Co A from pyruvic acid. Thus number of ATP molecules will be 2 x 3 = 6. (iv) Kreb's cycle: Kreb's cycle releases 6 molecules of NADH and 2 molecules of FADH 2. The Kreb cycle also releases 2 ATP molecules, thus total number of ATP molecules produced during Kreb's cycle are 2 + 2 × 2 + 6 × 3 = 24 molecules. (v) Respiratory Quotient: Respiratory quotient is the ratio of the volume of carbon dioxide produced to the volume of oxygen consumed in respiration over a period of time. Its value can be one, zero, more than one and less than one.","2. Reduction – These are a series of reactions that lead to the formation of glucose. The steps involve utilisation of 2 molecules of ATP for phosphorylation and two of NADPH for reduction per CO2 molecule fixed. The fixation of six molecules of CO2 and 6 turns of the cycle are required for the formation of one molecule of glucose from the pathway. 3. Regeneration – Regeneration of the CO2 acceptor molecule RuBP is crucial if the cycle is to continue uninterrupted. The regeneration steps require one ATP for phosphorylation to form RuBP.

Explain the process of ATP formation during aerobic respiration (in mitochondria) ,The synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate using energy from proton gradient is called oxidative phosphorylation. This takes place in elementary particles present on the inner membrane of cristae of mitochondria. This process in mitochondria is catalyse by ATP synthetase. This complex has two major components-F0 and F1. F0 acts as channel for proton and F1 acts as on ATP synthetase.,"Figure 14.5 Diagramatic presentation of ATP synthesis in mitochondria
 transport system is utilised in synthesising ATP with the help of ATP synthase (complex V). This complex consists of two major components, F1 and F0 (Figure 14.5). The F1 headpiece is a peripheral membrane protein complex and contains the site for synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. F0 is an integral membrane protein complex that forms the channel through which protons cross the inner membrane. The passage of protons through the channel is coupled to the catalytic site of the F1 component for the production of ATP. For each ATP produced, 4H+ passes through F0 from the intermembrane space to the matrix down the electrochemical proton gradient.
 ATP is synthesised by cells (in mitochondria and Photosystem I chloroplasts) is named phosphorylation. Photophosphorylation is the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate in the presence of e - acceptor light. When the two photosystems work in a Light series, first PS II and then the PS I, a process called non-cyclic photo-phosphorylation occurs. The two photosystems are connected through an Electron electron transport chain, as seen earlier – in the transport system Z scheme. Both ATP and NADPH + H + are synthesised by this kind of electron flow (Figure 13.5). When only PS I is functional, the electron is Chlorophyll P 700 circulated within the photosystem and the phosphorylation occurs due to cyclic flow of Figure 13.6 Cyclic photophosphorylation electrons (Figure 13.6). A possible location where this could be happening is in the stroma lamellae. While the membrane or lamellae of the grana have both PS I and PS II the stroma lamellae membranes lack PS II as well as NADP reductase enzyme. The excited electron does not pass on to NADP+ but is cycled back to the PS I complex through the electron transport chain (Figure 13.6). The cyclic flow hence, results only in the synthesis of ATP, but not of NADPH + H+. Cyclic photophosphorylation also occurs when only light of wavelengths beyond 680 nm are available for excitation.
 13.6.3 Chemiosmotic Hypothesis Let us now try and understand how actually ATP is synthesised in the chloroplast. The chemiosmotic hypothesis has been put forward to explain the mechanism. Like in respiration, in photosynthesis too, ATP synthesis is linked to development of a proton gradient across a membrane. This time these are the membranes of thylakoid. There is one difference though, here the proton accumulation is towards the inside of the membrane, i.e., in the lumen. In respiration, protons accumulate in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria when electrons move through the ETS (Chapter 14). Let us understand what causes the proton gradient across the membrane. We need to consider again the processes that take place during the activation of electrons and their transport to determine the steps that cause a proton gradient to develop (Figure 13.7). (a) Since splitting of the water molecule takes place on the inner side of the membrane, the protons or hydrogen ions that are produced by the splitting of water accumulate within the lumen of the thylakoids.

The energy so released is utilized by F 1 particle for the synthesis of ATP molecule from ADP. The synthesis of ATP during oxidation of coenzymes is called oxidative phosphorylation. The F1 particles contain 3 coupling factors and ATPase enzyme for the synthesis of ATP. Oxidation of one molecule of reduced coenzyme (NADH 2) results in the formation of 3 ATP molecules while oxidation of FADH2 leads to the synthesis of 2 ATP molecules.,"ATP is synthesised by cells (in mitochondria and Photosystem I chloroplasts) is named phosphorylation.

Molecules of ATP are produced in two ways in glycolysis by: (i) Direct transfer of phosphate from biphosphoglycerate to ADP. (ii) During formation of phosphoenol pyruvate. The phosphate radical picks up energy which helps in the production of ATP. +.,"There are three major ways in which different cells handle pyruvic acid produced by glycolysis. These are lactic acid fermentation, alcoholic fermentation and aerobic respiration. Fermentation takes place under anaerobic conditions in many prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes. For the complete oxidation of glucose to CO2 and H2O, however, organisms adopt Krebs’ cycle which is also called as aerobic respiration. This requires O2 supply.
 synthesise a larger number of ATP molecules needed for cellular metabolism? In eukaryotes these steps take place within the mitochondria and this requires O2. Aerobic respiration is the process that leads to a complete oxidation of organic substances in the presence of oxygen, and releases CO2, water and a large amount of energy present in the substrate. This type of respiration is most common in higher organisms. We will look at these processes in the next section.
 14.4 AEROBIC RESPIRATION For aerobic respiration to take place within the mitochondria, the final product of glycolysis, pyruvate is transported from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria. The crucial events in aerobic respiration are:

In yeast, the anaerobic respiration occurs in fermentation.

Write the significance of citric acid cycle. ,"Significance of citric acid cycle: (i) It explains the process of breaking of pyruvate into CO 2 and water. It is major pathway of generation of ATP.  (ii) More energy is released (24 ATP) in this process, as compared to glycolysis. (iii) In Kreb's cycle, carbon skeletons are obtained for use in growth and maintenance of the cell. Many intermediate compounds are formed. They are used in the synthesis of other biomolecules like amino acids, nucleotides, chlorophyll, cytochromes and fats. Succinyl CoA is the starting molecule for synthesis of chlorophyll. Amino acids are synthesized from aketoglutaric acid, pyruvic acid, and oxaloacetic acid.  3CO2 + 4NADH + 4H+ + FADH2 + ATP","During this process, two molecules of NADH are produced from the metabolism of two molecules of pyruvic acid (produced from one glucose molecule during glycolysis). The acetyl CoA then enters a cyclic pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, more commonly called as Krebs’ cycle after the scientist Hans Krebs who first elucidated it.
 14.4.1 Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle The TCA cycle starts with the condensation of acetyl group with oxaloacetic acid (OAA) and water to yield citric acid (Figure 14.3). The reaction is catalysed by the enzyme citrate synthase and a molecule of CoA is released. Citrate is then isomerised to isocitrate. It is followed by two successive steps of decarboxylation, leading to the formation of α-ketoglutaric acid

 and then succinyl-CoA. In the remaining steps of citric acid cycle, succinyl-CoA is oxidised to OAA allowing the cycle to continue. During the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinic acid a molecule of GTP is synthesised. This is a substrate level phosphorylation. In a coupled reaction GTP is converted to GDP with the simultaneous synthesis of ATP from ADP. Also there are three points in the cycle where NAD+ is reduced to NADH + H+ and one point where FAD + is reduced to FADH 2 . The continued oxidation of acetyl CoA via the TCA cycle requires the continued replenishment of oxaloacetic acid, the first member of the cycle. In addition it also requires regeneration of NAD+ and FAD+ from NADH and FADH2 respectively. The summary equation for this phase of respiration may be written as follows:
 "
What are the two crucial events in anaerobic respiration? Where does these take place?,The two important events in the aerobic respiration are: (i) The complete oxidation of pyruvate by the stepwise removal of all the hydrogen atoms with the release of three molecules of carbon dioxide of three molecules of carbon dioxide. (ii) The passing on of the electrons removed as part of the hydrogen atoms to molecular O 2 along with the synthesis of ATP. The first step takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria while the second step occurs in the inner membrane of mitochondria.,"synthesise a larger number of ATP molecules needed for cellular metabolism? In eukaryotes these steps take place within the mitochondria and this requires O2.

Why anaerobic respiration yields much less energy than aerobic respiration?,Anaerobic respiration yields much less energy than aerobic respiration. The main reasons are: (i) There is incomplete breakdown of respiratory substrate. (ii) One of the end product of anaerobic respiration is organic that still contains energy. (iii) NADH2 produced during glycolysis is often reutilized. (iv) Regeneration of NAD + from NADH2 does not produce ATP. (v) Electron transport chain is absent. (vi) Oxygen is not used for accepting electrons and protons.,"If this energy is to be useful to the cell, it should be able to utilise it to synthesise other molecules that the cell requires. The strategy that the plant cell uses is to catabolise the glucose molecule in such a way that not all the liberated energy goes out as heat. The key is to oxidise glucose not in one step but in several small steps enabling some steps to be just large enough such that the energy released can be coupled to ATP synthesis. How this is done is, essentially, the story of respiration. During the process of respiration, oxygen is utilised, and carbon dioxide, water and energy are released as products. The combustion reaction requires oxygen. But some cells live where oxygen may or may not be available. Can you think of such situations (and organisms) where O2 is not available? There are sufficient reasons to believe that the first cells on this planet lived in an atmosphere that lacked oxygen. Even among present-day living organisms, we know of several that are adapted to anaerobic conditions. Some of these organisms are facultative anaerobes, while in others the requirement for anaerobic condition is obligate. In any case, all living organisms retain the enzymatic machinery to partially oxidise glucose without the help of oxygen. This breakdown of glucose to pyruvic acid is called glycolysis.
 "
What is the significance of Pentose Phosphate pathway?,"The significance of Pentose phosphate pathway are: (i) PPP constitutes an alternate pathway for the breakdown of carbohydrates in respiration. (ii) It produces ribose-5-phosphate, which is used in the synthesis of nucleic acid. (iii) Erythrose-4-phosphate produced in PPP is required for the synthesis of lignin, anthocyanin, IAA and a number of other compounds.  ","14.6 AMPHIBOLIC PATHWAY Glucose is the favoured substrate for respiration. All carbohydrates are usually first converted into glucose before they are used for respiration. Other substrates can also be respired, as has been mentioned earlier, but then they do not enter the respiratory pathway at the first step. See Figure 14.6 to see the points of entry of different substrates in the respiratory pathway. Fats would need to be broken down into glycerol and fatty acids first. If fatty acids were to be respired they would first be degraded to acetyl CoA and enter the pathway. Glycerol would enter the pathway after being converted to PGAL. The proteins would be degraded by proteases and the individual amino acids (after deamination) depending on their structure would enter the pathway at some stage within the Krebs’ cycle or even as pyruvate or acetyl CoA. Since respiration involves breakdown of substrates, the respiratory process has traditionally been considered a catabolic process and the respiratory pathway as a catabolic pathway. But is this understanding correct? We have discussed above, at which points in the respiratory pathway different substrates would enter if they were to be respired and used to derive energy. What is important to recognise is that it is these very compounds that would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for the synthesis of the said substrates. Hence, fatty acids would be broken down to acetyl CoA before entering the respiratory pathway when it is used as a substrate. But when the organism needs to synthesise fatty acids, acetyl CoA would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for it. Hence, the respiratory pathway comes into the picture both during breakdown and synthesis of fatty acids. Similarly, during breakdown and synthesis of protein too, respiratory intermediates form the link. Breaking down processes within the living organism is catabolism, and synthesis is anabolism. Because the respiratory pathway is involved in both anabolism and catabolism, it would hence be better to consider the respiratory pathway as an amphibolic pathway rather than as a catabolic one.

In what form do plants absorb molybdenum from the soil ? List any two role of molybdenum in plants.,"Plants absorb it in the form of molybdate ions MoO4(2-) It is a component of several enzymes, including nitrogenase and nitrate reductase involved in nitrogen metabolism.","SUMMARY Plants obtain their inorganic nutrients from air, water and soil. Plants absorb a wide variety of mineral elements. Not all the mineral elements that they absorb are required by plants. Out of the more than 105 elements discovered so far, less than 21 are essential and beneficial for normal plant growth and development. The elements required in large quantities are called macronutrients while those required in less quantities or in trace are termed as micronutrients. These elements are either essential constituents of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, nucleic acid etc.,

Write the role of boron and copper for the normal activities of plants.,"Role of Boron : It is required for uptake and utilization of Ca2+, membrane functioning, pollen germination, cell elongation, cell differentiation and carbohydrate translocation. Role of Copper : It is essential for overall metabolism of plants. It is associated with certain enzymes involved in redox reactions.","Manganese: It is absorbed in the form of manganous ions (Mn2+). It activates many enzymes involved in photosynthesis, respiration and nitrogen metabolism. The best defined function of manganese is in the splitting of water to liberate oxygen during photosynthesis. Zinc: Plants obtain zinc as Zn2+ ions. It activates various enzymes, especially carboxylases. It is also needed in the synthesis of auxin. Copper: It is absorbed as cupric ions (Cu2+). It is essential for the overall metabolism in plants. Like iron, it is associated with certain enzymes involved in redox reactions and is reversibly oxidised from Cu+ to Cu2+. Boron : It is absorbed as BO3− or B 4O2− . Boron is required for uptake 3 7 2+ and utilisation of Ca , membrane functioning, pollen germination, cell elongation, cell differentiation and carbohydrate translocation.

It 2 ) is a component of several enzymes, including nitrogenase and nitrate reductase both of which participate in nitrogen metabolism. Chlorine: It is absorbed in the form of chloride anion (Cl–). Along with Na+ and K+, it helps in determining the solute concentration and the anioncation balance in cells. It is essential for the water-splitting reaction in photosynthesis, a reaction that leads to oxygen evolution.

How is it decided that the given element is a macronutrient or micronutrient ?,"If an element found in plant is in larger amounts i.e., in excess of 10 mole kg -1 of dry matter, it considered macronutrient. If an element found in plant is in very Small amount i.e., less than 10 mole kg -1 of dry mater, it is considered as micronutrient.","Based upon the above criteria only a few elements have been found to be absolutely essential for plant growth and metabolism. These elements are further divided into two broad categories based on their quantitative requirements. (i) Macronutrients, and (ii) Micronutrients Macronutrients are generally present in plant tissues in large amounts (in excess of 10 mmole Kg –1 of dry matter). The macronutrients include carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulphur, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Of these, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are mainly obtained from CO2 and H2O, while the others are absorbed from the soil as mineral nutrition. Micronutrients or trace elements, are needed in very small amounts (less than 10 mmole Kg –1 of dry matter). These include iron, manganese, copper, molybdenum, zinc, boron, chlorine and nickel. In addition to the 17 essential elements named above, there are some beneficial elements such as sodium, silicon, cobalt and selenium. They are required by higher plants. Essential elements can also be grouped into four broad categories on the basis of their diverse functions. These categories are: (i) Essential elements as components of biomolecules and hence structural elements of cells (e.g., carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen). (ii) Essential elements that are components of energy-related chemical compounds in plants (e.g., magnesium in chlorophyll and phosphorous in ATP). (iii) Essential elements that activate or inhibit enzymes, for example Mg2+ is an activator for both ribulose bisphosphate carboxylaseoxygenase and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase, both of which are critical enzymes in photosynthetic carbon fixation; Zn2+ is an activator of alcohol dehydrogenase and Mo of nitrogenase during nitrogen metabolism. Can you name a few more elements that fall in this category? For this, you will need to recollect some of the biochemical pathways you have studied earlier. (iv) Some essential elements can alter the osmotic potential of a cell. Potassium plays an important role in the opening and closing of stomata. You may recall the role of minerals as solutes in determining the water potential of a cell.

The nitrite is further oxidised to nitrate with the help of the bacterium Nitrobacter. These steps are called nitrification (Figure 12.3). These nitrifying bacteria are chemoautotrophs. The nitrate thus formed is absorbed by plants and is transported to the leaves. In leaves, it is reduced to form ammonia that finally forms the amine group of amino acids. Nitrate present in the soil is also reduced to nitrogen by the process of denitrification. Denitrification is carried by bacteria Pseudomonas and Thiobacillus.

Define deficiency symptoms. What are its importance ?,Deficiency symptoms are externally visible pathological conditions which are produced due to absence or deficiency of some essential nutritive substances. Importance : Deficiency symptoms in relation to particular elements helps the farmer and the farm scientist to recognise the same when they are present in the field or area.  ,"12.2.3 Deficiency Symptoms of Essential Elements Whenever the supply of an essential element becomes limited, plant growth is retarded. The concentration of the essential element below which plant growth is retarded is termed as critical concentration. The element is said to be deficient when present below the critical concentration. Since each element has one or more specific structural or functional role in plants, in the absence of any particular element, plants show certain morphological changes. These morphological changes are indicative of certain element deficiencies and are called deficiency symptoms. The deficiency symptoms vary from element to element and they disappear when the deficient mineral nutrient is provided to the plant. However, if deprivation continues, it may eventually lead to the death of the plant. The parts of the plants that show the deficiency symptoms also depend on the mobility of the element in the plant. For elements that are actively mobilised within the plants and exported to young developing tissues, the deficiency symptoms tend to appear first in the older tissues. For example, the deficiency symptoms of nitrogen, potassium and magnesium are visible first in the senescent leaves. In the older leaves, biomolecules containing these elements are broken down, making these elements available for mobilising to younger leaves. The deficiency symptoms tend to appear first in the young tissues whenever the elements are relatively immobile and are not transported out of the mature organs, for example, element like sulphur and

Why are carbohydrates more suitable for the production of energy?,"In the duodenum pancreatic juice and bile juice are discharged by the pancreas and liver respectively.

Write the difference between lipase and peptidase.,"Hydrochloric acid (HCI) does not act on the wall on the stomach because the wall is covered by mucous, which forms a barrier. The proteolytic enzymes also do not reach the wall because of this factor.","The mucosa of stomach has gastric glands. Gastric glands have three major types of cells namely (i) mucus neck cells which secrete mucus; (ii) peptic or chief cells which secrete the proenzyme pepsinogen; and (iii) parietal or oxyntic cells which secrete HCl and intrinsic factor (factor essential for absorption of vitamin B12). The stomach stores the food for 4-5 hours. The food mixes thoroughly with the acidic gastric juice of the stomach by the churning movements of its muscular wall and is called the chyme. The proenzyme pepsinogen, on exposure to hydrochloric acid gets converted into the active enzyme pepsin, the proteolytic enzyme of the stomach. Pepsin converts proteins into proteoses and peptones (peptides). The mucus and bicarbonates present in the gastric juice play an important role in lubrication and protection of the mucosal epithelium from excoriation by the highly concentrated hydrochloric acid. HCl provides the acidic pH (pH 1.8) optimal for pepsins. Rennin is a proteolytic enzyme found in gastric juice of infants which helps in the digestion of milk proteins. Small amounts of lipases are also secreted by gastric glands. Various types of movements are generated by the muscularis layer of the small intestine. These movements help in a thorough mixing up of the food with various secretions in the intestine and thereby facilitate digestion. The bile, pancreatic juice and the intestinal juice are the secretions released into the small intestine. Pancreatic juice and bile are released through the hepato-pancreatic duct. The pancreatic juice contains inactive enzymes – trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidases, amylases, lipases and nucleases. Trypsinogen is activated by an enzyme, enterokinase, secreted by the intestinal mucosa into active trypsin, which in turn activates the other enzymes in the pancreatic juice. The bile released into the duodenum contains bile pigments (bilirubin and bili-verdin), bile salts, cholesterol and phospholipids but no enzymes. Bile helps in emulsification of fats, i.e., breaking down of the fats into very small micelles. Bile also activates lipases. The intestinal mucosal epithelium has goblet cells which secrete mucus. The secretions of the brush border cells of the mucosa alongwith the secretions of the goblet cells constitute the intestinal juice or succus entericus. This juice contains a variety of enzymes like disaccharidases (e.g., maltase), dipeptidases, lipases, nucleosidases, etc. The mucus alongwith the bicarbonates from the pancreas protects the intestinal mucosa from acid as well as provide an alkaline medium (pH 7.8) for enzymatic activities. Sub-mucosal glands (Brunner’s glands) also help in this.

Write a brief note on physical and mechanical digestion.,"In physical and mechanical digestion, the food is broken down to smaller pieces. Mastication occurs in the mouth and the buccal cavity. Deglutition is common process in the pharynx and the oesophagus. Peristalsis occurs in oesophagus, stomach and colon. Swallowing is done in pharynx and movement of food mass is seen in every part of the alimentary canal. Churning movement is produced in stomach, as well as in intestine.  ","The process of digestion is accomplished by mechanical and chemical processes. The buccal cavity performs two major functions, mastication of food and facilitation of swallowing. The teeth and the tongue with the help of saliva masticate and mix up the food thoroughly. Mucus in saliva helps in lubricating and adhering the masticated food particles into a bolus. The bolus is then conveyed into the pharynx and then into the oesophagus by swallowing or deglutition. The bolus further passes down through the oesophagus by successive waves of muscular contractions called peristalsis. The gastro-oesophageal sphincter controls the passage of food into the stomach.The saliva secreted into the oral cavity contains and enzymes, salivary amylase and electrolytes lysozyme. The chemical process of digestion is initiated in the oral cavity by the hydrolytic action of the carbohydrate splitting enzyme, the salivary

The furrow gradually deepens and ultimately join in the cytoplasm into two. ","10.2.5 Cytokinesis Mitosis accomplishes not only the segregation of duplicated chromosomes into daughter nuclei (karyokinesis), but the cell itself is divided into two daughter cells by the separation of cytoplasm called cytokinesis at the end of which cell division gets completed (Figure 10.2 e). In an animal cell, this is achieved by the appearance of a furrow in the plasma membrane. The furrow gradually deepens and ultimately joins in the centre dividing the cell cytoplasm into two. Plant cells however, are enclosed by a relatively inextensible cell wall, thererfore they undergo cytokinesis by a different mechanism. In plant cells, wall formation starts in the centre of the cell and grows outward to meet the existing lateral walls. The formation of the new cell wall begins with the formation of a simple precursor, called the cell-plate that represents the middle lamella between the walls of two adjacent cells. At the time of cytoplasmic division, organelles like mitochondria and plastids get distributed between the two daughter cells.

What are kinetochores? What is their function?,The kinetochore is a protein structure on chromatids where the spindle fibers attach during ell division to pull sister chromatids apart. Their proteins help to hold the sister chromatids together and also play a role in chromosome editing.,"You may recall that the interphase nucleus has a loose and indistinct network of nucleoprotein fibres called chromatin. But during different stages of cell division, cells show structured chromosomes in place of the nucleus. Chromatin contains DNA and some basic proteins called histones, some non-histone proteins and also RNA. A single human cell has approximately two metre long thread of DNA distributed among its forty six (twenty three pairs) chromosomes. You will study the details of DNA packaging in the form of a chromosome in class XII. Every chromosome (visible only in dividing cells) essentially has a primary constriction or the centromere on the sides of which disc shaped structures called kinetochores are present (Figure 8.12). Centromere holds two chromatids of a chromosome. Based on the position of the centromere, the chromosomes can be classified into four types (Figure 8.13). The metacentric chromosome has middle centromere forming two equal arms of the chromosome. The sub-metacentric chromosome has centromere slightly away from the middle of the chromosome resulting into one shorter arm and one longer arm. In case of acrocentric chromosome the centromere is situated close to its end forming one extremely short and one very long arm, whereas the telocentric chromosome has a terminal centromere.

No.  Metaphase of mitosis  Metaphase I of meiosis  (i)  Each chromosome consists of two chromatids which are held together by centromere.  (ii)  The chromosomes line up in one plane to make up the equatorial plate.  Homologous chromosomes form bivalent. Each bivalent consists of four chromatids and two centromeres. Bivalents become arranged in the plane of the equator forming equatorial plate.  ,"10.2.2 Metaphase The complete disintegration of the nuclear envelope marks the start of the second phase of mitosis, hence the chromosomes are spread through the cytoplasm of the cell. By this stage, condensation of chromosomes is completed and they can be observed clearly under the microscope. This then, is the stage at which morphology of chromosomes is most easily studied. At this stage, metaphase chromosome is made up of two sister chromatids, which are held together by the centromere (Figure 10.2 b). Small disc-shaped structures at the surface of the centromeres are called kinetochores. These structures serve as the sites of attachment of spindle fibres (formed by the spindle fibres) to the chromosomes that are moved into position at the centre of the cell. Hence, the metaphase is characterised by all the chromosomes coming to lie at the equator with one chromatid of each chromosome connected by its kinetochore to spindle fibres from one pole and its sister chromatid connected by its kinetochore to spindle fibres from the opposite pole (Figure 10.2 b). The plane of alignment of the chromosomes at metaphase is referred to as the metaphase plate. The key features of metaphase are: l
 Chromosomes are moved to spindle equator and get aligned along metaphase plate through spindle fibres to both poles.
 10.2.3 Anaphase At the onset of anaphase, each chromosome arranged at the metaphase plate is split simultaneously and the two daughter chromatids, now referred to as daughter chromosomes of the future daughter nuclei, begin their migration towards the two opposite poles. As each chromosome moves away from the equatorial plate, the centromere of each chromosome remains directed towards the pole and hence at the leading edge, with the arms of the chromosome trailing behind Figure 10.2 a and b : A diagrammatic (Figure 10.2 c).

It also plays an important role in amoeboid locomotion found in certain protozoans (𝑒. 𝑔. , 𝐴𝑚𝑜𝑒𝑏𝑎) and white blood corpuscles.","Some specialised cells in our body like macrophages and leucocytes in blood exhibit amoeboid movement. It is effected by pseudopodia formed by the streaming of protoplasm (as in Amoeba). Cytoskeletal elements like microfilaments are also involved in amoeboid movement. Ciliary movement occurs in most of our internal tubular organs which are lined by ciliated epithelium. The coordinated movements of cilia in the trachea help us in removing dust particles and some of the foreign substances inhaled alongwith the atmospheric air. Passage of ova through the female reproductive tract is also facilitated by the ciliary movement. Movement of our limbs, jaws, tongue, etc, require muscular movement. The contractile property of muscles are effectively used for locomotion and other movements by human beings and majority of multicellular organisms. Locomotion requires a perfect coordinated activity of muscular, skeletal and neural systems. In this chapter, you will learn about the types of muscles, their structure, mechanism of their contraction and important aspects of the skeletal system.

What is pericardium and how it is helpful to humans ?,"It is two layered sac consisting of outer parietal pericardium and inner visceral pericardium. in between the two layers, a space called the pericardial cavity is present which is filled with a pericardial fluid. Significance: The pericardium protects the heart from shocks and mechanical injuries and also allows free movement of the heart.","18.3.1 Human Circulatory System Human circulatory system, also called the blood vascular system consists of a muscular chambered heart, a network of closed branching blood vessels and blood, the fluid which is circulated. Heart, the mesodermally derived organ, is situated in the thoracic cavity, in between the two lungs, slightly tilted to the left. It has the size of a clenched fist. It is protected by a double walled membranous bag, pericardium, enclosing the pericardial fluid. Our heart has four chambers, two relatively small upper chambers called atria and two larger lower chambers called ventricles. A thin, muscular wall called the interatrial septum separates the right and the left atria, whereas a thick-walled, the inter-ventricular septum, separates the left and the right ventricles (Figure 18.2). The atrium and the ventricle of the same side are also separated by a thick fibrous tissue called the atrio-ventricular septum. However, each of these septa are provided with an opening through which the two chambers of the same side are connected.

"While blood of earthworm and human being is red in colour, even then they are considered different. How ?","This difference is due to the location of hemoglobin as. In earthworm, it is present in dissolved form in plasma whereas in humans, in it is present in R.B.Cs.","7.3 EARTHWORM Earthworm is a reddish brown terrestrial invertebrate that inhabits the upper layer of the moist soil. During day time, they live in burrows made by boring and swallowing the soil. In the gardens, they can be traced by their faecal deposits known as worm castings. The common Indian earthworms are Pheretima and Lumbricus.
 7.3.1 Morphology Earthworms have long cylindrical body. The body is divided into more than hundred short segments which are similar (metameres about 100-120 in number). The dorsal surface of the body is marked by a dark median mid dorsal line (dorsal blood vessel) along the longitudinal axis of the body. The ventral surface is distinguished by the presence of genital openings (pores). Anterior end consists of the mouth and the prostomium, a lobe which serves as a covering for the mouth and as a wedge to force open cracks in the soil into which the earthworm may crawl. The prostomium is sensory in function. The first body segment is called the peristomium (buccal segment) which contains the mouth. In a mature worm, segments
 Sensory system does not have eyes but does possess light and touch sensitive organs (receptor cells) to distinguish the light intensities and to feel the vibrations in the ground. Worms have specialised chemoreceptors (taste receptors) which react to chemical stimuli. These sense organs are located on the anterior part of the worm. Earthworm is hermaphrodite (bisexual), i.e., testes and ovaries are present in the same individual (Figure 7.13). There are two pairs of testes present in the 10th and 11th segments. Their vasa deferentia run up to the 18th segment where they join the prostatic duct. Two pairs of accessory glands are present one pair each in the 17th and 19th segments. The common prostate and spermatic duct (vasa deferentia) opens to the exterior by a pair of male genital pores on the ventro-lateral side of the 18th segment. Four pairs of spermathecae are located in 6th-9th segments (one pair in each segment). They receive and store spermatozoa during copulation. One pair of ovaries is attached at the inter-segmental septum of the 12th and 13th segments. Ovarian funnels are present beneath the ovaries which continue into oviduct, join together and open on the ventral side as a single median female genital pore on the 14th segment. A mutual exchange of sperm occurs between two worms during mating. One worm has to find another worm and they mate juxtaposing opposite gonadal openings exchanging packets of sperms called spermatophores. Mature sperm and egg cells and nutritive fluid are deposited in cocoons produced by the gland cells of clitellum. Fertilisation and development occur within the Figure 7.13 Reproductive system of earthworm cocoons which are deposited in soil. The ova (eggs) are fertilised by the sperm cells within the cocoon which then slips off the worm and is deposited in or on the soil. The cocoon holds the worm embryos. After about 3 weeks, each cocoon produces two to twenty baby worms with an average of four. Development of earthworms is direct, i.e., there is no larva formed.

What is systemic circulation ?,The circulation of blood between heart and body is called systemic circulation. The left ventricle pumps the oxygenated blood into aorta which gives off arteries to all parts of the body except lungs.,"18.4 DOUBLE CIRCULATION The blood flows strictly by a fixed route through Blood Vessels—the arteries and veins. Basically, each artery and vein consists of three layers: an inner lining of squamous endothelium, the tunica intima, a middle layer of smooth muscle and elastic fibres, the tunica media, and an external layer of fibrous connective tissue with collagen fibres, the tunica externa. The tunica media is comparatively thin in the veins (Figure 18.4). As mentioned earlier, the blood pumped by the right ventricle enters the pulmonary artery, whereas the left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta. The deoxygenated blood pumped into the pulmonary artery is passed on to the lungs from where the oxygenated blood is carried by the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. This pathway constitutes the pulmonary circulation. The oxygenated blood entering the aorta is carried by a network of arteries, arterioles and capillaries to the tissues from where the deoxygenated blood is collected by a system of venules, veins and vena cava and emptied into the right atrium. This is the systemic circulation (Figure 18.4). The systemic circulation provides nutrients, O2 and other essential substances to the tissues and takes CO2 and other harmful substances away for elimination.

What is cardiac output ?   ,"The amount of blood pumped by heart per minute is called cardiac output or heart output. Heart of normal person beats 72 times per minute and pumps out about 70 milli litres of blood per beat. Thus the cardiac output is 72 x 70 or 5040 milli litres per minute. i.e., about 5 litres per minute.","18.3.1 Human Circulatory System Human circulatory system, also called the blood vascular system consists of a muscular chambered heart, a network of closed branching blood vessels and blood, the fluid which is circulated.

What is stroke volume ? How is it related to cardiac output ?  (DDE 2017) ,"During cardiac cycle or one heart beat, the volume of blood pumped by the heart is called stroke volume. This is normally 70 ml. The amount of blood pumped by heart per minute is called cardiac output. It is the product of stroke volume and the number of heart beats.","CARDIAC ACTIVITY
 Normal activities of the heart are regulated intrinsically, i.e., auto regulated by specialised muscles (nodal tissue), hence the heart is called myogenic. A special neural centre in the medulla oblangata can moderate the cardiac function through autonomic nervous system (ANS). Neural signals through the sympathetic nerves (part of ANS) can increase the rate of heart beat, the strength of ventricular contraction and thereby the cardiac output. On the other hand, parasympathetic neural signals (another component of ANS) decrease the rate of heart beat, speed of conduction of action potential and thereby the cardiac output. Adrenal medullary hormones can also increase the cardiac output.

Which portal system is present in man ? Write its two advantages.,"Hepatic portal system is present in man. It has the following significance : (i) The blood which comes from the alimentary canal contains digested food like glucose and amino acids. The excess of glucose is converted into glycogen which is stored in the liver for later use. When an individual feels deficiency of food, the glycogen is converted into glucose and is transferred to the blood stream via hepatic veins. (ii) Harmful nitrogenous waste like ammonia is converted into urea which is later removed by kidneys. Thus the blood is detoxified (purified) of harmful nitrogenous waste.","hepatic portal system.

Write a short note on pulmonary circulation.,(i) The flow of deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs and the return of oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium is called the pulmonary circulation.  (ii) The pulmonary trunk arises from the right ventricle and then divides into the right pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery which supply deoxygenated blood to the right and left lung respectively. (iii) Exchange of gases takes place in the lungs. Two pulmonary veins from each lung transport the oxygenated blood to the left atrium.,"the body surface by using electrocardiograph and the recording is called electrocardiogram (ECG) which is of clinical importance. We have a complete double circulation, i.e., two circulatory pathways, namely, pulmonary and systemic are present. The pulmonary circulation starts by the pumping of deoxygenated blood by the right ventricle which is carried to the lungs where it is oxygenated and returned to the left atrium. The systemic circulation starts with the pumping of oxygenated blood by the left ventricle to the aorta which is carried to all the body tissues and the deoxygenated blood from there is collected by the veins and returned to the right atrium. Though the heart is autoexcitable, its functions can be moderated by neural and hormonal mechanisms.

(iv) Ethylene accelerates abscission in flowers and fruits and is used for thinning of fruits like cotton, cherry etc.","leaves, chloroplasts in leaves, lateral shoot growth and adventitious shoot formation. Cytokinins help overcome the apical dominance. They promote nutrient mobilisation which helps in the delay of leaf senescence. 15.4.3.4 Ethylene Ethylene is a simple gaseous PGR. It is synthesised in large amounts by tissues undergoing senescence and ripening fruits. Influences of ethylene on plants include horizontal growth of seedlings, swelling of the axis and apical hook formation in dicot seedlings. Ethylene promotes senescence and abscission of plant organs especially of leaves and flowers. Ethylene is highly effective in fruit ripening. It enhances the respiration rate during ripening of the fruits. This rise in rate of respiration is called respiratory climactic. Ethylene breaks seed and bud dormancy, initiates germination in peanut seeds, sprouting of potato tubers. Ethylene promotes rapid internode/petiole elongation in deep water rice plants. It helps leaves/ upper parts of the shoot to remain above water. Ethylene also promotes root growth and root hair formation, thus helping the plants to increase their absorption surface. Ethylene is used to initiate flowering and for synchronising fruit-set in pineapples. It also induces flowering in mango. Since ethylene regulates so many physiological processes, it is one of the most widely used PGR in agriculture. The most widely used compound as source of ethylene is ethephon. Ethephon in an aqueous solution is readily absorbed and transported within the plant and releases ethylene slowly. Ethephon hastens fruit ripening in tomatoes and apples and accelerates abscission in flowers and fruits (thinning of cotton, cherry, walnut). It promotes female flowers in cucumbers thereby increasing the yield. 15.4.3.5 Abscisic acid As mentioned earlier, abscisic acid (ABA) was discovered for its role in regulating abscission and dormancy. But like other PGRs, it also has other wide ranging effects on plant growth and development. It acts as a general plant growth inhibitor and an inhibitor of plant metabolism. ABA inhibits seed germination. ABA stimulates the closure of stomata and increases the tolerance of plants to various kinds of stresses. Therefore, it is also called the stress hormone. ABA plays an important role in seed development, maturation and dormancy. By inducing dormancy, ABA helps seeds to withstand desiccation and other factors unfavourable for growth. In most situations, ABA acts as an antagonist to GAs. We may summarise that for any and every phase of growth, differentiation and development of plants, one or the other PGR has some role to play. Such roles could be complimentary or antagonistic. These could be individualistic or synergistic.

Does it make any difference to have the haemoglobin in the corpuscles rather than in plasma ? Explain.,"There is great difference in respects of efficiency of carrying the oxygen from respiratory organs to the body tissue as follows : S. No. (i)  Haemoglobin in corpuscles As RBC are small, rounded and in more in quantity, so haemoglobin is exposed with large combined surface area to absorb O 2.  (ii)  When RBC pass through the small capillaries of respiratory organs, one by one, they have ample time and surface, to absorb oxygen.  Haemoglobin in plasma In plasma, the exposed surface area for haemoglobin is very limited in comparison to the RBC, the result is the absorption of O 2 in less amount. The haemoglobin dissolved in plasma has lesser time as it pass quickly, (being liquid) through the box of capillaries. ","lining whereas the inner pleural membrane is in contact with the lung surface. The part starting with the external nostrils up to the terminal bronchioles constitute the conducting part whereas the alveoli and their ducts form the respiratory or exchange part of the respiratory system. The conducting part transports the atmospheric air to the alveoli, clears it from foreign particles, humidifies and also brings the air to body temperature. Exchange part is the site of actual diffusion of O2 and CO2 between blood and atmospheric air. The lungs are situated in the thoracic chamber which is anatomically an air-tight chamber. The thoracic chamber is formed dorsally by the vertebral column, ventrally by the sternum, laterally by the ribs and on the lower side by the dome-shaped diaphragm. The anatomical setup of lungs in thorax is such that any change in the volume of the thoracic cavity will be reflected in the lung (pulmonary) cavity. Such an arrangement is essential for breathing, as we cannot directly alter the pulmonary volume. Respiration involves the following steps: (i) Breathing or pulmonary ventilation by which atmospheric air is drawn in and CO2 rich alveolar air is released out. (ii) Diffusion of gases (O2 and CO2) across alveolar membrane. (iii) Transport of gases by the blood. (iv) Diffusion of O2 and CO2 between blood and tissues. (v) Utilisation of O2 by the cells for catabolic reactions and resultant release of CO2 (cellular respiration as dealt in the Chapter 14).

Why lymph acts as middle man of the body ?,"(i) Lymph acts as a ""middle man"" which transports oxygen, food materials, hormones, etc., to the body cells and brings carbon dioxide and other metabolic wastes, from the body cells to blood and then finally pours the same into the venous system. Body cells are kept moist by the lymph. (ii) Lymph capillaries present in the intestinal villi are called lacteals which are associated with absorption and transportation of fat and fat soluble vitamins.","18.2 LYMPH (TISSUE FLUID) As the blood passes through the capillaries in tissues, some water along with many small water soluble substances move out into the spaces between the cells of tissues leaving the larger proteins and most of the formed elements in the blood vessels. This fluid released out is called the interstitial fluid or tissue fluid. It has the same mineral distribution as that in plasma. Exchange of nutrients, gases, etc., between the blood and the cells always occur through this fluid. An elaborate network of vessels called the lymphatic system collects this fluid and drains it back to the major veins. The fluid present in the lymphatic system is called the lymph. Lymph is a colourless fluid containing specialised lymphocytes which are responsible for the immune responses of the body. Lymph is also an important carrier for nutrients, hormones, etc. Fats are absorbed through lymph in the lacteals present in the intestinal villi.

(iíi) Tunica interna : It is the innermost coat which is made up of two parts. (1) Elastic membrane is made up of elastic tissue of yellow fibres. It is thicker in artery. (2) Endothelium is made up of flattened squamous epithelial cells lining the lumen. (3) Its cells are more elongated in artery. (4) Blood capillaries consist of endothelium only. ,"The smooth muscle fibres taper at both ends (fusiform) and do not show striations (Figure 7.7b). Cell junctions hold them together and they are bundled together in a connective tissue sheath. The wall of internal organs such as the blood vessels, stomach and intestine contains this type of muscle tissue. Smooth muscles are ‘involuntary’ as their functioning cannot be directly controlled. We usually are not able to make it contract merely by thinking about it as we can do with skeletal muscles. Cardiac muscle tissue is a contractile tissue present only in the heart. Cell junctions fuse the plasma membranes of cardiac muscle cells and make them stick together (Figure 7.7c). Communication junctions (intercalated discs) at some fusion points allow the cells to contract as a unit, i.e., when one cell receives a signal to contract, its neighbours are also stimulated to contract.

The ventricles now relax (ventricular diastole) and the ventricular pressure falls causing the closure of semilunar valves which prevents the backflow of blood into the ventricles. As the ventricular pressure declines further, the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are pushed open by the pressure in the atria exerted by the blood which was being emptied into them by the veins. The blood now once again moves freely to the ventricles. The ventricles and atria are now again in a relaxed (joint diastole) state, as earlier. Soon the SAN generates a new action potential and the events described above are repeated in that sequence and the process continues. This sequential event in the heart which is cyclically repeated is called the cardiac cycle and it consists of systole and diastole of both the atria and ventricles. As mentioned earlier, the heart beats 72 times per minute, i.e., that many cardiac cycles are performed per minute. From this it could be deduced that the duration of a cardiac cycle is 0.8 seconds. During a cardiac cycle, each ventricle pumps out approximately 70 mL of blood which is called the stroke volume. The stroke volume multiplied by the heart rate (no. of beats per min.) gives the cardiac output. Therefore, the cardiac output can be defined as the volume of blood pumped out by each ventricle per minute and averages 5000 mL or 5 litres in a healthy individual. The body has the ability to alter the stroke volume as well as the heart rate and thereby the cardiac output. For example, the cardiac output of an athlete will be much higher than that of an ordinary man. During each cardiac cycle two prominent sounds are produced which can be easily heard through a stethoscope. The first heart sound (lub) is associated with the closure of the tricuspid and bicuspid valves whereas the second heart sound (dub) is associated with the closure of the semilunar valves. These sounds are of clinical diagnostic significance.
 18.3.3 Electrocardiograph (ECG) You are probably familiar with this scene from a typical hospital television show: A patient is hooked up to a monitoring machine that shows voltage traces on a screen and makes the sound “... pip... pip... pip..... peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee” as the patient goes into cardiac arrest. This type of machine (electro-cardiograph) is used to obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG). ECG is a graphical representation of the electrical activity of the heart during a cardiac cycle. To obtain a standard ECG (as shown in the
 18.6 DISORDERS OF CIRCULATORY SYSTEM High Blood Pressure (Hypertension): Hypertension is the term for blood pressure that is higher than normal (120/80). In this measurement 120 mm Hg (millimetres of mercury pressure) is the systolic, or pumping, pressure and 80 mm Hg is the diastolic, or resting, pressure. If repeated checks of blood pressure of an individual is 140/90 (140 over 90) or

Describe the three types of valves present in the human heart ?,"Valves in heart: (i) In the heart there are a number of openings through which blood passes from one chamber to another.  (ii) These openings are guarded by certain valves which regulate the flow of blood in desired direction. The bicuspid valves and tricuspid valves are present guarding the auriculoventricular apertures in between the auricles and ventricles on the left and right sides respectively. These valves open into the ventricles and prevent the back flow of the blood. (iii) A set of semilunar valves are also present at the base of aorta in the ventricle. These allows the blood to flow only in direction of an aorta, when the left ventricle contracts.","pulmonary artery and the aorta respectively are provided with the semilunar valves. The valves in the heart allows the flow of blood only in one direction, i.e., from the atria to the ventricles and from the ventricles to the pulmonary artery or aorta. These valves prevent any backward flow. The entire heart is made of cardiac muscles. The walls of ventricles are much thicker than that of the atria. A specialised cardiac musculature called the nodal tissue is also distributed in the heart (Figure 18.2). A patch of this tissue is present in the right upper corner of the right atrium called the sino-atrial node (SAN). Another mass of this tissue is seen in the lower left corner of the right atrium close to the atrio-ventricular septum called the atrio-ventricular node (AVN). A bundle of nodal fibres, atrioventricular bundle (AV bundle) continues from the AVN which passes through the atrio-ventricular septa to emerge on the top of the interventricular septum and immediately divides into a right and left bundle. These branches give rise to minute fibres throughout the ventricular musculature of the respective sides and are called purkinje fibres. The nodal musculature has the ability to generate action potentials without any external stimuli, i.e., it is autoexcitable. However, the number of action potentials that could be generated in a minute vary at different parts of the nodal system. The SAN can generate the maximum number of action potentials, i.e., 70-75 min–1, and is responsible for initiating and maintaining the rhythmic contractile activity of the heart. Therefore, it is called the pacemaker. Our heart normally beats 70-75 times in a minute (average 72 beats min–1).
 18.3.2 Cardiac Cycle How does the heart function? Let us take a look. To begin with, all the four chambers of heart are in a relaxed state, i.e., they are in joint diastole. As the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are open, blood from the pulmonary veins and vena cava flows into the left and the right ventricle respectively through the left and right atria. The semilunar valves are closed at this stage. The SAN now generates an action potential which stimulates both the atria to undergo a simultaneous contraction – the atrial systole. This increases the flow of blood into the ventricles by about 30 per cent. The action potential is conducted to the ventricular side by the AVN and AV bundle from where the bundle of His transmits it through the entire ventricular musculature. This causes the ventricular muscles to contract, (ventricular systole), the atria undergoes relaxation (diastole), coinciding with the ventricular systole. Ventricular systole increases the ventricular pressure causing the closure of tricuspid and
 bicuspid valves due to attempted backflow of blood into the atria. As the ventricular pressure increases further, the semilunar valves guarding the pulmonary artery (right side) and the aorta (left side) are forced open, allowing the blood in the ventricles to flow through these vessels into the circulatory pathways. The ventricles now relax (ventricular diastole) and the ventricular pressure falls causing the closure of semilunar valves which prevents the backflow of blood into the ventricles. As the ventricular pressure declines further, the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are pushed open by the pressure in the atria exerted by the blood which was being emptied into them by the veins.

Mention the functions of the three types of granulocytes ?,"The functions of the three types of granulocytes are as follows: (i) Eosinophils : They resist infections and are associated with allergic reactions. (ii) Basophils: They release histamine, serotonin, etc. are involved in inflammatory reactions. (iii) Neutrophils : They are phagocytic in nature and destroy foreign organisms entering the body.","associated with allergic reactions. Lymphocytes (20-25 per cent) are of two major types – ‘B’ and ‘T’ forms. Both B and T lymphocytes are responsible for immune responses of the body. Platelets also called thrombocytes, are cell fragments produced from megakaryocytes (special cells in the bone marrow). Blood normally contains 1,500,00-3,500,00 platelets mm–3. Platelets can release a variety of substances most of which are involved in the coagulation or clotting of blood. A reduction in their number can lead to clotting disorders which will lead to excessive loss of blood from the body.
 "
What are nodal tissues ? Explain their role in heart beat.,"The heart beat results from a wave of electrical potential called the cardiac impulse, which originates from nodal tissue like sinu-atrial node (SAN), auricular ventricular node (AVN), bundle of His and Purkinje fibres. Functions : (i) SAN is located in the right auricle at the opening of the vena cavae. It is the part of the conducting system of heart. The stimulation arises initially in the sinu -atrial node. (ii) The AVN is located in the right auricle in the inter- auricular septum. It gives rise to bundle of His, a muscular bridge that conducts stimulation from the auricles to the ventricles. (ii) The bundle of His divides into two branches. The terminal branches of the conducting system are represented by a network of Purkinje fibres which convey stimuli to the myocardium.","pulmonary artery and the aorta respectively are provided with the semilunar valves. The valves in the heart allows the flow of blood only in one direction, i.e., from the atria to the ventricles and from the ventricles to the pulmonary artery or aorta.

 the body surface by using electrocardiograph and the recording is called electrocardiogram (ECG) which is of clinical importance. We have a complete double circulation, i.e., two circulatory pathways, namely, pulmonary and systemic are present. The pulmonary circulation starts by the pumping of deoxygenated blood by the right ventricle which is carried to the lungs where it is oxygenated and returned to the left atrium. The systemic circulation starts with the pumping of oxygenated blood by the left ventricle to the aorta which is carried to all the body tissues and the deoxygenated blood from there is collected by the veins and returned to the right atrium. Though the heart is autoexcitable, its functions can be moderated by neural and hormonal mechanisms.

Heart, the mesodermally derived organ, is situated in the thoracic cavity, in between the two lungs, slightly tilted to the left. It has the size of a clenched fist. It is protected by a double walled membranous bag, pericardium, enclosing the pericardial fluid. Our heart has four chambers, two relatively small upper chambers called atria and two larger lower chambers called ventricles. A thin, muscular wall called the interatrial septum separates the right and the left atria, whereas a thick-walled, the inter-ventricular septum, separates the left and the right ventricles (Figure 18.2). The atrium and the ventricle of the same side are also separated by a thick fibrous tissue called the atrio-ventricular septum. However, each of these septa are provided with an opening through which the two chambers of the same side are connected. The opening between the right atrium and the right ventricle is guarded by a valve formed of three muscular flaps or cusps, the tricuspid valve, whereas a bicuspid or mitral valve guards the opening between the left atrium and the left ventricle. The openings of the right and the left ventricles into the

Who reported the ABO blood grouping in human beings for the first time? What is the basis for this grouping.,"Karl Landsteiner reported for the first time ABO blood groups in human being. This grouping is based on the presence or absence of two antigens on the RBC's namely A and B. In a blood transfusion, the blood of a donor has to be matched with the blood of a recipient as transfusion of mismatched blood groups leads to agglutination of blood.","18.1.3 Blood Groups As you know, blood of human beings differ in certain aspects though it appears to be similar. Various types of grouping of blood has been done. Two such groupings – the ABO and Rh – are widely used all over the world. 18.1.3.1 ABO grouping ABO grouping is based on the presence or absence of two surface antigens (chemicals that can induce immune response) on the RBCs namely A and B. Similarly, the plasma of different individuals contain two natural antibodies (proteins produced in response to antigens). The distribution of antigens and antibodies in the four groups of blood, A, B, AB and O are given in Table 18.1. You probably know that during blood transfusion, any blood cannot be used; the blood of a donor has to be carefully matched with the blood of a recipient before any blood transfusion to avoid severe problems of clumping (destruction of RBC).

Their number is approx. 5000-8000 per mm3. They are colourless. There is no respiratory pigment in them. Have an important role in defence and immunity of body. ,"18.1.2 Formed Elements Erythrocytes, leucocytes and platelets are collectively called formed elements (Figure 18.1) and they constitute nearly 45 per cent of the blood. Erythrocytes or red blood cells (RBC) are the most abundant of all the cells in blood. A healthy adult man has, on an average, 5 millions to 5.5 millions of RBCs mm–3 of blood. RBCs are formed in the red bone marrow in the adults. RBCs are devoid of nucleus in most of the mammals and are biconcave in shape. They have a red coloured, iron containing complex protein called haemoglobin, hence the colour and name of these cells. A healthy individual has 12-16 gms of haemoglobin in every 100 ml of blood. These molecules play a significant role in transport of respiratory gases. RBCs have an average life span of 120 days after which they are destroyed in the spleen (graveyard of RBCs). Leucocytes are also known as white blood cells (WBC) as they are colourless due to the lack of haemoglobin. They are nucleated and are relatively lesser in number which averages 6000-8000 mm–3 of blood. Leucocytes are generally short lived. We have two main categories of WBCs – granulocytes and agranulocytes. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils are different types of granulocytes, while lymphocytes and monocytes are the agranulocytes. Neutrophils are the most abundant cells (60-65 per cent) of the total WBCs and basophils are the least (0.5-1 per cent) among them. Neutrophils and monocytes (6-8 per cent) are phagocytic cells which destroy foreign organisms entering the body. Basophils secrete histamine, serotonin, heparin, etc., and are involved in inflammatory reactions. Eosinophils (2-3 per cent) resist infections and are also

What are the important functions of the circulatory system ?,"(i) The circulatory system supplies food, oxygen, enzymes, hormones and other substances to the different cells of the body. (ii) It carries the end products of metabolism to the organs which excrete them. (iii) It provides a strong defence to the body in prevention against invasion of infectious microorganisms. (iv) It maintains body temperature, homeostasis of the tissue fluids and acid base balance. ","You have learnt that all living cells have to be provided with nutrients, O2 and other essential substances. Also, the waste or harmful substances produced, have to be removed continuously for healthy functioning of tissues. It is therefore, essential to have efficient mechanisms for the movement of these substances to the cells and from the cells. Different groups of animals have evolved different methods for this transport. Simple organisms like sponges and coelenterates circulate water from their surroundings through their body cavities to facilitate the cells to exchange these substances. More complex organisms use special fluids within their bodies to transport such materials. Blood is the most commonly used body fluid by most of the higher organisms including humans for this purpose. Another body fluid, lymph, also helps in the transport of certain substances. In this chapter, you will learn about the composition and properties of blood and lymph (tissue fluid) and the mechanism of circulation of blood is also explained herein.

How does the blood flow through the heart during the different phases of the cardiac cycle ?,"The action of the human heart consists of a series of events, which follow one another with great rapidity. Main events in cardiac cycle are: (i) Auricular systole, (ii) Ventricular systole and (iii) Joint diastole. Thus, we can say that the contraction of the heart and its relaxation constitute cardiac cycle or heart beat. The duration of the cardiac cycle varies inversely with the cardiac rate. The heartbeat is 72 times per minute in man. Single heartbeat lasts for 0.8 of a second. In such heart beats, blood comes to heart and then is propelled from auricles to ventricles and then to arteries. The number of heartbeats per minute is very much influenced by age, size, sex, temperature.","18.3.2 Cardiac Cycle How does the heart function? Let us take a look. To begin with, all the four chambers of heart are in a relaxed state, i.e., they are in joint diastole. As the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are open, blood from the pulmonary veins and vena cava flows into the left and the right ventricle respectively through the left and right atria. The semilunar valves are closed at this stage. The SAN now generates an action potential which stimulates both the atria to undergo a simultaneous contraction – the atrial systole. This increases the flow of blood into the ventricles by about 30 per cent. The action potential is conducted to the ventricular side by the AVN and AV bundle from where the bundle of His transmits it through the entire ventricular musculature. This causes the ventricular muscles to contract, (ventricular systole), the atria undergoes relaxation (diastole), coinciding with the ventricular systole. Ventricular systole increases the ventricular pressure causing the closure of tricuspid and

Explain the disorders of circulatory system.,"The improper functioning of the heart may lead to certain disorders such as (i) Hypertension : A continuous or sustained rise in the arterial blood pressure is known as hypertension. The normal pressure in a healthy individual is 120/80mmHg. But increase in the blood pressure beyond 140/90mmHg is referred to as hypertension. High blood pressure can harm the vital organs. It compels the heart to work excessively, due to which congestive heart disease may set in. (ii) Coronary heart disease : (CAD) : It is also known as atherosclerosis. It affects the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart muscles. This is due to the deposition of fat, cholesterol and Ca+ and fibrous tissues on the walls of the arteries which results in the narrowing of the arterial lumen. (iii) Angina : It is also known as ""angina pectoris"" The symptom is acute chest pain. When adequate quantity of oxygen do not reach the heart muscles pain occurs. (iv) Heart failure : It is the state of heart which is not able to pump the blood effectively enough to meet the body needs. As congestion of the lungs is the main reason for this heart failure it is also known as congestive heart failure  ","higher, it shows hypertension. High blood pressure leads to heart diseases and also affects vital organs like brain and kidney. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Coronary Artery Disease, often referred to as atherosclerosis, affects the vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle. It is caused by deposits of calcium, fat, cholesterol and fibrous tissues, which makes the lumen of arteries narrower. Angina: It is also called ‘angina pectoris’. A symptom of acute chest pain appears when no enough oxygen is reaching the heart muscle. Angina can occur in men and women of any age but it is more common among the middle-aged and elderly. It occurs due to conditions that affect the blood flow. Heart Failure: Heart failure means the state of heart when it is not pumping blood effectively enough to meet the needs of the body. It is sometimes called congestive heart failure because congestion of the lungs is one of the main symptoms of this disease. Heart failure is not the same as cardiac arrest (when the heart stops beating) or a heart attack (when the heart muscle is suddenly damaged by an inadequate blood supply).
 "
Discuss briefly about any one neurotransmitter.,"We sense the changes in our environment (both internal and external) with the help of special sensory receptors. These environmental changes, called stimuli, once detected by the special sensory cells, are conveyed to the brain in the form of nerve impulses. The meaning of each stimulus is interpreted in the brain and appropriate order is sent to the body parts for its appropriate response to ensure well being.","You must have experienced a sudden withdrawal of a body part which comes in contact with objects that are extremely hot, cold pointed or animals that are scary or poisonous. The entire process of response to a peripheral nervous stimulation, that occurs involuntarily, i.e., without conscious effort or thought and requires the involvment of a part of the central nervous system is called a reflex action. The reflex pathway comprises at least one afferent neuron (receptor) and one efferent (effector or excitor) neuron appropriately arranged in a series (Figure 21.5). The afferent neuron receives signal from a sensory organ and transmits the impulse via a dorsal nerve root into the CNS (at the level of spinal cord). The efferent nueuron then carries signals from CNS to the effector. The stimulus and response thus forms a reflex arc as shown below in the knee jerk reflex. You should carefully study Figure 21.5 to understand the mechanism of a knee jerk reflex.
 Figure 21.5 Diagrammatic presentation of reflex action (showing knee jerk reflex)
 21.6 SENSORY RECEPTION AND PROCESSING Have you ever thought how do you feel the climatic changes in the environment? How do you see an object and its colour? How do you hear a sound? The sensory organs detect all types of changes in the environment and send appropriate signals to the CNS, where all the inputs are processed and analysed. Signals are then sent to different parts/ centres of the brain. This is how you can sense changes in the environment.

 How does ear convert sound waves into neural impulses, which are sensed and processed by the brain enabling us to recognise a sound ? The external ear receives sound waves and directs them to the ear drum. The ear drum vibrates in response to the sound waves and these vibrations are transmitted through the ear ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) to the oval window. The vibrations are passed through the oval window on to the fluid of the cochlea, where they generate waves in the lymphs. The waves in the lymphs induce a ripple in the basilar membrane. These movements of the basilar membrane bend the hair cells, pressing them against the tectorial membrane. As a result, nerve impulses are generated in the associated afferent neurons. These impulses are transmitted by the afferent fibres via auditory nerves to the auditory cortex of the brain, where the impulses are analysed and the sound is recognised.
 SUMMARY The neural system coordinates and integrates functions as well as metabolic and homeostatic activities of all the organs. Neurons, the functional units of neural system are excitable cells due to a differential concentration gradient of ions across the membrane. The electrical potential difference across the resting neural membrane is called the ‘resting potential’. The nerve impulse is conducted along the axon membrane in the form of a wave of depolarisation and repolarisation. A synapse is formed by the membranes of a pre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron which may or may not be separated by a gap called synaptic cleft. Chemicals involved in the transmission of impulses at chemical synapses are called neurotransmitters. Human neural system consists of two parts : (i) central neural system (CNS) and (ii) the peripheral neural system. The CNS consists of the brain and spiral cord. The brain can be divided into three major parts : (i) forebrain, (ii) midbrain and (iii) hindbrain. The forebrain consists of cerebrum, thalamus and hypothalamus. The cerebrum is longitudinally divided into two halves that are connected by the corpus callosum. A very important part of the forebrain called hypothalamus controls the body temperature, eating and drinking. Inner parts

Which type of sensory receptor are eyes and ears made up of?,They are made up of the special sensory receptors called the photoreceptors and the auditory receptors respectively.,"itself continues forward to form a pigmented and opaque structure called the iris which is the visible coloured portion of the eye. The eye ball contains a transparent crystalline lens which is held in place by ligaments attached to the ciliary body. In front of the lens, the aperture surrounded by the iris is called the pupil. The diameter of the pupil is regulated by the muscle fibres of iris. The inner layer is the retina and it contains three layers of neural cells – from inside to outside – ganglion cells, bipolar cells and photoreceptor cells. There are two types of photoreceptor cells, namely, rods and cones. These cells contain the light-sensitive proteins called the photopigments. The daylight (photopic) vision and colour vision are functions of cones and the twilight (scotopic) vision is the function of the rods. The rods contain a purplish-red protein called the rhodopsin or visual purple, which contains a derivative of Vitamin A. In the human eye, there are three types of cones which possess their own characteristic photopigments that respond to red, green and blue lights. The sensations of different colours are produced by various combinations of these cones and their photopigments. When these cones are stimulated equally, a sensation of white light is produced. The optic nerves leave the eye and the retinal blood vessels enter it at a point medial to and slightly above the posterior pole of the eye ball. Photoreceptor cells are not present in that region and hence it is called the blind spot. At the posterior pole of the eye lateral to the blind spot, there is a yellowish pigmented spot called macula lutea with a central pit called the fovea. The fovea is a thinned-out portion of the retina where only the cones are densely packed. It is the point where the visual acuity (resolution) is the greatest. The space between the cornea and the lens is called the aqueous chamber and contains a thin watery fluid called aqueous humor. The space between the lens and the retina is called the vitreous chamber and is filled with a transparent gel called vitreous humor. 21.6.1.2 Mechanism of Vision The light rays in visible wavelength focussed on the retina through the cornea and lens generate potentials (impulses) in rods and cones.

(ii) It is a thinned-out portion of the retina that is devoid of rods and blood vessels and has cones cells only. It is the place of most distinct vision.  ","21.6.1 Eye Our paired eyes are located in sockets of the skull called orbits. A brief account of structure and functions of the human eye is given in the following sections. 21.6.1.1
 Parts of an eye
 Parts of an eye
 The adult human eye ball is nearly a spherical structure. The wall of the eye ball is composed of three layers (Figure 21.6). The external layer is composed of a dense connective tissue and is called the sclera. The anterior portion of this layer is called the cor nea. The middle layer, choroid, contains many blood vessels and looks bluish in colour. The choroid layer is thin over the posterior two-thirds of the eye ball, but it becomes thick in the anterior part to form the ciliary body. The ciliary body

 Figure 21.6 Diagram showing parts of an eye
 itself continues forward to form a pigmented and opaque structure called the iris which is the visible coloured portion of the eye. The eye ball contains a transparent crystalline lens which is held in place by ligaments attached to the ciliary body. In front of the lens, the aperture surrounded by the iris is called the pupil. The diameter of the pupil is regulated by the muscle fibres of iris. The inner layer is the retina and it contains three layers of neural cells – from inside to outside – ganglion cells, bipolar cells and photoreceptor cells. There are two types of photoreceptor cells, namely, rods and cones. These cells contain the light-sensitive proteins called the photopigments. The daylight (photopic) vision and colour vision are functions of cones and the twilight (scotopic) vision is the function of the rods. The rods contain a purplish-red protein called the rhodopsin or visual purple, which contains a derivative of Vitamin A. In the human eye, there are three types of cones which possess their own characteristic photopigments that respond to red, green and blue lights. The sensations of different colours are produced by various combinations of these cones and their photopigments. When these cones are stimulated equally, a sensation of white light is produced. The optic nerves leave the eye and the retinal blood vessels enter it at a point medial to and slightly above the posterior pole of the eye ball. Photoreceptor cells are not present in that region and hence it is called the blind spot. At the posterior pole of the eye lateral to the blind spot, there is a yellowish pigmented spot called macula lutea with a central pit called the fovea. The fovea is a thinned-out portion of the retina where only the cones are densely packed. It is the point where the visual acuity (resolution) is the greatest. The space between the cornea and the lens is called the aqueous chamber and contains a thin watery fluid called aqueous humor. The space between the lens and the retina is called the vitreous chamber and is filled with a transparent gel called vitreous humor. 21.6.1.2 Mechanism of Vision The light rays in visible wavelength focussed on the retina through the cornea and lens generate potentials (impulses) in rods and cones. As mentioned earlier, the photosensitive compounds (photopigments) in the human eyes is composed of opsin (a protein) and retinal (an aldehyde of vitamin A). Light induces dissociation of the retinal from opsin resulting in changes in the structure of the opsin. This causes membrane permeability changes. As a result, potential differences are generated in the photoreceptor cells. This produces a signal that generates action potentials in the ganglion cells through the bipolar cells. These action potentials (impulses) are transmitted by the optic nerves to the visual

Why locomotion is helpful to animals?,"Locomotion is helpful to animals and enables them to: (i) shift from unfavourable environment to favourable conditions. (ii) go in search of food, water and shelter. (iii) find its partner for reproduction and proper place for laying eggs or giving birth to young ones. (iv) Prevents from getting captured by predators.","LOCOMOTION AND MOVEMENT

What do you understand by threshold stimulus for muscle contraction?,"(i) For contraction, muscle fibre always require a specific minimum strength or intensity of the stimulus or nerve impulse. This is called threshold stimulus. (ii) If the stimulus or the nerve impulse is below this intensity the muscles fail to contract.","Muscle contraction is initiated by a signal sent by the central nervous system (CNS) via a motor neuron. A motor neuron alongwith the muscle fibres connected to it constitute a motor unit. The junction between a motor neuron and the sarcolemma of the muscle fibre is called the neuromuscular junction or motor-end plate. A neural signal reaching this junction releases a neurotransmitter (Acetyl choline) which generates an action potential in the sarcolemma. This spreads through the muscle fibre and causes the release of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. Increase in Ca++ level leads to the binding of calcium with a subunit of troponin on actin filaments and thereby remove the masking of active sites for myosin. Utilising the energy from ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head now binds to the exposed active sites on actin to form a cross bridge (Figure 20.4). This
 Figure 20.4 Stages in cross bridge formation, rotation of head and breaking of cross bridge
 pulls the attached actin filaments towards the centre of ‘A’ band. The ‘Z’ line attached to these actins are also pulled inwards thereby causing a shortening of the sarcomere, i.e., contraction. It is clear from the above steps, that during shortening of the muscle, i.e., contraction, the ‘I’ bands get reduced, whereas the ‘A’ bands retain the length (Figure 20.5). The myosin, releasing the ADP and P1 goes back to its relaxed state. A new ATP binds and the cross-bridge is broken (Figure 20.4). The ATP is again hydrolysed by the myosin head and the cycle of cross bridge formation

Write about the two types of endoskeleton in humans.,"The two types of endoskeleton are: (i) Axial skeleton: It is present on the median longitudinal axis of the body. It consists of skull, vertebral column, sternum and ribs. (ii) Appendicular skeleton: It is situated at the lateral sides which actually extends outwards from the principal axis. It consists of pectoral and pelvic girdles and bones of arms and legs.","Endoderm

What are the functions of skull?,The important functions of skull are: (i) It protects the brain by keeping it in the cranium. (ii) It bears jaws which help the animal for cutting and masticating the food. (iii) It also protects and supports the sense organs. (iv) It provides the rigid walls of a respiratory passage through which air is inhaled into the lungs.,"The brain is the central information processing organ of our body, and acts as the ‘command and control system’. It controls the voluntary movements, balance of the body, functioning of vital involuntary organs (e.g., lungs, heart, kidneys, etc.), thermoregulation, hunger and thirst, circadian (24-hour) rhythms of our body, activities of several endocrine glands and human behaviour. It is also the site for processing of vision, hearing, speech, memory, intelligence, emotions and thoughts. The human brain is well protected by the skull. Inside the skull, the brain is covered by cranial meninges consisting of an outer layer called dura mater, a very thin middle layer called arachnoid and an inner layer (which is in contact with the brain tissue) called pia mater. The brain can be divided into three major parts: (i) forebrain, (ii) midbrain, and (iii) hindbrain (Figure 21.4).

(iii) The bones of the skeletal system protects delicate internal organs of the body.  (iv) It provides attachment surface for the body muscle, tendons and other similar things and thus helps in movement. (v) With its help locomotion is performed.","20.3 SKELETAL SYSTEM Skeletal system consists of a framework of bones and a few cartilages. This system has a significant role in movement shown by the body. Imagine chewing food without jaw bones and walking around without the limb bones. Bone and cartilage are specialised connective tissues. The former has a very hard matrix due to calcium salts in it and the latter has slightly pliable matrix due to chondroitin salts. In human beings, this system is made up of 206 bones and a few cartilages. It is grouped into two principal divisions – the axial and the appendicular skeleton. Axial skeleton comprises 80 bones distributed along the main axis of the body. The skull, vertebral column, sternum and ribs constitute axial skeleton. The skull (Figure 20.6) is composed of two sets of bones – Frontal bone

A cup shaped bone called patella cover the knee ventrally (knee cap). Pectoral and Pelvic girdle bones help in the articulation of the upper and the lower limbs respectively with the axial skeleton. Each girdle is formed of two halves. Each half of pectoral girdle consists of a clavicle and a scapula (Figure 20.9). Scapula is a large triangular flat bone situated in the dorsal part of the thorax between the second and the seventh ribs. The dorsal, flat, triangular body of scapula has a slightly elevated ridge called the spine which projects as a flat, expanded process called the acromion. The clavicle articulates with this. Below the acromion is a depression called the glenoid cavity which articulates with the head of the humerus to form the shoulder joint. Each clavicle is a long slender bone with two curvatures. This bone is commonly called the collar bone. Pelvic girdle consists of two coxal bones (Figure 20.10). Each coxal bone is formed by the fusion of three bones – ilium, ischium and pubis. At the point of fusion of the above bones is a cavity called acetabulum to which the thigh bone articulates. The two halves of the pelvic girdle meet ventrally to form the pubic symphysis containing fibrous cartilage.

(iii) The relaxation of the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles returns the diaphragm and sternum to their normal positions and decreases the volume of the thoracic cavity and subsequently, pressure in the lungs increases. (iv) To equalise this pressure, the air from the lungs rushes out through the respiratory passage to bring out expiration.","sternum causing an increase in the volume of the thoracic chamber in the dorso-ventral axis. The overall increase in the thoracic volume causes a similar increase in pulmonary volume. An increase in pulmonary volume decreases the intra-pulmonary pressure to less than the atmospheric pressure which forces the air from outside to move into the lungs, i.e., inspiration (Figure 17.2a). Relaxation of the diaphragm and the inter-costal muscles returns the diaphragm and sternum to their normal positions and reduce the thoracic volume and thereby the pulmonary volume. This leads to an increase in intra-pulmonary pressure to slightly above the atmospheric pressure causing the expulsion of air from the lungs, i.e., expiration (Figure 17.2b). We have the ability to increase the strength of inspiration and expiration with the help of additional muscles in the abdomen. On an average, a healthy human breathes 12-16 times/minute. The volume of air involved in breathing movements can be estimated by using a spirometer which helps in clinical assessment of pulmonary functions.

State the route of foul air from the lungs to the outside ?,The route followed by foul air from the lungs to outside is as follows: Alveoli → Alveolar duct Bronchioles → Bronchi → Trachea → Larynx → Glottis → Pharynx → Internal nares → Nasal chambers → External nares → Atmosphere.,"17.1.1 Human Respiratory System We have a pair of external nostrils opening out above the upper lips. It leads to a nasal chamber through the nasal passage. The nasal chamber opens into the pharynx, a portion of which is the common passage for food and air. The pharynx opens through the larynx region into the trachea. Larynx is a cartilaginous box which helps in sound production and hence called the sound box. During swallowing glottis can be covered by a thin elastic cartilaginous flap called epiglottis to prevent the entry of food into the larynx. Trachea is a straight tube extending up to the mid-thoracic cavity, which divides at the level of 5th thoracic vertebra into a right and left primary bronchi. Each bronchi undergoes repeated divisions to form the secondary and tertiary bronchi and bronchioles ending up in very thin terminal bronchioles. The tracheae, primary, secondary and tertiary bronchi, and initial bronchioles are supported by incomplete cartilaginous rings. Each terminal bronchiole gives rise to a number of very thin, irregular-walled and vascularised bag-like structures called alveoli. The branching network of bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli comprise the lungs (Figure 17.1). We have two lungs which are covered by a double layered pleura, with pleural fluid between them. It reduces friction on the lung-surface. The outer pleural membrane is in close contact with the thoracic Epiglottis Larynx Trachea

How does air play a vital role in the production of voice ? On what factors the quality of sound depends ?,"Sound is produced by the vocal cords. When expired air is passed through the true vocal cords under pressure from the lungs, the vocal cords are set into vibration which results in the production of sound. Factors: The pitch of a sound is determined by the tension on the vocal cords-the greater the tension, the higher the pitch. The quality of voice depends on the resonators above the larynx, namely the pharynx, mouth and paranasal sinuses. ","Mechanism of Hearing
 How does ear convert sound waves into neural impulses, which are sensed and processed by the brain enabling us to recognise a sound ? The external ear receives sound waves and directs them to the ear drum. The ear drum vibrates in response to the sound waves and these vibrations are transmitted through the ear ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) to the oval window. The vibrations are passed through the oval window on to the fluid of the cochlea, where they generate waves in the lymphs. The waves in the lymphs induce a ripple in the basilar membrane. These movements of the basilar membrane bend the hair cells, pressing them against the tectorial membrane. As a result, nerve impulses are generated in the associated afferent neurons. These impulses are transmitted by the afferent fibres via auditory nerves to the auditory cortex of the brain, where the impulses are analysed and the sound is recognised.

Inspiratory muscles and expiratory muscles play very important role in respiratory process. (DDE 2017),The contraction of the external inter costal muscles and diaphragm leads to increase in volume of thoracic cavity. An increase in pulmonary volume decreases the intra-pulmonary pressure to less than atmospheric pressure. Thus forcing air into the lungs from outside. This is inspiration. Relaxation of the diaphragm and the inter-costal muscles returns the diaphragm and the sternum to their normal positions and reduce the thoracic volume and thereby the pulmonary volume.

What are the two factors that contribute towards the dissociation of oxyhaemoglobin in the arterial blood to release molecular oxygen in an active tissue?,"The two factors that contributes towards the dissociation of oxyhaemoglobin in the arterial blood to release molecular oxygen in an active tissue are, (i) Lower concentration of pO 2 and (ii) Higher concentration of pCO 2.","17.4.1 Transport of Oxygen Haemoglobin is a red coloured iron containing pigment present in the RBCs. O2 can bind with haemoglobin in a reversible manner to form oxyhaemoglobin. Each haemoglobin molecule can carry a maximum of four molecules of O2. Binding of oxygen with haemoglobin is primarily related to partial pressure of O2. Partial pressure of CO2, hydrogen ion concentration and temperature are the other factors which can interfere with this binding. A sigmoid curve is obtained when percentage saturation of haemoglobin with O2 is plotted against the pO 2 . This curve is called the Oxygen dissociation curve (Figure 17.5) and is highly useful in studying the effect of factors like pCO2, H+ concentration, etc., on binding of O2 100 with haemoglobin. In the alveoli, where there is high pO2, low pCO2, lesser H+ concentration 80 and lower temperature, the factors are all favourable for the formation of 60 oxyhaemoglobin, whereas in the tissues, where low pO 2 , high pCO 2 , high H + 40 concentration and higher temperature exist, the conditions are favourable for dissociation 20 of oxygen from the oxyhaemoglobin.

What is partial pressure ? how does it help in gaseous exchange during respiration ?,"The pressure exerted by an individual gas in a mixture of gases is called partial pressure. It is directly proportional to its concentration in a mixture It is expressed as PO 2, PCO2, etc. A gas diffuses across a membrane from the side where its partial pressure is higher to the side where it is lower. In lungs, PO 2 is higher in alveolar air than in blood capillaries, so O2 diffuses from lungs into the blood. Sometime PCO 2 is higher in blood than in alveoli and hence it diffuses out.","At the tissue site where partial pressure of CO2 is high due to catabolism, CO2 diffuses into blood (RBCs and plasma) and forms HCO3– and H+,. At the alveolar site where pCO2 is low, the reaction proceeds in the opposite direction leading to the formation of CO2 and H2O. Thus, CO2 trapped as bicarbonate at the tissue level and transported to the alveoli is released out as CO2 (Figure 17.4). Every 100 ml of deoxygenated blood delivers approximately 4 ml of CO2 to the alveoli.

Write short notes on hind brain. ,"The structural classification of neurons depends upon the number of dendrites extending from the cell body. (i) Multipolar neurons have one axon and several dendrites; the majority of neurons in the spinal cord and brain are multipolar. (ii) Bipolar neurons have only two processes: a single dendrite and an axon. Biopolar neurons are found in the sense organs-and in the retina of the eye and in olfactory cells. (iii) Unipolar neurons lack dendrites and have a single axon, and are also sensory neurons.","A neuron is a microscopic structure composed of three major parts, namely, cell body, dendrites and axon (Figure 21.1). The cell body contains cytoplasm with typical cell organelles and certain granular bodies called Nissl’s granules. Short fibres which branch repeatedly and project out of the cell body also
 contain Nissl’s granules and are called dendrites. These fibres transmit impulses towards the cell body. The axon is a long fibre, the distal end of which is branched. Each branch terminates as a bulb-like structure called synaptic knob which possess synaptic vesicles containing chemicals called neurotransmitters. The axons transmit nerve impulses away from the cell body to a synapse or to a neuro-muscular junction. Based on the number of axon and dendrites, the neurons are divided into three types, i.e., multipolar (with one axon and two or more dendrites; found in the cerebral cortex), bipolar (with one axon and one dendrite, found in the retina of eye) and unipolar (cell body with one axon only; found usually in the embryonic stage). There are two types of axons, namely, myelinated and nonmyelinated. The myelinated nerve fibres are enveloped with Schwann cells, which form a myelin sheath around the axon. The gaps between two adjacent myelin sheaths are called nodes of Ranvier. Myelinated nerve fibres are found in spinal and cranial nerves. Unmyelinated nerve fibre is enclosed by a Schwann cell that does not form a myelin sheath around the axon, and is commonly found in autonomous and the somatic neural systems.

What are the different parts of fore brain?,The nervous system of higher animals performs three basic functions: (i) They receive sensory input from internal and external environment by nerves. (ii) They process the input information; and (iii) They respond to the stimuli transmitting motor commands to determine the response of the body parts or cells.,"21.1 NEURAL SYSTEM The neural system of all animals is composed of highly specialised cells called neurons which can detect, receive and transmit different kinds of stimuli. The neural organisation is very simple in lower invertebrates. For example, in Hydra it is composed of a network of neurons. The neural system is better organised in insects, where a brain is present along with a number of ganglia and neural tissues. The vertebrates have a more developed neural system.
 21.2 HUMAN NEURAL SYSTEM The human neural system is divided into two parts : (i) the central neural system (CNS) (ii) the peripheral neural system (PNS) The CNS includes the brain and the spinal cord and is the site of information processing and control. The PNS comprises of all the nerves of the body associated with the CNS (brain and spinal cord). The nerve fibres of the PNS are of two types : (a) afferent fibres (b) efferent fibres The afferent nerve fibres transmit impulses from tissues/organs to the CNS and the efferent fibres transmit regulatory impulses from the CNS to the concerned peripheral tissues/organs. The PNS is divided into two divisions called somatic neural system and autonomic neural system. The somatic neural system relays impulses from the CNS to skeletal muscles while the autonomic neural system transmits impulses from the CNS to the involuntary organs and smooth muscles of the body. The autonomic neural system is further classified into sympathetic neural system and parasympathetic neural system. Visceral nervous system is the part of the peripheral nervous system that comprises the whole complex of nerves, fibres, ganglia, and plexuses by which impulses travel from the central nervous system to the viscera and from the viscera to the central nervous system.

Hence it is called ""thermostat"" of the body. It keeps body temperature at roughly 37°C by means of a complex thermostat system. (v) It is also associated with behavioural activities. (vi) Appetite and thirst centres are located in the hypothalamus.","22.2.1 The Hypothalamus
 As you know, the hypothalamus is the basal part of diencephalon, forebrain (Figure 22.1) and it regulates a wide spectrum of body functions. It contains Figure 22.1 Location of endocrine glands several groups of neurosecretory cells called nuclei which produce hormones. These hormones regulate the synthesis and secretion of pituitary hormones. However, the hormones produced by hypothalamus are of two types, the releasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary hormones) and the inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of pituitary hormones). For example a hypothalamic hormone called Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates the pituitary synthesis and release of gonadotrophins. On the other hand, somatostatin from the hypothalamus inhibits the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. These hormones originating in the hypothalamic neurons, pass through axons and are released from their nerve endings. These hormones reach the pituitary gland through a portal circulatory system and regulate the functions of the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is under the direct neural regulation of the hypothalamus (Figure 22.2).

However, the hormones produced by hypothalamus are of two types, the releasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary hormones) and the inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of pituitary hormones). For example a hypothalamic hormone called Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates the pituitary synthesis and release of gonadotrophins. On the other hand, somatostatin from the hypothalamus inhibits the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. These hormones originating in the hypothalamic neurons, pass through axons and are released from their nerve endings. These hormones reach the pituitary gland through a portal circulatory system and regulate the functions of the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is under the direct neural regulation of the hypothalamus (Figure 22.2).
 Hypothalamus
 The Pituitary Gland
 Hypothalamic The pituitary gland is located in a bony cavity neurons called sella tursica and is attached to hypothalamus by a stalk (Figure 22.2). It is divided anatomically into an adenohypophysis and a neurohypophysis. Adenohypophysis consists of two portions, pars distalis and pars intermedia. The pars distalis region of pituitary, commonly called anterior pituitary, produces growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid Portal circulation stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle Posterior stimulating hormone (FSH). Pars intermedia pituitary secretes only one hormone called melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH). However, in Anterior humans, the pars intermedia is almost merged pituitary with pars distalis. Neurohypophysis (pars nervosa) also known as posterior pituitary, stores Figure 22.2 Diagrammatic representation of pituitary and its relationship with and releases two hormones called oxytocin and hypothalamus vasopressin, which are actually synthesised by the hypothalamus and are transported axonally to neurohypophysis. Over-secretion of GH stimulates abnormal growth of the body leading to gigantism and low secretion of GH results in stunted growth resulting in pituitary dwarfism. Excess secretion of growth hormone in adults especially in middle age can result in severe disfigurement (especially of the face) called Acromegaly, which may lead to serious complications, and premature death if unchecked. The disease is hard to diagnose in the early stages and often goes undetected for many years, until changes in external features become noticeable. Prolactin regulates the growth of the mammary glands and formation of milk in them. TSH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. ACTH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones called glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. LH and FSH stimulate gonadal activity and hence are called gonadotrophins. In males, LH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of hormones called androgens from testis. In males, FSH and androgens regulate spermatogenesis. In females, LH induces ovulation of fully mature follicles (graafian follicles) and maintains the corpus luteum, formed from the remnants of the graafian follicles

"What is the difference between unipolar, bipolar and multipolar neurons? Give one example of each.","Middle ear: The middle ear contains three ossicles called malleus, incus and stapes which are attached to one another in a chain-like fashion. The malleus is attached to the  tympanic membrane and the stapes is attached to the oval window of the cochlea. The ear ossicles increase the efficiency of transmission of sound waves to the inner ear. Eustachian tube help in equalising the pressure of either side of ear drum.","21.6.2 The Ear The ears perform two sensory functions, hearing and maintenance of body balance. Anatomically, the ear can be divided into three major sections called the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear (Figure 21.7). The outer ear consists of the pinna and external auditory meatus (canal). The pinna collects the vibrations in the air which produce sound. The external auditory meatus leads inwards and extends up to the tympanic membrane (the ear drum). There are very fine hairs and wax-secreting glands in the skin of the pinna and the meatus. The tympanic membrane is composed of Figure 21.7 Diagrammatic view of ear connective tissues covered with skin outside and with mucus membrane inside. The middle ear contains three ossicles called malleus, incus and stapes which are attached to one another in a chain-like fashion. The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane and the stapes is attached to the oval window of the cochlea. The ear ossicles increase the efficiency of transmission of sound waves to the inner ear. An Eustachian tube connects the middle ear cavity with the pharynx. The Eustachian tube helps in equalising the pressures on either sides of the ear drum. The fluid-filled inner ear called labyrinth consists of two parts, the bony and the membranous labyrinths. The bony labyrinth is a series of channels. Inside these channels lies the membranous labyrinth, which is surrounded by a fluid called perilymph. The membranous labyrinth is filled with a fluid called endolymph. The coiled portion of the labyrinth is called cochlea. The membranes constituting cochlea, the reissner’s and basilar, divide the surounding perilymph filled bony labyrinth into an upper scala vestibuli and a lower scala tympani (Figure 21.8). The space
 within cochlea called scala media is filled with endolymph. At the base of the cochlea, the scala vestibuli ends at the oval window, while the scala tympani terminates at the round window which opens to the middle ear.
 Figure 21.8 Diagrammatic representation of the sectional view of cochlea
 The organ of corti is a structure located on the basilar membrane which contains hair cells that act as auditory receptors. The hair cells are present in rows on the internal side of the organ of corti. The basal end of the hair cell is in close contact with the afferent nerve fibres. A large number of processes called stereo cilia are projected from the apical part of each hair cell. Above the rows of the hair cells is a thin elastic membrane called tectorial membrane. The inner ear also contains a complex system called vestibular apparatus, located above the cochlea. The vestibular apparatus is composed of three semi-circular canals and the otolith (macula is the sensory part of saccule and utricle). Each semi-circular canal lies in a different plane at right angles to each other. The membranous canals are suspended in the perilymph of the bony canals. The base of canals is

Name the two humours found inside the mammalian eye. List the functions they perform.,"The path travelled by an impulse in a reflex action is called the reflex arc. It consists of five parts: (i) A receptor or skin, the neurons of which start a sensory impulse. (ii) An afferent nerve, which brings sensory impulse from the receptor to the central nervous system. (iii) The neurons present in the spinal cord change the sensory impulse into the motor impulse. (iv) An efferent nerve, which carries the motor impulses from the spinal cord to the specific effectors like muscles fibres or gland cells.

 REFLEX ARC
 You must have experienced a sudden withdrawal of a body part which comes in contact with objects that are extremely hot, cold pointed or animals that are scary or poisonous. The entire process of response to a peripheral nervous stimulation, that occurs involuntarily, i.e., without conscious effort or thought and requires the involvment of a part of the central nervous system is called a reflex action. The reflex pathway comprises at least one afferent neuron (receptor) and one efferent (effector or excitor) neuron appropriately arranged in a series (Figure 21.5). The afferent neuron receives signal from a sensory organ and transmits the impulse via a dorsal nerve root into the CNS (at the level of spinal cord). The efferent nueuron then carries signals from CNS to the effector. The stimulus and response thus forms a reflex arc as shown below in the knee jerk reflex. You should carefully study Figure 21.5 to understand the mechanism of a knee jerk reflex.

Where does mitosis take place in plants and animals? What is its significance in multicellular organisms?. ,"It takes place both in somatic and reproductive cells of the plants and animals. In multicellular organisms, mitosis produces more cells for growth and repair. Mitosis division is responsible for growth and development of a single-celled zygote into a multicellular organism. Mitosis division helps in maintaining the proper size. Mitosis also helps in restoring wear and tear in body tissues, replacing damaged or lost part, healing wounds and regeneration of detached parts.","Significance of Mitosis
 Mitosis or the equational division is usually restricted to the diploid cells only. However, in some lower plants and in some social insects haploid cells also divide by mitosis. It is very essential to understand the significance of this division in the life of an organism. Are you aware of some examples where you have studied about haploid and diploid insects? Mitosis usually results in the production of diploid daughter cells with identical genetic complement. The growth of multicellular organisms is due to mitosis. Cell growth results in disturbing the ratio between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. It therefore becomes essential for the cell to divide to restore the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio. A very significant contribution of mitosis is cell repair. The cells of the upper layer of the epidermis, cells of the lining of the gut, and blood cells are being constantly replaced. Mitotic divisions in the meristematic tissues – the apical and the lateral cambium, result in a continuous growth of plants throughout their life.

Draw a labelled diagram of anaphase of mitosis. Write any two key features of this phase.   ,"Two key features are: (i) Fibres uniting chromosomes with poles of spindle starts contraction until daughter chromosomes are completely distinct from one another. Contraction of fibres pulls the groups of chromosomes further apart to their respective poles. (ii) The chromosomes move to their poles through cytoplasm.  Fig. The behaviours of chromosomes at late anaphase n relation to chromosomal, polar and interzonal spindle fibres","10.2.2 Metaphase The complete disintegration of the nuclear envelope marks the start of the second phase of mitosis, hence the chromosomes are spread through the cytoplasm of the cell. By this stage, condensation of chromosomes is completed and they can be observed clearly under the microscope. This then, is the stage at which morphology of chromosomes is most easily studied. At this stage, metaphase chromosome is made up of two sister chromatids, which are held together by the centromere (Figure 10.2 b). Small disc-shaped structures at the surface of the centromeres are called kinetochores. These structures serve as the sites of attachment of spindle fibres (formed by the spindle fibres) to the chromosomes that are moved into position at the centre of the cell. Hence, the metaphase is characterised by all the chromosomes coming to lie at the equator with one chromatid of each chromosome connected by its kinetochore to spindle fibres from one pole and its sister chromatid connected by its kinetochore to spindle fibres from the opposite pole (Figure 10.2 b). The plane of alignment of the chromosomes at metaphase is referred to as the metaphase plate. The key features of metaphase are: l
 Spindle fibres attach to kinetochores of chromosomes.

As each chromosome moves away from the equatorial plate, the centromere of each chromosome remains directed towards the pole and hence at the leading edge, with the arms of the chromosome trailing behind Figure 10.2 a and b : A diagrammatic (Figure 10.2 c).

(ii) In animal cell, division of cytoplasm likes by cleavage while in plant cell, division of cytoplasm takes place by cell-plate formation. (iii) In plants & new cell wall is fashioned between the new daughter cells, while in animal cells the cell membrane constricts to pinch the parent cell into daughter cells.","10.2.5 Cytokinesis Mitosis accomplishes not only the segregation of duplicated chromosomes into daughter nuclei (karyokinesis), but the cell itself is divided into two daughter cells by the separation of cytoplasm called cytokinesis at the end of which cell division gets completed (Figure 10.2 e). In an animal cell, this is achieved by the appearance of a furrow in the plasma membrane. The furrow gradually deepens and ultimately joins in the centre dividing the cell cytoplasm into two. Plant cells however, are enclosed by a relatively inextensible cell wall, thererfore they undergo cytokinesis by a different mechanism. In plant cells, wall formation starts in the centre of the cell and grows outward to meet the existing lateral walls. The formation of the new cell wall begins with the formation of a simple precursor, called the cell-plate that represents the middle lamella between the walls of two adjacent cells. At the time of cytoplasmic division, organelles like mitochondria and plastids get distributed between the two daughter cells.

What are the factors controlling cell division?,"Factors controlling cell division are: (i) Cell size: Cells capable of division attain a particular size and then undergo division. (ii) Karyoplasmic ratio: Rise in cell volume disturbs karyoplasmic ratio. It stimulates the cell to divide. (iii) Mitogens: Mitogens, are agents, factors or substances that trigger cell division.","CELL CYCLE AND CELL DIVISION

"Differentiate between (i) S-phase and G2 phase, (ii) G1 phase and G2 phase.","(i) Meiosis: Meiosis is a double division that takes place in a diploid cell (2N) and involves reduction of chromosome number to half and forms four haploid cells. It reduces number of chromosomes to half. So it is popularly termed as the reduction division.  (ii) Amitosis : It is a simple method of cell division, also called direct cell division. In this, there is no differentiation of chromosomes and spindle. Nuclear envelope does not degenerate. Nucleus elongates and constricts in middle to form two daughter nuclei. It is followed by a centripetal constriction of cytoplasm to form 2 daughter cells. (iii) G2 phase (second growth phase) : It is also called pre-mitotic gap phase. It has double DNA content as compared to original cell (4C:2C). It produces macromolecules (RNAs, proteins) for multiplication of organelles, spindle formation and cell growth. G phase prepares a cell to undergo division.","10.4 MEIOSIS The production of offspring by sexual reproduction includes the fusion of two gametes, each with a complete haploid set of chromosomes. Gametes are formed from specialised diploid cells. This specialised kind of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half results in the production of haploid daughter cells. This kind of division is called meiosis. Meiosis ensures the production of haploid phase in the life cycle of sexually reproducing organisms whereas fertilisation restores the diploid phase. We come across meiosis during gametogenesis in plants and animals. This leads to the formation of haploid gametes. The key features of meiosis are as follows: l l l

 Meiosis involves two sequential cycles of nuclear and cell division called meiosis I and meiosis II but only a single cycle of DNA replication. Meiosis I is initiated after the parental chromosomes have replicated to produce identical sister chromatids at the S phase.

As each chromosome moves away from the equatorial plate, the centromere of each chromosome remains directed towards the pole and hence at the leading edge, with the arms of the chromosome trailing behind Figure 10.2 a and b : A diagrammatic (Figure 10.2 c). Thus, anaphase stage is characterised by view of stages in mitosis
 Anaphase I: The homologous chromosomes separate, while sister chromatids remain associated at their centromeres (Figure 10.3). Telophase I: The nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear, cytokinesis follows and this is called as dyad of cells (Figure 10.3). Although in many cases the chromosomes do undergo some dispersion, they do not reach the extremely extended state of the interphase nucleus. The stage between the two meiotic divisions is called interkinesis and is generally short lived. There is no replication of DNA during interkinesis. Interkinesis is followed by prophase II, a much simpler prophase than prophase I.
 10.4.2 Meiosis II Prophase II: Meiosis II is initiated immediately after cytokinesis, usually before the chromosomes have fully elongated. In contrast to meiosis I, meiosis II resembles a normal mitosis. The nuclear membrane disappears by the end of prophase II (Figure 10.4). The chromosomes again become compact. Metaphase II: At this stage the chromosomes align at the equator and the microtubules from opposite poles of the spindle get attached to the kinetochores (Figure 10.4) of sister chromatids. Anaphase II: It begins with the simultaneous splitting of the centromere of each chromosome (which was holding the sister chromatids together), allowing them to move toward opposite poles of the cell (Figure 10.4) by shortening of microtubules attached to kinetochores.
 "
How do cytokinesis takes place in plants?,"In plants cytokinesis takes by two methods: (a) Cleavage method: This method occurs in lower plants. Cytoplasm undergo centripetal constriction in the middle to form two daughter protoplasts, each having a single nucleus. In furrow, pectin hemicellulose and microfibrils of cellulose are deposited to form a double wall. (b) Cell plate method: In this case, the spindle persists for some time, known as phragmoplast. Small vesicles produced by golgi apparatus collect at the equator of the phragmoplast. The membrane of vesicles fuse to form film which solidifies to form cell plate.","10.2.5 Cytokinesis Mitosis accomplishes not only the segregation of duplicated chromosomes into daughter nuclei (karyokinesis), but the cell itself is divided into two daughter cells by the separation of cytoplasm called cytokinesis at the end of which cell division gets completed (Figure 10.2 e).

What is the necessity of meiosis II in meiosis inspite of the reduction division of meiosis I?,"At the end of Meiosis-I, two groups of chromosomes are produced, with each group having half the number of chromosomes present in the parent nucleus, therefore meiosis-I is called reductional division. But each chromosome is still a dyad i.e., formed of two sister chromatids joined at the common centromere. Though the chromosome number has been halved, each chromosome still has double (2N) amount of DNA. So there is need of meiosis-II during which sister chromatids of  each chromosome separate into different cells. Haploidy occurs even in DNA amount. The main purpose of meiosis-II is to separate genetically chromosomes formed during crossing over in meiosis-I.","10.4 MEIOSIS The production of offspring by sexual reproduction includes the fusion of two gametes, each with a complete haploid set of chromosomes.

These studies would require correct classification and identification of organisms. Identification of organisms requires intensive laboratory and field studies. The collection of actual specimens of plant and animal species is essential and is the prime source of taxonomic studies. These are also fundamental to studies and essential for training in systematics. It is used for classification of an organism, and the information gathered is also stored along with the specimens. In some cases the specimen is preserved for future studies. Biologists have established certain procedures and techniques to store and preserve the information as well as the specimens. Some of these are explained to help you understand the usage of these aids.

 The wide range in the structure of higher plants will never fail to fascinate us. Even though the angiosperms show such a large diversity in external structure or morphology, they are all characterised by presence of roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruits. In chapters 2 and 3, we talked about classification of plants based on morphological and other characteristics. For any successful attempt at classification and at understanding any higher plant (or for that matter any living organism) we need to know standard technical terms and standard definitions. We also need to know about the possible variations in different parts, found as adaptations of the plants to their environment, e.g., adaptions to various habitats, for protection, climbing, storage, etc. If you pull out any weed you will see that all of them have roots, stems and leaves. They may be bearing flowers and fruits. The underground part of the flowering plant is the root system while the portion above the ground forms the shoot system (Figure 5.1).

Differentiate between reticulate and parallel venation.,S. No  Reticulate Venation  Parallel Venation  (i)  Veinlets are conspicuous.  Veinlets are inconspicious.  (ii)  Veinlets form a net-work.  A network is absent.  (iii)  Veins are irregularly distributed.  Veins run parallel to one another. ,"Absent
 Absent
 The arrangement of veins and the veinlets in the lamina of leaf is termed as venation. When the veinlets form a network, the venation is termed as reticulate (Figure 5.7 b). When the veins run parallel to each other within a lamina, the venation is termed as parallel (Figure 5.7 c). Leaves of dicotyledonous plants generally possess reticulate venation, while parallel venation is the characteristic of most monocotyledons.
 "
Where are leaf bladders found and what are their functions ?,"In some aquatic insectivorous plants like Utricularia, some of the leaf segments of much dissected leaves are modified to form small bladders. Function : These bladders have sensitive hair, bristles, trap valve and glands for trapping and digesting small insects.","The stem may not always be typically like what they are expected to be. They are modified to perform different functions (Figure 5.6). Underground stems of potato, ginger, turmeric, zaminkand, Colocasia are modified to store food in them. They also act as organs of perennation to tide over conditions unfavourable for growth. Stem tendrils which develop from axillary buds, are slender and spirally coiled and help plants to climb such as in gourds (cucumber, pumpkins, watermelon) and grapevines. Axillary buds of stems may also get modified into woody, straight and pointed thorns. Thorns are found in many plants such as Citrus, Bougainvillea. They protect plants from browsing animals. Some plants of arid regions modify their stems into flattened (Opuntia), or fleshy cylindrical (Euphorbia) structures. They contain chlorophyll and carry
 Leaves are often modified to perform functions other than photosynthesis. They are converted into tendrils for climbing as in peas or into spines for defence as in cacti (Figure 5.10 a, b). The fleshy leaves of onion and garlic store food (Figure 5.10c). In some plants such as Australian acacia, the leaves are small and short-lived. The petioles in these plants expand, become green and synthesise food. Leaves of certain insectivorous plants such as pitcher plant, venus-fly trap are also modified leaves.

List the various functions of root.,"Important functions of root are: (i) Fixation : The root fixes the plant to the soil i.e, ground. (ii) Absorption : Root absorb nutrients and water from the soil. (iii) Conduction : It conducts absorbed materials from the soil to the aerial parts of the plant.  (iv) Special Functions : In addition to the above functions, some adventitious roots perform different function i.e., in Cuscuta (a parasitic plant) they absorb food from the host's body, in banyan, the prop roots provide support to the plant, in maize, Rhizophora, they support the plant; in Tinospora the green roots perform the function of photosynthesis; in some plants they get swollen and perform as storage organs for the plant; other perform the function of vegetative reproduction Some roots perform the functions of storage of food reproduction, climbing, giving the support to plant.","Roots in some plants change their shape and structure and become modified to perform functions other than absorption and conduction of water and minerals. They are modified for support, storage of food and respiration (Figure 5.4 and 5.5). Tap roots of carrot, turnip and adventitious roots of sweet potato, get swollen and store food. Can you give some more such examples? Have you ever wondered what those hanging structures that support a banyan tree are? These are called prop roots. Similarly, the stems of maize and sugarcane have supporting roots coming out of the lower nodes of the stem. These are called stilt roots. In some plants such as Rhizophora growing in swampy areas, many roots come out of the ground and grow vertically upwards. Such roots, called pneumatophores, help to get oxygen for respiration (Figure 5.5b).
 "
What are the primary functions of a leaf ?,The primary functions of a leaf are : (i) Synthesis of organic food through photosynthesis. (ii) Leaves possess minute pores called stomata. The stomata help in the exchange of gases necessary for photosynthesis and respiration. (iii) Leaves are the main seat of loss of water called force for the ascent of sap and keeps the temperature low in summer.,"5.3 THE LEAF The leaf is a lateral, generally flattened structure borne on the stem. It develops at the node and bears a bud in its axil. The axillary bud later develops into a branch. Leaves originate from shoot apical meristems and are arranged in an acropetal order. They are the most important vegetative organs for photosynthesis. A typical leaf consists of three main parts: leaf base, petiole and lamina (Figure 5.7 a). The leaf is attached to the stem by the leaf base and may

How do you distinguish a simple leaf from a compound leaf ?,"Differences between simple and compound leaf: S. NO.  Simple Leaf  Compound Leaf  (i)  Lamina is not divided into distinct lobes or leaflets i.e., it has single lamina.  (ii)  Axillary bud is present in the axil of simple leaf. Simple leaves are in acropetal succession on stem. Base of leaf may have stipules. Simple leaves appear in one or more plane.  Lamina is incised into two or more distinct leaflets. The leaflets are borne either at the tip of petioles or on the sides of rachis. Leaflets do not bear any axillary bud. Axillary bud is present in the axil of whole leaf. Leaflets of a compound leaf are not in acropetal succession on rachis. Stipules may be present at the base of compound leaf. Leaflets in a compound leaf lie in one plane only.  (iii)  (iv) (v) ","Types of Leaves
 A leaf is said to be simple, when its lamina is entire or when incised, the incisions do not touch the midrib. When the incisions of the lamina reach up to the midrib breaking it into a number of leaflets, the leaf is called compound. A bud is present in the axil of petiole in both simple and compound leaves, but not in the axil of leaflets of the compound leaf. The compound leaves may be of two types (Figure 5.8). In a pinnately compound leaf a number of leaflets are present on a common axis, the rachis, which represents the midrib of the leaf as in neem.

The region of the stem where leaves are born are called nodes while internodes are the portions between two nodes. The stem bears buds, which may be terminal or axillary. Stem is generally green when young and later often become woody and dark brown. The main function of the stem is spreading out branches bearing leaves, flowers and fruits. It conducts water, minerals and photosynthates. Some stems perform the function of storage of food, support, protection and of vegetative propagation.

Write a note on gaseous exchange in cockroach.,Gaseous exchange in cockroach: (i) Cockroach is an insect which possess tracheal system. (ii) It has a complicated system of air tubes which divides continuously and form tracheoles for the exchange of gases. ,"7.4 COCKROACH Cockroaches are brown or black bodied animals that are included in class Insecta of Phylum Arthropoda. Bright yellow, red and green coloured cockroaches have also been reported in tropical regions. Their size ranges from ¼ inches to 3 inches (0.6-7.6 cm) and have long antenna, legs and flat extension of the upper body wall that conceals head. They are nocturnal omnivores that live in damp places throughout the world. They have become residents of human homes and thus are serious pests and vectors of several diseases.
 7.4.1 Morphology The adults of the common species of cockroach, Periplaneta americana are about 34-53 mm long with wings that extend beyond the tip of the abdomen in males. The body of the cockroach is segmented and divisible into three distinct regions – head, thorax and abdomen (Figure 7.14). The entire body is covered by a hard chitinous exoskeleton (brown in colour). In each segment, exoskeleton has hardened plates called sclerites (tergites dorsally and sternites ventrally) that are joined to each other by a thin and flexible articular membrane (arthrodial membrane).
 opening of the spiracles is regulated by the sphincters. Exchange of gases take place at the tracheoles by diffusion. Excretion is performed by Malpighian tubules. Each tubule is lined by glandular and ciliated cells. They absorb nitrogenous waste products and convert them into uric acid which is excreted out through the hindgut. Therefore, this insect is called uricotelic. In addition, the fat body, nephrocytes and urecose glands also help in excretion. The nervous system of cockroach consists of a series of fused, segmentally arranged ganglia joined by paired longitudinal connectives on the ventral side. Three ganglia lie in the thorax, and six in the abdomen. The nervous system of cockroach is spread throughout the body. The head holds a bit of a nervous system while the rest is situated along the ventral (belly-side) part of its body. So, now you understand that if the head of a cockroach is cut off, it will still live for as long as one week. In the head region, the brain is represented by supra-oesophageal ganglion which supplies nerves to antennae and compound eyes. In cockroach, the sense organs are antennae, eyes, maxillary palps, labial palps, anal cerci, etc. The compound eyes are situated at the dorsal surface of the head. Each eye consists of about 2000 hexagonal ommatidia (sing.: ommatidium). With the help of several ommatidia, a cockroach can receive several images of an object. This kind of vision is known as mosaic vision with more sensitivity but less resolution, being common during night (hence called nocturnal vision). Cockroaches are dioecious and both sexes have well developed reproductive organs (Figure 7.18). Male reproductive system consists of a pair of testes one lying on each lateral side in the 4th -6th abdominal segments. From each testis arises a thin vas deferens, which opens into ejaculatory duct through seminal vesicle. The ejaculatory duct opens into male gonopore situated ventral to anus. A characteristic mushroomshaped gland is present in the 6th-7th abdominal segments which functions as an accessory reproductive gland. The external genitalia are represented by male gonapophysis or phallomere (chitinous asymmetrical structures, surrounding the male gonopore). The sperms are stored in the seminal vesicles and are glued together in the form of bundles called spermatophores which are discharged during copulation. The female reproductive sysytem consists of two large ovaries, lying laterally in the 2nd – 6th abdominal segments. Each ovary is formed of a group of eight ovarian tubules or ovarioles, containing a chain of developing ova. Oviducts of each ovary unite into a single median oviduct (also called vagina) which opens into the genital chamber. A pair of spermatheca is present in the 6th segment which opens into the genital chamber. Sperms are transferred through spermatophores. Their fertilised eggs are encased in capsules called oothecae. Ootheca is a dark reddish to blackish brown capsule, about 3/8"" (8 mm) long. They are dropped or

Describe in brief types of nephridia found in earthworm based on their location?,"Nephridia are of three types : (i) Septal Nephridia : These are present on both the sides of intersegmental septa and open into intestine (ii) Integumental Nephridia : These are found attached to the lining of the body wall and open on the body surface. (iii) Pharyngeal Nephridia : These are found on the 4th, 5th, and 6th segment in the form of three paired tufts.  ","The excretory organs occur as segmentally arranged coiled tubules called nephridia (sing.: nephridium). They are of three types: (i) septal nephridia, present on both the sides of intersegmental septa of segment 15 to the last that open into intestine, (ii) integumentary nephridia, attached to lining of the body wall of segment 3 to the last that open on the body surface and (iii) pharyngeal nephridia, present as three paired tufts in the 4th, 5th and 6th segments (Figure 7.12). These different types of nephridia are basically similar in structure. Nephridia regulate the volume and composition of the body fluids. A nephridium starts out as a funnel that collects excess fluid from coelomic chamber. The funnel connects with a tubular part of the nephridium which delivers the wastes through a pore to the surface in the body wall into the digestive tube. Nervous system is basically represented by ganglia arranged segmentwise on the ventral paired nerve cord. The nerve cord in the anterior region (3rd and 4th segments) bifurcates, laterally Figure 7.12 Nephridial system in earthworm encircling the pharynx and joins the cerebral ganglia dorsally to form a nerve ring. The cerebral ganglia alongwith other nerves in the ring integrate sensory input as well as command muscular responses of the body.

They are oval/rounded or irregular in shape. WBCs have nuclei but are devoid of haemoglobin. They are of two kinds: (1) granulocytes, and (2) agranulocytes. Granulocytes possess granules of varying sizes and have lobed nuclei. They are of three kinds: (1) basophils, (2) acidophils, (3) neutrophils based on the staining feature. Monocytes and lymphocytes are two types of agranulocytes. They are non-granular and always have only one nuclei in individual cell.","White blood cells (amoeboid)
 Red blood cells (round and biconcave)
 18.1.2 Formed Elements Erythrocytes, leucocytes and platelets are collectively called formed elements (Figure 18.1) and they constitute nearly 45 per cent of the blood. Erythrocytes or red blood cells (RBC) are the most abundant of all the cells in blood. A healthy adult man has, on an average, 5 millions to 5.5 millions of RBCs mm–3 of blood. RBCs are formed in the red bone marrow in the adults. RBCs are devoid of nucleus in most of the mammals and are biconcave in shape. They have a red coloured, iron containing complex protein called haemoglobin, hence the colour and name of these cells. A healthy individual has 12-16 gms of haemoglobin in every 100 ml of blood. These molecules play a significant role in transport of respiratory gases. RBCs have an average life span of 120 days after which they are destroyed in the spleen (graveyard of RBCs). Leucocytes are also known as white blood cells (WBC) as they are colourless due to the lack of haemoglobin. They are nucleated and are relatively lesser in number which averages 6000-8000 mm–3 of blood. Leucocytes are generally short lived. We have two main categories of WBCs – granulocytes and agranulocytes. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils are different types of granulocytes, while lymphocytes and monocytes are the agranulocytes. Neutrophils are the most abundant cells (60-65 per cent) of the total WBCs and basophils are the least (0.5-1 per cent) among them. Neutrophils and monocytes (6-8 per cent) are phagocytic cells which destroy foreign organisms entering the body. Basophils secrete histamine, serotonin, heparin, etc., and are involved in inflammatory reactions. Eosinophils (2-3 per cent) resist infections and are also

Singly Branched and anastomosing Thin, long and straight Elastic Most abundant in ligaments ","include cartilage, bone, adipose, and blood. In all connective tissues except blood, the cells secrete fibres of structural proteins called collagen or elastin. The fibres provide strength, elasticity and flexibility to the tissue. These cells also secrete modified polysaccharides, which accumulate between cells and fibres and act as matrix (ground substance). Connective tissues are classified into three types: (i) Loose connective tissue, (ii) Dense connective tissue and (iii) Specialised connective tissue. Loose connective tissue has cells and fibres loosely arranged in a semi-fluid ground substance, for example, areolar tissue present beneath the skin (Figure 7.4). Often it serves as a support framework for epithelium. It contains fibroblasts (cells that produce and secrete fibres), macrophages and mast cells. Adipose tissue is another type of loose connective tissue located mainly beneath the skin. The cells of this tissue are specialised to store fats. The excess of nutrients which are not used immediately are converted into fats and are stored in this tissue. Fibres and fibroblasts are compactly packed in the dense connective tissues. Orientation of fibres show a regular or irregular pattern and are called dense regular and dense irregular tissues. In the dense regular connective tissues, the collagen fibres are present in rows between many parallel bundles of fibres. Tendons, which attach skeletal muscles to bones and ligaments which attach one bone to another are examples of this tissue. Dense irregular connective tissue has fibroblasts and many fibres (mostly collagen) that are oriented differently (Figure 7.5). This tissue is present in the skin. Cartilage,

No. (i)  Cartilage The matrix is soft, transparent or semitransparent.  Bone The matrix is hard due to the deposition of inorganic salts such as calcium, phosphate, calcium carbonate, magnesium phosphate etc.  (ii)  In the matrix; there are delicate network of collagen or elastic fibres, in which chondrocytes and lacunae are scattered irregularly.  In the matrix, there are osteocytes, lacunae, canaliculi which remain arranged in definite rows known as lamellae. ","bones and blood are various types of specialised connective tissues. The intercellular material of cartilage is solid and pliable and resists compression. Cells of this tissue (chondrocytes) are enclosed in small cavities within the matrix secreted by them (Figure 7.6a). Most of the cartilages in vertebrate embryos are replaced by bones in adults. Cartilage is present in the tip of nose, outer ear joints, between adjacent bones of the vertebral column, limbs and hands in adults. Bones have a hard and non-pliable ground substance rich in calcium salts and collagen fibres which give bone its strength (Figure 7.6b). It is the main tissue that provides structural frame to the body. Bones support and protect softer tissues and organs. The bone cells (osteocytes) are present in the spaces called lacunae. Limb bones, such as the long bones of the legs, serve weight-bearing functions. They also interact with skeletal muscles attached to them to bring about movements. The bone marrow in some bones is the site of production of blood cells. Blood is a fluid connective tissue containing plasma, red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC) and platelets (Figure 7.6c). It is the main circulating fluid that helps in the transport of various substances. You will learn more about blood in Chapters 17 and 18.

Draw a well labeled diagram of alimentary canal of a cockroach.,, 
Give an account of alimentary canal of frog.,Alimentary Canal of Frog : It is a short tube starting from mouth to cloaca. Mouth opens into buccopharyngeal cavity. It has many maxillary teeth at the margin of upper jaw. Vomerine teeth lie at the floor of this cavity. The tongue is bilobed and muscular. It is used to capture the prey. Gullet opens into the oesophagus which is distended into stomach. Stomach follows small and large intestine. The rectum opens into the cloaca. Liver and pancreas are digestive glands. ,"7.5.2 Anatomy The body cavity of frogs accommodate different organ systems such as digestive, circulatory, respiratory, nervous, excretory and reproductive systems with well developed structures and functions (Figure 7.20). The digestive system consists of alimentary canal and digestive glands. The alimentary canal is short because frogs are carnivores and hence the length of intestine is reduced. The mouth opens into the buccal cavity that
 Cloaca Cloacal Aperture Figure 7.20 Diagrammatic representation of internal organs of frog showing complete digestive system
 leads to the oesophagus through pharynx. Oesophagus is a short tube that opens into the stomach which in turn continues as the intestine, rectum and finally opens outside by the cloaca. Liver secretes bile that is stored in the gall bladder. Pancreas, a digestive gland produces pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes. Food is captured by the bilobed tongue. Digestion of food takes place by the action of HCl and gastric juices secreted from the walls of the stomach. Partially digested food called chyme is passed from stomach to the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum. The duodenum receives bile from gall bladder and pancreatic juices from the pancreas through a common bile duct. Bile emulsifies fat and pancreatic juices digest carbohydrates and proteins. Final digestion takes place in the intestine. Digested food is absorbed by the numerous finger-like folds in the inner wall of intestine called villi and microvilli. The undigested solid waste moves into the rectum and passes out through cloaca. Frogs respire on land and in the water by two different methods. In water, skin acts as aquatic respiratory organ (cutaneous respiration). Dissolved oxygen in the water is exchanged through the skin by diffusion.

Draw labelled of alimentary canal of cockroach and write the role of hepatic caeca and malpighian tubules. ,Refer to SAQ-II/Q 2 Role of hepatic caeca: Secretes digestive juices. Role of malpighian tubules: It is the main excretory organ.,"SUMMARY The digestive system of humans consists of an alimentary canal and associated digestive glands. The alimentary canal consists of the mouth, buccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and the anus. The accessory digestive glands include the salivary glands, the liver (with gall bladder) and the pancreas. Inside the mouth the teeth masticates the food, the tongue tastes the food and manipulates it for proper mastication by mixing with the saliva. Saliva contains a starch digestive enzyme, salivary amylase that digests the starch and converts it into maltose (disaccharide). The food then passes into the pharynx and enters the oesophagus in the form of bolus, which is further carried down through the oesophagus by peristalsis into the stomach. In stomach mainly protein digestion takes place. Absorption of simple sugars, alcohol and medicines also takes place in the stomach. The chyme (food) enters into the duodenum portion of the small intestine and is acted on by the pancreatic juice, bile and finally by the enzymes in the succus entericus, so that the digestion of carbohydrates, proteins and fats is completed. The food then enters into the jejunum and ileum portions of the small intestine. Carbohydrates are digested and converted into monosaccharides like glucose. Proteins are finally broken down into amino acids. The fats are converted to fatty acids and glycerol.

Explain sexual dimorphism exhibited in frog.,Frog exhibits sexual dimorphism. This means that the male and female frog can be distinguished by their external features. The male frog possesses vocal sacs which are most developed during the breeding season and also a copulatory pad on the first digit of the fore limbs which are absent in female frogs.,"Have you ever touched the skin of frog? The skin is smooth and slippery due to the presence of mucus. The skin is always maintained in a moist condition. The colour of dorsal side of body is generally olive green with dark irregular spots. On the ventral side the skin is uniformly pale yellow. The frog never drinks water but absorb it through the skin. Body of a frog is divisible into head and trunk (Figure 7.19). A neck and tail are absent. Above the mouth, a pair of nostrils is present. Eyes are bulged and covered by a nictitating membrane that protects them while in water. On either side of eyes a membranous Head tympanum (ear) receives sound signals. The forelimbs and hind limbs help in swimming, Eye walking, leaping and burrowing. The hind limbs end in five digits and they are larger and muscular than fore limbs that end in four digits. Feet have webbed digits that help in swimming. Frogs exhibit sexual dimorphism. Male frogs can be distinguished by the Fore limb presence of sound producing vocal sacs and also a copulatory pad on the first digit of the fore limbs Hind limb which are absent in female frogs.

Bright yellow, red and green coloured cockroaches have also been reported in tropical regions. Their size ranges from ¼ inches to 3 inches (0.6-7.6 cm) and have long antenna, legs and flat extension of the upper body wall that conceals head. They are nocturnal omnivores that live in damp places throughout the world. They have become residents of human homes and thus are serious pests and vectors of several diseases.

The body of the cockroach is segmented and divisible into three distinct regions – head, thorax and abdomen (Figure 7.14). The entire body is covered by a hard chitinous exoskeleton (brown in colour). In each segment, exoskeleton has hardened plates called sclerites (tergites dorsally and sternites ventrally) that are joined to each other by a thin and flexible articular membrane (arthrodial membrane).

 glued to a suitable surface, usually in a crack or crevice of high relative humidity near a food source. On an average, females produce 9-10 oothecae, each containing 14-16 eggs. The development of P. americana is paurometabolous, meaning there is development through nymphal stage. The nymphs look very much like adults. The nymph grows by moulting about 13 times to reach the adult form. The next to last nymphal stage has wing pads but only adult cockroaches have wings. Many species of cockroaches are wild and are of no known economic importance yet. A few species thrive in and around human habitat. They are pests because they spoil food and contaminate it with their smelly excreta. They can transmit a variety of bacterial diseases by contaminating food material.

When a fungus reproduces sexually, two haploid hyphae of compatible mating types come together and fuse. In some fungi the fusion of two haploid cells immediately results in diploid cells (2n). However, in other fungi (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes), an intervening dikaryotic stage (n + n, i.e., two nuclei per cell) occurs; such a condition is called a dikaryon and the phase is called dikaryophase of fungus. Later, the parental nuclei fuse and the cells become diploid. The fungi form fruiting bodies in which reduction division occurs, leading to formation of haploid spores. The morphology of the mycelium, mode of spore formation and fruiting bodies form the basis for the division of the kingdom into various classes.

Reproduction cannot be all-inclusive defining characteristic of living organisms. Comment.,"Some organisms like mules, sterile worker bees, infertile human couples, etc., exhibit Characteristics of living things but they do not reproduce. Therefore reproduction cannot be an all-inclusive defining characteristic of living organisms.","When you look around, you see both living and non-living things. You must have wondered and asked yourself – ‘what is it that makes an organism living, or what is it that an inanimate thing does not have which a living thing has’ ? The answer to this is the presence of the basic unit of life – the cell in all living organisms. All organisms are composed of cells. Some are composed of a single cell and are called unicellular organisms while others, like us, composed of many cells, are called multicellular organisms.

What processes are basic to taxonomy?,"Characterisation, identification and nomenclature are the processes which are basic to taxonomy.","process and ecological information of organisms are essential and form the basis of modern taxonomic studies. Hence, characterisation, identification, classification and nomenclature are the processes that are basic to taxonomy. Taxonomy is not something new. Human beings have always been interested in knowing more and more about the various kinds of organisms, particularly with reference to their own use. In early days, human beings needed to find sources for their basic needs of food, clothing and shelter. Hence, the earliest classifications were based on the ‘uses’ of various organisms. Human beings were, since long, not only interested in knowing more about different kinds of organisms and their diversities, but also the relationships among them. This branch of study was referred to as systematics. The word systematics is derived from the Latin word ‘systema’ which means systematic arrangement of organisms. Linnaeus used Systema Naturae as the title of his publication. The scope of systematics was later enlarged to include identification, nomenclature and classification. Systematics takes into account evolutionary relationships between organisms.
 "
Why was nomenclature necessary?,"Plants and animals in the world are known by their local names. These local names would vary from place to place. Therefore, there was a need to standardise the naming of living organisms which is recognised all over the world. Therefore the process called nomenclature was necessary.","If you look around you will see a large variety of living organisms, be it potted plants, insects, birds, your pets or other animals and plants. There are also several organisms that you cannot see with your naked eye but they are all around you. If you were to increase the area that you make observations in, the range and variety of organisms that you see would increase. Obviously, if you were to visit a dense forest, you would probably see a much greater number and kinds of living organisms in it. Each different kind of plant, animal or organism that you see, represents a species. The number of species that are known and described range between 1.7-1.8 million. This refers to biodiversity or the number and types of organisms present on earth. We should remember here that as we explore new areas, and even old ones, new organisms are continuously being identified. As stated earlier, there are millions of plants and animals in the world; we know the plants and animals in our own area by their local names. These local names would vary from place to place, even within a country. Probably you would recognise the confusion that would be created if we did not find ways and means to talk to each other, to refer to organisms we are talking about. Hence, there is a need to standardise the naming of living organisms such that a particular organism is known by the same name all over the world. This process is called nomenclature. Obviously, nomenclature or naming is only possible when the organism is described correctly and we know to what organism the name is attached to. This is identification. In order to facilitate the study, number of scientists have established procedures to assign a scientific name to each known organism. This is acceptable to biologists all over the world. For plants, scientific names are based on agreed principles and criteria, which are provided in International Code for Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). You may ask, how are animals named? Animal taxonomists have evolved International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). The scientific names ensure that each organism has only one name. Description of any organism should enable the people (in any part of the world) to arrive at the same name. They also ensure that such a name has not been used for any other known organism. Biologists follow universally accepted principles to provide scientific names to known organisms. Each name has two components – the Generic name and the specific epithet. This system of providing a name with two components is called Binomial nomenclature. This naming system given by Carolus Linnaeus is being practised by biologists all over the world. This naming system using a two word format was found convenient. Let us take the example of mango to understand the way of

Since the category is a part of overall taxonomic arrangement, it is called the taxonomic category and all categories together constitute the taxonomic hierarchy.

Differentiate between the following : (i) Growth in plants and growth in animals (ii) Growth in unicellular organisms and growth in multicellular organisms (iii) Catabolism and anabolism.,"(i) Growth in plants  Growth in animals  Plants grow faster and continuously throughout their life span.  Animals grow slowly and after reaching certain size and age, animals stop growing.  (ii) Growth in unicellular organisms Growth can be observed in only 𝑖𝑛 − 𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑜 cultures.

(iii) Anabolism The biochemical reactions which are concerned with the synthesis of complex substances from simple substances are collectively called anabolism. E.g., photosynthesis.  Catabolism The biochemical reactions which are concerned with breakdown of complex organic substances into simple substances are collectively called catabolism. E.g., respiration. ","grows by cell division. In plants, this growth by cell division occurs continuously throughout their life span. In animals, this growth is seen only up to a certain age. However, cell division occurs in certain tissues to replace lost cells. Unicellular organisms grow by cell division. One can easily observe this in in vitro cultures by simply counting the number of cells under the microscope. In majority of higher animals and plants, growth and reproduction are mutually exclusive events. One must remember that increase in body mass is considered as growth. Non-living objects also grow if we take increase in body mass as a criterion for growth. Mountains, boulders and sand mounds do grow. However, this kind of growth exhibited by non-living objects is by accumulation of material on the surface. In living organisms, growth is from inside. Growth, therefore, cannot be taken as a defining property of living organisms. Conditions under which it can be observed in all living organisms have to be explained and then we understand that it is a characteristic of living systems. A dead organism does not grow. Reproduction, likewise, is a characteristic of living organisms. In multicellular organisms, reproduction refers to the production of progeny possessing features more or less similar to those of parents. Invariably and implicitly we refer to sexual reproduction. Organisms reproduce by asexual means also. Fungi multiply and spread easily due to the millions of asexual spores they produce. In lower organisms like yeast and hydra, we observe budding. In Planaria (flat worms), we observe true regeneration, i.e., a fragmented organism regenerates the lost part of its body and becomes, a new organism. The fungi, the filamentous algae, the protonema of mosses, all easily multiply by fragmentation. When it comes to unicellular organisms like bacteria, unicellular algae or Amoeba, reproduction is synonymous with growth, i.e., increase in number of cells. We have already defined growth as equivalent to increase in cell number or mass. Hence, we notice that in single-celled organisms, we are not very clear about the usage of these two terms – growth and reproduction. Further, there are many organisms which do not reproduce (mules, sterile worker bees, infertile human couples, etc). Hence, reproduction also cannot be an all-inclusive defining characteristic of living organisms. Of course, no non-living object is capable of reproducing or replicating by itself. Another characteristic of life is metabolism. All living organisms are made of chemicals. These chemicals, small and big, belonging to various classes, sizes, functions, etc., are constantly being made and changed into some other biomolecules. These conversions are chemical reactions or metabolic reactions. There are thousands of metabolic reactions occurring simultaneously inside all living organisms, be they

Distinguish between taxonomy and systematics.,"S. No.  Taxonomy  1.  It is the study of organisms on the basis of their characteristics.  2.  It includes morphological and anatomical features for identification.  Systematics It is the study of diversity of organisms and all their comparative and evolutionary relationships. It deals with comparative anatomy, ecology, physiology and bio-chemistry. ","process and ecological information of organisms are essential and form the basis of modern taxonomic studies. Hence, characterisation, identification, classification and nomenclature are the processes that are basic to taxonomy. Taxonomy is not something new. Human beings have always been interested in knowing more and more about the various kinds of organisms, particularly with reference to their own use. In early days, human beings needed to find sources for their basic needs of food, clothing and shelter. Hence, the earliest classifications were based on the ‘uses’ of various organisms. Human beings were, since long, not only interested in knowing more about different kinds of organisms and their diversities, but also the relationships among them. This branch of study was referred to as systematics. The word systematics is derived from the Latin word ‘systema’ which means systematic arrangement of organisms. Linnaeus used Systema Naturae as the title of his publication. The scope of systematics was later enlarged to include identification, nomenclature and classification. Systematics takes into account evolutionary relationships between organisms.

Taxonomy for a long time was considered as descriptive science. Why?,"(i) Taxonomy: It is the branch of biology dealing with identification, naming and classification of the organism on the basis of some laws and principles. (ii) It includes characterization, identification, nomenclature and classification. (iii) The morphological characters were considered in the beginning to classify organisms. (iv) The species was considered static and fixed entity.","SUMMARY The living world is rich in variety. Millions of plants and animals have been identified and described but a large number still remains unknown. The very range of organisms in terms of size, colour, habitat, physiological and morphological features make us seek the defining characteristics of living organisms. In order to facilitate the study of kinds and diversity of organisms, biologists have evolved certain rules and principles for identification, nomenclature and classification of organisms. The branch of knowledge dealing with these aspects is referred to as taxonomy. The taxonomic studies of various species of plants and animals are useful in agriculture, forestry, industry and in general for knowing our bio-resources and their diversity. The basics of taxonomy like identification, naming and classification of organisms are universally evolved under international codes. Based on the resemblances and distinct differences, each organism is identified and assigned a correct scientific/biological name comprising two words as per the binomial system of nomenclature. An organism represents/occupies a place or position in the system of classification. There are many categories/ranks and are generally referred to as taxonomic categories or taxa. All the categories constitute a taxonomic hierarchy. Taxonomists have developed a variety of taxonomic aids to facilitate identification, naming and classification of organisms. These studies are carried out from the actual specimens which are collected from the field and preserved as referrals in the form of herbaria, museums and in botanical gardens and zoological parks. It requires special techniques for collection and preservation of specimens in herbaria and museums. Live specimens, on the other hand, of plants and animals, are found in botanical gardens or in zoological parks. Taxonomists also prepare and disseminate information through manuals and monographs for further taxonomic studies. Taxonomic keys are tools that help in identification based on characteristics.

What are intermediate categories?,"With the discovery of more organisms it is difficult to adjust them to traditional categories. So, the existing categories have been split by prefixing ‘super’ and ‘sub’ to the existing categories like sub-kingdom, sub-phylum, super class etc. These are referred as intermediate categories. This has also facilitated more sound and scientific placement of various taxa.","decreasing. Lower the taxa, more are the characteristics that the members within the taxon share. Higher the category, greater is the difficulty of determining the relationship to other taxa at the same level. Hence, the problem of classification becomes more complex. Table 1.1 indicates the taxonomic categories to which some common organisms like housefly, man, mango and wheat belong.

Differentiate between homospores and hetero Sporous pteridophytes with one example of each. (DDE practice paper),"Difference between heterosporous and homospores pteridophytes : heterosporous Pteridophytes  Homospores Pteridophytes  These pteridophyes produces two types of spores microspores and megaspores,  These produce only one kinf of spores.  Microspore germinate into male gametophyte and megaspore germinate into female gamete, E.g. Selaginella and salvinia  Each apore gerninates into a prothallust that bears both antheridia and archegonia. E.g. Dryopteris ","The gymnosperms are heterosporous; they produce haploid microspores and megaspores. The two kinds of spores are produced within sporangia that are borne on sporophylls which are arranged spirally along an axis to form lax or compact strobili or cones. The strobili bearing microsporophylls and microsporangia are called microsporangiate or male strobili. The microspores develop into a male gametophytic generation which is highly reduced and is confined to only a limited number of cells. This reduced gametophyte is called a pollen grain. The development of pollen grains take place within the microsporangia. The cones bearing megasporophylls with ovules or megasporangia are called macrosporangiate or female strobili. The male or female cones or strobili may be borne on the same tree (Pinus). However, in cycas male cones and megasporophylls are borne on different trees. The megaspore mother cell is differentiated from one of the cells of the nucellus. The nucellus is protected by envelopes and the composite structure is called an ovule. The ovules are borne on megasporophylls which may be clustered to form the female cones. The megaspore mother cell divides meiotically to form four megaspores. One of the megaspores enclosed within the megasporangium develops into a multicellular female gametophyte that bears two or more archegonia or female sex organs. The multicellular female gametophyte is also retained within megasporangium. Unlike bryophytes and pteridophytes, in gymnosperms the male and the female gametophytes do not have an independent free-living existence. They remain within the sporangia retained on the sporophytes. The pollen grain is released from the microsporangium. They are carried in air currents and come in contact with the opening of the ovules borne on megasporophylls. The pollen tube carrying the male gametes grows towards archegonia in the ovules and discharge their contents near the mouth of the archegonia. Following fertilisation, zygote develops into an embryo and the ovules into seeds. These seeds are not covered.

Sexual reproduction may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Union of gametes take place in the water with the oogonium.","them. Food is stored as complex carbohydrates, which may be in the form of laminarin or mannitol. The vegetative cells have a cellulosic wall usually covered on the outside by a gelatinous coating of algin. The protoplast contains, in addition to plastids, a centrally located vacuole and nucleus. The plant body is usually attached to the substratum by a holdfast, and has a stalk, the stipe and leaf like photosynthetic organ – the frond. Vegetative reproduction takes place by fragmentation. Asexual reproduction in most brown algae is by biflagellate zoospores that are pear-shaped and have two unequal laterally attached flagella. Sexual reproduction may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Union of gametes may take place in water or within the oogonium (oogamous species). The gametes are pyriform (pear-shaped) and bear two laterally attached flagella. The common forms are Ectocarpus, Dictyota, Laminaria, Sargassum and Fucus (Figure 3.1b).
 A dominant, independent, photosynthetic, thalloid or erect phase is represented by a haploid gametophyte and it alternates with the shortlived multicelluler sporophyte totally or partially dependent on the gametophyte for its anchorage and nutrition. All bryophytes represent this pattern. The diploid sporophyte is represented by a dominant, independent, photosynthetic, vascular plant body. It alternates with multicellular, saprophytic/autotrophic, independent but short-lived haploid gametophyte. Such a pattern is known as haplo-diplontic life cycle. All pteridophytes exhibit this pattern (Figure 3.7 c). Interestingly, while most algal genera are haplontic, some of them such as Ectocarpus, Polysiphonia, kelps are haplo-diplontic. Fucus, an alga is diplontic.
 SUMMARY Plant kingdom includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms. Algae are chlorophyll-bearing simple, thalloid, autotrophic and largely aquatic organisms. Depending on the type of pigment possesed and the type of stored food, algae are classfied into three classes, namely Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae. Algae usually reproduce vegetatively by fragmentation, asexually by formation of different types of spores and sexually by formation of gametes which may show isogamy, anisogamy or oogamy. Bryophytes are plants which can live in soil but are dependent on water for sexual reproduction. Their plant body is more differentiated than that of algae. It is thallus-like and prostrate or erect and attached to the substratum by rhizoids. They possess root-like, leaf-like and stem-like structures. The bryophytes are divided into liverworts and mosses. The plant body of liverworts is thalloid and dorsiventral whereas mosses have upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. The main plant body of a bryophyte is gamete-producing and is called a gametophyte. It bears the male sex organs called antheridia and female sex organs called archegonia. The male and female gametes produced fuse to form zygote which produces a multicellular body called a sporophyte. It produces haploid spores. The spores germinate to form gametophytes. In pteridophytes the main plant is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root, stem and leaves. These organs possess well-differentiated vascular tissues. The sporophytes bear sporangia which produce spores. The spores germinate to form gametophytes which require cool, damp places to grow. The gametophytes bear male and female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia, respectively. Water is required for transfer of male gametes to archegonium where zygote is formed after fertilisation. The zygote produces a sporophyte.

(iii) Wood from tropical tree ferns is mostly used as a building material It resists termite decay. (iv) Ferns are used as astringents during child birth to stop bleeding. (v) Maiden hair fern is a source of an expectorant.,"3.3 PTERIDOPHYTES The Pteridophytes include horsetails and ferns. Pteridophytes are used for medicinal purposes and as soil-binders. They are also frequently grown as ornamentals. Evolutionarily, they are the first terrestrial plants to possess vascular tissues – xylem and phloem. You shall study more about these tissues in Chapter 6. The pteridophytes are found in cool, damp, shady places though some may flourish well in sandy-soil conditions. You may recall that in bryophytes the dominant phase in the life cycle is the gametophytic plant body. However, in pteridophytes, the main plant body is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root, stem and leaves (Figure 3.3). These organs possess well-differentiated vascular tissues. The leaves in pteridophyta are small (microphylls) as in Selaginella or large (macrophylls) as in ferns. The sporophytes bear sporangia that are subtended by leaf-like appendages called sporophylls. In some cases sporophylls may form distinct compact structures called strobili or cones (Selaginella, Equisetum). The sporangia produce spores by meiosis in spore mother cells. The spores germinate to give rise to inconspicuous, small but multicellular,

(viii) The zygote formed by the fusion of the two gametes develops into sporophyte. (ix) It grows and consists of three parts: foot, seta and capsule.","3.2.2 Mosses The predominant stage of the life cycle of a moss is the gametophyte which consists of two stages. The first stage is the protonema stage, which develops directly from a spore. It is a creeping, green, branched and frequently filamentous stage. The second stage is the leafy stage, which develops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud. They consist of upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. They are attached to the soil through multicellular and branched rhizoids. This stage bears the sex organs. Vegetative reproduction in mosses is by fragmentation and budding in the secondary protonema. In sexual reproduction, the sex organs antheridia and archegonia are produced at the apex of the leafy shoots. After fertilisation, the zygote develops into a sporophyte, consisting of a foot, seta and capsule. The sporophyte in mosses is more elaborate than that in liverworts. The capsule contains spores. Spores are formed after meiosis. The mosses have an elaborate mechanism of spore dispersal. Common examples of mosses are Funaria, Polytrichum and Sphagnum (Figure 3.2).
 3.3 PTERIDOPHYTES The Pteridophytes include horsetails and ferns. Pteridophytes are used for medicinal purposes and as soil-binders. They are also frequently grown as ornamentals. Evolutionarily, they are the first terrestrial plants to possess vascular tissues – xylem and phloem. You shall study more about these tissues in Chapter 6. The pteridophytes are found in cool, damp, shady places though some may flourish well in sandy-soil conditions. You may recall that in bryophytes the dominant phase in the life cycle is the gametophytic plant body. However, in pteridophytes, the main plant body is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root, stem and leaves (Figure 3.3). These organs possess well-differentiated vascular tissues. The leaves in pteridophyta are small (microphylls) as in Selaginella or large (macrophylls) as in ferns. The sporophytes bear sporangia that are subtended by leaf-like appendages called sporophylls. In some cases sporophylls may form distinct compact structures called strobili or cones (Selaginella, Equisetum). The sporangia produce spores by meiosis in spore mother cells. The spores germinate to give rise to inconspicuous, small but multicellular,

Mention the points of differences between a zygospore and a zoospore.,"S.No  Zygospore  (i)  Zygospore i thick walled resting spore.  (ii)  Zygospore is the product of sexual reproduction by fusion of contents of two similar gametangia. it found in a in group of phycomycetes, zygomycetes fungi and all orders of green algae. It is diploid.  (iii)  (iv)  Zoospore Zsospore is naked spore produced within a sporangium. Zsospore is motile having one, two or more flagella.  It is found in same pgycomycetes funfi and green brown algae. It is Haploid. ","(iii) Meiosis in zygote resulting in haploid spores. When a fungus reproduces sexually, two haploid hyphae of compatible mating types come together and fuse. In some fungi the fusion of two haploid cells immediately results in diploid cells (2n). However, in other fungi (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes), an intervening dikaryotic stage (n + n, i.e., two nuclei per cell) occurs; such a condition is called a dikaryon and the phase is called dikaryophase of fungus. Later, the parental nuclei fuse and the cells become diploid. The fungi form fruiting bodies in which reduction division occurs, leading to formation of haploid spores. The morphology of the mycelium, mode of spore formation and fruiting bodies form the basis for the division of the kingdom into various classes.
 (a)
 2.3.1 Phycomycetes Members of phycomycetes are found in aquatic habitats and on decaying wood in moist and damp places or as obligate parasites on plants. The mycelium is aseptate and coenocytic. Asexual reproduction takes place by zoospores (motile) or by aplanospores (non-motile). These spores are endogenously produced in sporangium. A zygospore is formed by fusion of two gametes. These gametes are similar in morphology (isogamous) or dissimilar (anisogamous or oogamous). Some common examples are Mucor (Figure 2.5a), Rhizopus (the bread mould mentioned earlier) and Albugo (the parasitic fungi on mustard).

 is branched and septate. The asexual spores are conidia produced exogenously on the special mycelium called conidiophores. Conidia on germination produce mycelium. Sexual spores are called ascospores which are produced endogenously in sac like asci (singular ascus). These asci are arranged in different types of fruiting bodies called ascocarps. Some examples are Aspergillus (Figure 2.5b), Claviceps and Neurospora. Neurospora is used extensively in biochemical and genetic work. Many members like morels and truffles are edible and are considered delicacies.
 2.3.3 Basidiomycetes Commonly known forms of basidiomycetes are mushrooms, bracket fungi or puffballs. They grow in soil, on logs and tree stumps and in living plant bodies as parasites, e.g., rusts and smuts. The mycelium is branched and septate. The asexual spores are generally not found, but vegetative reproduction by fragmentation is common. The sex organs are absent, but plasmogamy is brought about by fusion of two vegetative or somatic cells of different strains or genotypes. The resultant structure is dikaryotic which ultimately gives rise to basidium. Karyogamy and meiosis take place in the basidium producing four basidiospores. The basidiospores are exogenously produced on the basidium (pl.: basidia). The basidia are arranged in fruiting bodies called basidiocarps. Some common members are Agaricus (mushroom) (Figure 2.5c), Ustilago (smut) and Puccinia (rust fungus).

Describe the gametophytic phase exhibited by moss.,"The predominant stage in the life cycle of moss is the gametophyte which consists of two stages: (a) The first stage is the protonema stage which develops directly from a spore; it is a creeping, green branched and flamentous stage. (b) b) The second stage is the leaty stage which develops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud.

 A dominant, independent, photosynthetic, thalloid or erect phase is represented by a haploid gametophyte and it alternates with the shortlived multicelluler sporophyte totally or partially dependent on the gametophyte for its anchorage and nutrition. All bryophytes represent this pattern. The diploid sporophyte is represented by a dominant, independent, photosynthetic, vascular plant body. It alternates with multicellular, saprophytic/autotrophic, independent but short-lived haploid gametophyte. Such a pattern is known as haplo-diplontic life cycle. All pteridophytes exhibit this pattern (Figure 3.7 c). Interestingly, while most algal genera are haplontic, some of them such as Ectocarpus, Polysiphonia, kelps are haplo-diplontic. Fucus, an alga is diplontic.
 SUMMARY Plant kingdom includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms. Algae are chlorophyll-bearing simple, thalloid, autotrophic and largely aquatic organisms. Depending on the type of pigment possesed and the type of stored food, algae are classfied into three classes, namely Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae. Algae usually reproduce vegetatively by fragmentation, asexually by formation of different types of spores and sexually by formation of gametes which may show isogamy, anisogamy or oogamy. Bryophytes are plants which can live in soil but are dependent on water for sexual reproduction. Their plant body is more differentiated than that of algae. It is thallus-like and prostrate or erect and attached to the substratum by rhizoids. They possess root-like, leaf-like and stem-like structures. The bryophytes are divided into liverworts and mosses. The plant body of liverworts is thalloid and dorsiventral whereas mosses have upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. The main plant body of a bryophyte is gamete-producing and is called a gametophyte. It bears the male sex organs called antheridia and female sex organs called archegonia. The male and female gametes produced fuse to form zygote which produces a multicellular body called a sporophyte. It produces haploid spores. The spores germinate to form gametophytes. In pteridophytes the main plant is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root, stem and leaves. These organs possess well-differentiated vascular tissues. The sporophytes bear sporangia which produce spores. The spores germinate to form gametophytes which require cool, damp places to grow. The gametophytes bear male and female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia, respectively. Water is required for transfer of male gametes to archegonium where zygote is formed after fertilisation. The zygote produces a sporophyte.
 "
What are the structure of leaves found in ferns ?,"(i) The laves are large and are called fronds in ferns. (ii) Some ferns have simpie leaves with one blade. (iii) But most ferns have pinnately compound leaves 𝑖. 𝑒., blades are divided into leaflets or pinnae like feather. (iv) The pinnately compound leaves may be unipinnate (leaflets not divided), bipinnate (leaflets subdivided one), tripinnate (leflets divided twice.) (v) Ferns are regarded as ornamental plants because of their graceful compounds leaves.","Types of Leaves
 A leaf is said to be simple, when its lamina is entire or when incised, the incisions do not touch the midrib. When the incisions of the lamina reach up to the midrib breaking it into a number of leaflets, the leaf is called compound. A bud is present in the axil of petiole in both simple and compound leaves, but not in the axil of leaflets of the compound leaf. The compound leaves may be of two types (Figure 5.8). In a pinnately compound leaf a number of leaflets are present on a common axis, the rachis, which represents the midrib of the leaf as in neem.

Explain in brief the structure of prothullas of fern.,Prothallus of Ferns : (1) it is a heart shaped structure. The sex organs are present on the lower surface of the prothallus below the apical notch. (ii) Sex organs are antheridia and archegonia. Prothalhus is produced from the meiopore as gametophyte of fern. (iii) Below the sex organs are rhizoids. (iv) Archegonia are flask shaped but antheridia are globose. (v) Male and female gametes are produced in antheridia and archegonia. ,"free-living, mostly photosynthetic thalloid gametophytes called prothallus. These gametophytes require cool, damp, shady places to grow. Because of this specific restricted requirement and the need for water for fertilisation, the spread of living pteridophytes is limited and restricted to narrow geographical regions. The gametophytes bear male and female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia, respectively. Water is required for transfer of antherozoids – the male gametes released from the antheridia, to the mouth of archegonium. Fusion of male gamete with the egg present in the archegonium result in the formation of zygote. Zygote thereafter produces a multicellular well-differentiated sporophyte which is the dominant phase of the pteridophytes. In majority of the pteridophytes all the spores are of similar kinds; such plants are called homosporous. Genera like Selaginella and Salvinia which produce two kinds of spores, macro (large) and micro (small) spores, are known as heterosporous. The megaspores and microspores germinate and give rise to female and male gametophytes, respectively. The female gametophytes in these plants are retained on the parent sporophytes for variable periods. The development of the zygotes into young embryos take place within the female gametophytes. This event is a precursor to the seed habit considered an important step in evolution. The pteridophytes are further classified into four classes: Psilopsida (Psilotum); Lycopsida (Selaginella, Lycopodium), Sphenopsida (Equisetum) and Pteropsida (Dryopteris, Pteris, Adiantum).

(ii) These are arranged like pearls on the lower surface (iii) The spore-bearing leaves are called sporophylls. (iv) The sori bear groups of sporangia, which are full of spores. (v) The plant body exhibits sporophyte and is diploid (2n). (vi) The spores formed after meiosis are haploid (n). (vii) They are dispersed through a special mechanism present in the sporangium.","3.3 PTERIDOPHYTES The Pteridophytes include horsetails and ferns.

 C HAPTER 15 PLANT G ROWTH AND D EVELOPMENT You have already studied the organisation of a flowering plant in Chapter 5. Have you ever thought about where and how the structures like roots, 15.2 Differentiation, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds arise and that too in an orderly Dedifferentiation sequence? You are, by now, aware of the terms seed, seedling, plantlet, and mature plant. You have also seen that trees continue to increase in height Redifferentiation or girth over a period of time. However, the leaves, flowers and fruits of the same tree not only have limited dimensions but also appear and fall 15.3 Development periodically and some time repeatedly. Why does vegetative phase precede 15.4 Plant Growth flowering in a plant? All plant organs are made up of a variety of tissues; is Regulators there any relationship between the structure of a cell, a tissue, an organ 15.5 Photoperiodism and the function they perform? Can the structure and the function of these be altered? All cells of a plant are descendents of the zygote. The question 15.6 Vernalisation is, then, why and how do they have different structural and functional attributes? Development is the sum of two processes: growth and differentiation. To begin with, it is essential and sufficient to know that the development of a mature plant from a zygote (fertilised egg) follow a precise and highly ordered succession of events. During this process a complex body organisation is formed that produces roots, leaves, branches, flowers, fruits, and seeds, and eventually they die (Figure 15.1). The first step in the process of plant growth is seed germination. The seed germinates when favourable conditions for growth exist in the environment. In absence of such favourable conditions the seeds do not germinate and goes into a period of suspended growth or rest. Once favourable conditions return, the seeds resume metabolic activities and growth takes place. In this chapter, you shall also study some of the factors which govern and control these developmental processes. These factors are both intrinsic (internal) and extrinsic (external) to the plant. 15.1 Growth
 The wide range in the structure of higher plants will never fail to fascinate us. Even though the angiosperms show such a large diversity in external structure or morphology, they are all characterised by presence of roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruits. In chapters 2 and 3, we talked about classification of plants based on morphological and other characteristics. For any successful attempt at classification and at understanding any higher plant (or for that matter any living organism) we need to know standard technical terms and standard definitions. We also need to know about the possible variations in different parts, found as adaptations of the plants to their environment, e.g., adaptions to various habitats, for protection, climbing, storage, etc. If you pull out any weed you will see that all of them have roots, stems and leaves. They may be bearing flowers and fruits. The underground part of the flowering plant is the root system while the portion above the ground forms the shoot system (Figure 5.1).
 "
Describe the types of roots found in Cycas & Pinus.,"The roots of gymnosperms are generally tap root. In Cycas, the roots are of two typesnormal and coralloid. The coralloid roots are irregular negatively geotropic, devoid of root. These are associated with nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria. In Pinus, besides the normal roots there are the mycorrhizal roots which have fungal association in the form of mycorrhiza.","3.4 GYMNOSPERMS The gymnosperms (gymnos : naked, sperma : seeds) are plants in which the ovules are not enclosed by any ovary wall and remain exposed, both before and after fertilisation. The seeds that develop post-fertilisation, are not covered, i.e., are naked. Gymnosperms include medium-sized trees or tall trees and shrubs (Figure 3.4). One of the gymnosperms, the giant redwood tree Sequoia is one of the tallest tree species. The roots are generally tap roots. Roots in some genera have fungal association in the form of mycorrhiza (Pinus), while in some others (Cycas) small specialised roots called coralloid roots are associated with N2- fixing cyanobacteria. The stems are unbranched (Cycas) or branched (Pinus, Cedrus). The leaves may be simple or compound. In Cycas the pinnate leaves persist for a few years. The leaves in gymnosperms are well-adapted to withstand extremes of temperature, humidity and wind. In conifers, the needle-like leaves reduce the surface area. Their thick cuticle and sunken stomata also help to reduce water loss.
 "
What do you understand by double fertilization ?,"(i) Double fertilization means the fusion of one male gamete with egg cell and other male gamete with the polar nuclei, this is known as triple fusion.  (ii) When male gamete fuses with egg cell it forms diploid zygote (2n) and when the other male gamete fuses with the polar nuclei (2n) it forms a triploid endosperm (3n). (iii) Endosperm is a female gametophytic tissue which provides nutrition to the embryo.","10.4 MEIOSIS The production of offspring by sexual reproduction includes the fusion of two gametes, each with a complete haploid set of chromosomes. Gametes are formed from specialised diploid cells. This specialised kind of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half results in the production of haploid daughter cells. This kind of division is called meiosis. Meiosis ensures the production of haploid phase in the life cycle of sexually reproducing organisms whereas fertilisation restores the diploid phase. We come across meiosis during gametogenesis in plants and animals. This leads to the formation of haploid gametes. The key features of meiosis are as follows: l l l

(iii) Plants which live for a year, or part of year are termed as annuals; which live for two years are termed as biennials and which live for more than two years are termed as perennials. (iv) Plants which live in extremely dry conditions are termed as xerophytes: plants living in water are termed as hydrophytes and those living in moderate conditions are termed as mesophyies.

Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids located in the chloroplasts. Pyrenoids contain protein besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made of an inner layer of cellulose and an outer layer of pectose. Vegetative reproduction usually takes place by fragmentation or by formation of different types of spores. Asexual reproduction is by flagellated zoospores produced in zoosporangia.

Write any four main characteristic features of algae.,"The main characteristic features of algae are :  (i) The body od thallus of multicellular algae ranges from microscopic, colonial aggregates of cells, fine filaments to flattened sheets of cells. (ii) Vascular tissues are absent in algae. (iii) Mechanical tiesues are also absent in algae. (iv) Most algae multiply by vegetative and asexual and modes of reproduction.","3.1 ALGAE Algae are chlorophyll-bearing, simple, thalloid, autotrophic and largely aquatic (both fresh water and marine) organisms. They occur in a variety of other habitats: moist stones, soils and wood. Some of them also occur in association with fungi (lichen) and animals (e.g., on sloth bear). The form and size of algae is highly variable, ranging from colonial forms like Volvox and the filamentous forms like Ulothrix and Spirogyra (Figure 3.1). A few of the marine forms such as kelps, form massive plant bodies. The algae reproduce by vegetative, asexual and sexual methods. Vegetative reproduction is by fragmentation. Each fragment develops into a thallus. Asexual reproduction is by the production of different types of spores, the most common being the zoospores. They are flagellated (motile) and on germination gives rise to new plants. Sexual reproduction takes place through fusion of two gametes. These gametes can be flagellated and similar in size (as in Ulothrix) or non-flagellated (non-motile) but similar in size (as in Spirogyra). Such reproduction is called isogamous. Fusion of two gametes dissimilar in size, as in species of Eudorina is termed as anisogamous. Fusion between one large, nonmotile (static) female gamete and a smaller, motile male gamete is termed oogamous, e.g., Volvox, Fucus.

Q. 6 How does the red algae prepare their food ?,Red algae are marine and mostly occur in oceans. The photosynthetic pigments are phycoerythrin and phycocyanin along with chlorophyll and carotenoid. Red algse are photoautotrophic in their mode of nutrition. They synthesize food in presence of chlorophyll in their chromatophores or chloroplasts.,"Algae are useful to man in a variety of ways. At least a half of the total carbon dioxide fixation on earth is carried out by algae through photosynthesis. Being photosynthetic they increase the level of dissolved oxygen in their immediate environment. They are of paramount importance as primary producers of energy-rich compounds which form the basis of the food cycles of all aquatic animals. Many species of Porphyra, Laminaria and Sargassum are among the 70 species of marine algae used as food. Certain marine brown and red algae produce large amounts of hydrocolloids (water holding substances), e.g., algin (brown algae) and carrageen (red algae) which are used commercially. Agar, one of the commercial products obtained from Gelidium and Gracilaria are used to grow microbes and in preparations of ice-creams and jellies. Chlorella a unicellular alga rich in proteins is used as food supplement even by space travellers. The algae are divided into three main classes: Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae.
 3.1.1 Chlorophyceae The members of chlorophyceae are commonly called green algae. The plant body may be unicellular, colonial or filamentous. They are usually grass green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and b. The pigments are localised in definite chloroplasts. The chloroplasts may be discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon-shaped in different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids located in the chloroplasts. Pyrenoids contain protein besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made of an inner layer of cellulose and an outer layer of pectose. Vegetative reproduction usually takes place by fragmentation or by formation of different types of spores. Asexual reproduction is by flagellated zoospores produced in zoosporangia. The sexual reproduction shows considerable variation in the type and formation of sex cells and it may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Some commonly found green algae are: Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Ulothrix, Spirogyra and Chara (Figure 3.1a).
 3.1.3 Rhodophyceae The members of rhodophyceae are commonly called red algae because of the predominance of the red pigment, r-phycoerythrin in their body. Majority of the red algae are marine with greater concentrations found in the warmer areas. They occur in both well-lighted regions close to the surface of water and also at great depths in oceans where relatively little light penetrates. The red thalli of most of the red algae are multicellular. Some of them have complex body organisation. The food is stored as floridean starch which is very similar to amylopectin and glycogen in structure. The red algae usually reproduce vegetatively by fragmentation. They reproduce asexually by non-motile spores and sexually by non-motile

What are the modes of reproduction in algae ?,"(i) Most algae multiply by vegetative and asexual modes of reproduction. (ii) Asexual spores are of two types, mitospores or meiospores which are mostly motile or non – motile. (iii) Sexual reprodaction involves fusion of gametes. (iv) It may be isogamoias (fusion of similar gametes), anisogamous (fusion of dissimilar gametes) or oogamous (fusion of gamets different in size, shape and behaviour) type.","3.1 ALGAE Algae are chlorophyll-bearing, simple, thalloid, autotrophic and largely aquatic (both fresh water and marine) organisms. They occur in a variety of other habitats: moist stones, soils and wood. Some of them also occur in association with fungi (lichen) and animals (e.g., on sloth bear). The form and size of algae is highly variable, ranging from colonial forms like Volvox and the filamentous forms like Ulothrix and Spirogyra (Figure 3.1). A few of the marine forms such as kelps, form massive plant bodies. The algae reproduce by vegetative, asexual and sexual methods. Vegetative reproduction is by fragmentation. Each fragment develops into a thallus. Asexual reproduction is by the production of different types of spores, the most common being the zoospores. They are flagellated (motile) and on germination gives rise to new plants. Sexual reproduction takes place through fusion of two gametes. These gametes can be flagellated and similar in size (as in Ulothrix) or non-flagellated (non-motile) but similar in size (as in Spirogyra). Such reproduction is called isogamous. Fusion of two gametes dissimilar in size, as in species of Eudorina is termed as anisogamous. Fusion between one large, nonmotile (static) female gamete and a smaller, motile male gamete is termed oogamous, e.g., Volvox, Fucus.

What are phycocolloids ? List their functions.,"Brown algae have a colBoidal covering over their cellulosic cell wall, consisting of a mixture of polysaccharides collectively called phycocolloids. 𝑒. 𝑔 ., alginic acid (algin), fucoildin and fucin. These prevents drying or freezing (in water), when algae are exposed to air during low tides and protect cells when waves beat them against the rocks.","3.1.1 Chlorophyceae The members of chlorophyceae are commonly called green algae.

 3.1.2 Phaeophyceae The members of phaeophyceae or brown algae are found primarily in marine habitats. They show great variation in size and form. They range from simple branched, filamentous forms (Ectocarpus) to profusely branched forms as represented by kelps, which may reach a height of 100 metres. They possess chlorophyll a, c, carotenoids and xanthophylls. They vary in colour from olive green to various shades of brown depending upon the amount of the xanthophyll pigment, fucoxanthin present in
 Brown algae

Why do mosses thrive only in moist habitat ?,"Monses (bryophytes) are non-vascular land plant of moist habitat that grow densely together and often form green carpets or mats on damp soils. It is because in the absence of roots, thallus absorbs water and minerals directly from gound or atmosphere, Hence, they can thrive only on moist places,","3.3 PTERIDOPHYTES The Pteridophytes include horsetails and ferns. Pteridophytes are used for medicinal purposes and as soil-binders. They are also frequently grown as ornamentals. Evolutionarily, they are the first terrestrial plants to possess vascular tissues – xylem and phloem. You shall study more about these tissues in Chapter 6. The pteridophytes are found in cool, damp, shady places though some may flourish well in sandy-soil conditions. You may recall that in bryophytes the dominant phase in the life cycle is the gametophytic plant body. However, in pteridophytes, the main plant body is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root, stem and leaves (Figure 3.3). These organs possess well-differentiated vascular tissues. The leaves in pteridophyta are small (microphylls) as in Selaginella or large (macrophylls) as in ferns. The sporophytes bear sporangia that are subtended by leaf-like appendages called sporophylls. In some cases sporophylls may form distinct compact structures called strobili or cones (Selaginella, Equisetum). The sporangia produce spores by meiosis in spore mother cells. The spores germinate to give rise to inconspicuous, small but multicellular,

Describe the importance of mosses.,"The importance of mosses are : (i) Mosses form dense mat over soil preventing soil erosion. (ii) These play an important role in plant succession on rocky areas. (iii) Sphagnum, a moss provide peat which is a valuable fuel like coal. It is also used as packing material for trans shipment of living material because of their capacity to hold water.","3.2.2 Mosses The predominant stage of the life cycle of a moss is the gametophyte which consists of two stages. The first stage is the protonema stage, which develops directly from a spore. It is a creeping, green, branched and frequently filamentous stage. The second stage is the leafy stage, which develops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud. They consist of upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. They are attached to the soil through multicellular and branched rhizoids. This stage bears the sex organs. Vegetative reproduction in mosses is by fragmentation and budding in the secondary protonema. In sexual reproduction, the sex organs antheridia and archegonia are produced at the apex of the leafy shoots. After fertilisation, the zygote develops into a sporophyte, consisting of a foot, seta and capsule. The sporophyte in mosses is more elaborate than that in liverworts. The capsule contains spores. Spores are formed after meiosis. The mosses have an elaborate mechanism of spore dispersal. Common examples of mosses are Funaria, Polytrichum and Sphagnum (Figure 3.2).
 "
What are thallophyta ? How many groups are included in it ? ,"Thallophyta posesses the simplest plants which possess undifferentiated or thallus like forms. Vascular tissues are absent. Differentiation of true roots, stems and leaves is also absent.","The wide range in the structure of higher plants will never fail to fascinate us. Even though the angiosperms show such a large diversity in external structure or morphology, they are all characterised by presence of roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruits. In chapters 2 and 3, we talked about classification of plants based on morphological and other characteristics. For any successful attempt at classification and at understanding any higher plant (or for that matter any living organism) we need to know standard technical terms and standard definitions. We also need to know about the possible variations in different parts, found as adaptations of the plants to their environment, e.g., adaptions to various habitats, for protection, climbing, storage, etc. If you pull out any weed you will see that all of them have roots, stems and leaves. They may be bearing flowers and fruits. The underground part of the flowering plant is the root system while the portion above the ground forms the shoot system (Figure 5.1).

How does an algae differ from fungi ?,"S. No. (i) (ii)  Algae Chlorophyll present therefore they are green. Autotropic nutrition.  (iii) (iv)  Absorb inorganic and mineral salts Chlamydomonas and Ulothrix.  Fungi Chlorophylil absent, they are non-green. Heterotrophic nutrition saprophytic and parasitic. Absorb organic and mineral salts. Aibugo and Yeant. ","3.1.1 Chlorophyceae The members of chlorophyceae are commonly called green algae. The plant body may be unicellular, colonial or filamentous. They are usually grass green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and b. The pigments are localised in definite chloroplasts.

What are horsetails ?,"(i) Honetails are represented by a single genus Equisetum. (ii) It is a fern in which the plant body has a underground rhizome that bears acrial green stems. It makes this plant to bear a fanciful resemblance to a horsetail. (iii) Leaves are small, scale like and form whorls at nodes. (iv) Leaves bear strobili at the tips of stems that produce spores. On germination spores produce gametophyte.","Figure 3.3 Pteridophytes : (a) Selaginella (b) Equisetum (c) Fern (d) Salvinia

 "
Differentiate between Cryptogams and Phanerogams ?,"S. No  Cryptogams  (i)  These are seedless plants.  (ii)  It has three divisions thallophytes, bryophytes and pteridophytes. An ovule is not formed. Pollination is absent. The plants require external water for fertilization.  (iii) (iv) (v)  Phanerogams Phanerogams are seeded plants. There is only one division of spermatophyta. An ovule is present. Pollination is present. External water is not required for fertilization.  ","Bryophytes are also called amphibians of the plant kingdom because these plants can live in soil but are dependent on water for sexual reproduction. They usually occur in damp, humid and shaded localities. They play an important role in plant succession on bare rocks/soil. The plant body of bryophytes is more differentiated than that of algae. It is thallus-like and prostrate or erect, and attached to the substratum by unicellular or multicellular rhizoids. They lack true roots, stem or leaves. They may possess root-like, leaf-like or stem-like structures. The main plant body of the bryophyte is haploid. It produces gametes, hence is called a gametophyte. The sex organs in bryophytes are multicellular. The male sex organ is called antheridium. They produce biflagellate antherozoids. The female sex organ called archegonium is flask-shaped and produces a single egg. The antherozoids are released into water where they come in contact with archegonium. An antherozoid fuses with the egg to produce the zygote. Zygotes do not undergo reduction division immediately. They produce a multicellular body called a sporophyte. The sporophyte is not free-living but attached to the photosynthetic gametophyte and derives nourishment from it. Some cells of the sporophyte undergo reduction division (meiosis) to produce haploid spores. These spores germinate to produce gametophyte. Bryophytes in general are of little economic importance but some mosses provide food for herbaceous mammals, birds and other animals. Species of Sphagnum, a moss, provide peat that have long been used as fuel, and as packing material for trans-shipment of living material because of their capacity to hold water. Mosses along with lichens are the first organisms to colonise rocks and hence, are of great ecological importance. They decompose rocks making the substrate suitable for the growth of higher plants. Since mosses form dense mats on the soil, they reduce the impact of falling rain and prevent soil erosion. The bryophytes are divided into liverworts and mosses.
 The gymnosperms are the plants in which ovules are not enclosed by any ovary wall. After fertilisation the seeds remain exposed and therefore these plants are called naked-seeded plants. The gymnosperms produce microspores and megaspores which are produced in microsporangia and megasporangia borne on the sporophylls. The sporophylls – microsporophylls and megasporophylls – are arranged spirally on axis to form male and female cones, respectively. The pollen grain germinates and pollen tube releases the male gamete into the ovule, where it fuses with the egg cell in archegonia. Following fertilisation, the zygote develops into embryo and the ovules into seeds. In angiosperms, the male sex organs (stamen) and female sex organs (pistil) are borne in a flower. Each stamen consists of a filament and an anther. The anther produces pollen grains (male gametophyte) after meiosis. The pistil consists of an ovary enclosing one to many ovules. Within the ovule is the female gametophyte or embryo sac which contains the egg cell. The pollen tube enters the embryo-sac where two male gametes are discharged. One male gamete fuses with egg cell (syngamy) and other fuses with diploid secondary nucleus (triple fusion). This phenomenon of two fusions is called double fertilisation and is unique to angiosperms. The angiosperms are divided into two classes – the dicotyledons and the monocotyledons. During the life cycle of any sexually reproducing plant, there is alternation of generations between gamete producing haploid gametophyte and spore producing diploid sporophyte. However, different plant groups as well as individuals may show different patterns of life cycles – haplontic, diplontic or intermediate.
