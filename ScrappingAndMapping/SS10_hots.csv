Classify resources on the basis of exhaustibility. Mention four features of each.  ,"On the basis of exhaustibility, there are two types of resources :  Renewable resources  Non-renewable resources  Renewable resources :  They can be renewed or obtained even after they are used.  They are not exhaustible due to constant use.  They are affected by external environment.  For example : solar and wind energy.  Non-renewable resources :  They can’t be reproduced once they are used.  They are exhaustible due to continuous use.  They are free from environmental effects.  For example : minerals and fossil fuels.","TYPES OF RESOURCES On the Basis of Origin Biotic Resources: These are obtained from biosphere and have life such as human beings, flora and fauna, fisheries, livestock etc. Abiotic Resources: All those things which are composed of non-living things are called abiotic resources. For example, rocks and metals. On the Basis of Exhaustibility Renewable Resources: The resources which can be renewed or reproduced by physical, chemical or mechanical processes are known as renewable or replenishable resources. For example, solar and wind energy, water, forests and wildlife, etc. The renewable resource may further be divided into continuous or flow (Fig.1.2). Non-Renewable Resources: These occur over a very long geological time. Minerals and fossil fuels are examples of such resources. These resources take millions of years in their formation. Some of the resources like metals are recyclable and some like fossil fuels cannot be recycled and get exhausted with their use. On the Basis of Ownership Individual Resources: These are also owned privately by individuals. Many farmers own land which is allotted to them by government against the payment of revenue. In villages there are people with land ownership but there are many who are landless. Urban people own plots, houses and other property. Plantation, pasture lands, ponds, water in wells etc. are some of the examples of resources ownership by individuals. Make a list of resources owned by your household. Community Owned Resources: There are resources which are accessible to all the members of the community. Village commons (grazing grounds, burial grounds, village 2

Explain reasource planning. What are the steps involved in resource planning ?  Or 		Why is resource planning essential in India ?  Or 		What is resource planning ? Why is resource planning essential ? Explain it with three reasons.,"Resource planning is a technique or skill for proper utilization of resources.  As resources are limited, their planning is necessary so that we can use them properly and also save them for our future generations.  Resources are not only limited but they are distributed over different parts of the country.  Resource planning is also essential for production of resources and to protect them from over exploitation.","RESOURCE PLANNING Planning is the widely accepted strategy for judicious use of resources. It has importance in a country like India, which has enormous diversity in the availability of resources. There are regions which are rich in certain types of resources but are deficient in some other resources. There are some regions which can be considered self sufficient in terms of the availability of resources and there are some regions which have acute shortage of some vital resources. For example, the states of J harkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits. Arunachal Pradesh has abundance of water resources but lacks in infrastructural development. The state of Rajasthan is very well endowed with solar and wind energy but lacks in water resources. The cold desert of Ladakh is relatively isolated from the rest of the country. It has very rich cultural heritage but it is deficient in water, infrastructure and some vital minerals. This calls for balanced resource planning at the national, state, regional and local levels.
 Prepare a list of resources found in your state and also identify the resources that are important but deficit in your state. Resource Planning in India Resource planning is a complex process which involves : (i) identification and inventory of resources across the regions of the country. This involves surveying, mapping and qualitative and quantitative estimation and measurement of the resources. (ii) Evolving a planning structure endowed with appropriate technology, skill and institutional set up for implementing resource development plans. (iii) Matching the resource development plans with overall national development plans. India has made concerted efforts for achieving the goals of resource planning right from the First Five Year Plan launched after Independence. 4

Provide a suitable classification for resources on the basis of ownership. Mention main features of any three types of such resources.  3-,"Classification for resources on the basis of ownership :  Individual resources  Community owned resources  National resources  International resources 		 Individual Resources : Resources which are privately owned against the payment of revenue by individuals. e.g., ponds, pasture lands etc. 		 Community Owned Resources : Resources which are accessible to all the members of a community, e.g., picnic spots. 		 National Resources : All the resources which are present in the political boundaries of a nation up to 12 nautical miles in the ocean from the coast, termed as terrestrial water and resources theirin belong to the nation.  International Resources : There are international institutions which regulate some resource. The oceanic resources beyond 200 nautical miles of the Exclusive Economic Zone belong to open ocean ocean and no individual country can utilise theses without the concurrence of international institutions. 3","ponds, etc.) public parks, picnic spots, playgrounds in urban areas are de facto accessible to all the people living there. National Resources: Technically, all the resources belong to the nation. The country has legal powers to acquire even private property for public good. You might have seen roads, canals, railways being constructed on fields owned by some individuals. Urban Development Authorities get empowered by the government to acquire land. All the minerals, water resources, forests, wildlife, land within the political boundaries and oceanic area up to 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) from the coast termed as territorial water and resources therein belong to the nation. International Resources: There are international institutions which regulate some resources. The oceanic resources beyond 200 nautical miles of the Exclusive Economic Zone belong to open ocean and no individual country can utilise these without the concurrence of international institutions. Do you know that India has got the right to mine manganese nodules from the bed of the Indian Ocean from that area which lies beyond the exclusive economic zone. Identify some other resources which are international in nature. On the Basis of the Status of Development Potential Resources: Resources which are found in a region, but have not been utilised. For example, the western parts of India particularly Rajasthan and Gujarat have enormous potential for the development of wind and solar energy, but so far these have not been developed properly. Developed Resources: Resources which are surveyed and their quality and quantity have been determined for utilisation. The development of resources depends on technology and level of their feasibility. Stock: Materials in the environment which have the potential to satisfy human needs but human beings do not have the appropriate technology to access these, are

"‘Indiscriminate use of resources had led to numerous problems.’ Justify this statement. 		 [Board Term 1, KVS-2014,  2012,","Ans.		 Resources are vital for human survival and it was believed that resources are free gift of nature. The indiscriminate use of resources led to the following problems :  To satisfy the greed of few individuals, depletion of resources were continued.  Due to the accumulation of resources in few hands, the society gets divided into two segments, i.e., rich and poor.  Indiscriminate use of resources led to ecological crises, e.g., ozone layer depletion, land degradation, global warming and environmental pollution. ","D EVELOPMENT OF RESOURCES Resources are vital for human survival as well as for maintaining the quality of life. It was believed that resources are free gifts of nature. A s a result, human beings used them indiscriminately and this has led to the following major problems. • Depletion of resources for satisfying the greed of a few individuals. • Accumulation of resources in few hands, which, in turn, divided the society into two segments i.e. haves and have nots or rich and poor.

Why do we need to conserve our forests and wildlife ? Explain any two steps taken by the government to protect forests and wildlife resources. ," We need to conserve our forests and wildlife because :  Conservation preserves the ecological diversity and our life support system : air, water and soil.  Conservation also preserves the genetic diversity of plants and animals for better growth of species and breeding.  It makes the planet Earth safe.  Steps taken by the government to protect forests and wild life resources :  The Indian Wildlife Protection Act was implemented in 1972 with various provisions for protecting habitats.  Central and many state governments have established national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.","Conservation in the background of rapid decline in wildlife population and forestry has become essential. But why do we need to conserve our forests and wildlife? Conservation preserves the ecological diversity and our life support systems – water, air and soil. It also preserves the genetic diversity of plants and animals for better growth of species and breeding. For example, in agriculture, we are still dependent on traditional crop varieties. Fisheries too are heavily dependent on the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity. In the 1960s and 1970s, conservationists demanded a national wildlife protection programme. The Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act was implemented in 1972, with various provisions for protecting habitats. A n allIndia list of protected species was also published. The thrust of the programme was towards protecting the remaining population of certain endangered species by banning hunting, giving legal protection to their habitats, and restricting trade in wildlife. Subsequently, central and many state governments established national parks and wildlife sanctuaries about which you have already studied. The central government also announced several projects for protecting specific animals, which were gravely threatened, including the tiger, the onehorned rhinoceros, the Kashmir stag or hangul, three types of crocodiles – fresh water crocodile, saltwater crocodile and the Gharial, the Asiatic lion, and others. Most recently, the Indian elephant, black buck (chinkara), the great Indian bustard (godawan) and the snow leopard, etc. have been given full or partial legal protection against hunting and trade throughout India.
 Have you noticed any activity which leads to the loss of biodiversity around you? Write a note on it and suggest some measures to prevent it. The destruction of forests and wildlife is not just a biological issue. The biological loss is strongly correlated with the loss of cultural diversity. Such losses have increasingly marginalised and impoverished many indigenous and other forest-dependent communities, who directly depend on various components of the forest and wildlife for food, drink, medicine, culture, spirituality, etc. Within the poor, women are affected more than men. In many societies, women bear the major responsibility of collection of fuel, fodder, water and other basic subsistence needs. As these resources are depleted, the drudgery of women increases and sometimes they have to walk for more than 10 km to collect these resources. This causes serious health problems for women and negligence of home and children because of the increased hours of work, which often has serious social implications. The indirect impact of degradation such as severe drought or deforestation-induced floods, etc. also hits the poor the hardest. Poverty in these cases is a direct outcome of environmental destruction. Therefore, forest and wildlife, are vital to the quality of life and environment in the 18

Describe any five different types of species of flora and fauna as per the classification given by IUCN. ,"They can be classified in the following ways :  Normal Species : Species whose population is normal for their survival. For example : Cattle, sal, pine, rodents, etc.  Endangered Species : These are species which are in danger of extinction. For example : Black buck, crocodile, sangai etc.  Vulnerable Species : These are species whose population has decreased over a period of time and danger of extinction. For example : blue sheep, Asiatic elephant, etc.  Rare Species : Species which are small in number and in danger of extinction if not been taken care of. For example : brown bear, desert fox, hornbill, etc.  Endemic Species : These are species which are only found in some particular areas usually isolated by natural or geographical barriers. For example : Andaman teal, mithun, etc.  Extinct Species : These species have vanished from a local area, region, country, continent or the entire earth. For example : Asiatic Cheetah, pink head duck, etc.  ","If you look around, you will be able to find that there are some animals and plants which are unique in your area. In fact, India is one of the world’s richest countries in terms of its vast array of biological diversity. This is possibly twice or thrice the number yet to be discovered. You have already studied in detail about the extent and variety of forest and wildlife resources in India. You may have realised the importance of these resources in our daily life. These diverse flora and fauna are so well integrated in our daily life that we take these for granted. But, lately, they are under great stress mainy due to insensitivity to our environment. Find out stories prevalent in your region which are about the harmonious relationship between human beings and nature. Some estimates suggest that at least 10 per cent of India’s recorded wild flora and 20 per cent of its mammals are on the threatened list. Many of these would now be categorised as ‘critical’, that is on the verge of extinction like the cheetah, pink-headed duck, mountain quail, forest spotted owlet, and plants like madhuca insignis (a wild variety of mahua) and h u b b a r d i a h e p t a n e u r o n, ( a s p e c i e s o f grass). In fact, no one can say how many species may have already been lost. Today, we only talk of the larger and more visible animals and plants that have become extinct but what about smaller animals like insects and plants?
 Vanishing Forests The dimensions of deforestation in India are staggering. The forest and tree cover in the country is estimated at 79.42 million hectare, which is 24.16 per cent of the total geographical area (dense forest 12.2 per cent; open forest 9.14 per cent; and mangrove 0.14 per cent). According to the State of Forest Report (2015), the dense forest cover has increased by 3,775 sq km since 2013. However, this apparent increase in the forest cover is due to conservation measures, management interventions and plantation, etc., by different agencies.
 Vulnerable Species: These are species whose population has declined to levels from where it is likely to move into the endangered category in the near future if the negative factors continue to operate. The examples of such species are blue sheep, Asiatic elephant, Gangetic dolphin, etc. Rare Species: Species with small population may move into the endangered or vulnerable category if the negative factors affecting them continue to operate. The examples of such species are the Himalayan brown bear, wild Asiatic buffalo, desert fox and hornbill, etc. Endemic Species: These are species which are only found in some particular areas usually isolated by natural or geographical barriers. Examples of such species are the A ndaman teal, Nicobar pigeon, A ndaman wild pig, mithun in A runachal Pradesh.

 L et us now understand the different categories of existing plants and animal species. Based on the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (I U CN ), we can classify as follows – Normal Species: Species whose population levels are considered to be normal for their survival, such as cattle, sal, pine, rodents, etc. Endangered Species: These are species which are in danger of extinction. The survival of such species is difficult if the negative factors that have led to a decline in their population continue to operate. The examples of such species are black buck, crocodile, Indian wild ass, Indian rhino, lion tailed macaque, sangai (brow anter deer in Manipur), etc.

 Extinct Species: These are species which are not found after searches of known or likely areas where they may occur. A species may be extinct from a local area, region, country, continent or the entire earth. Examples of such species are the Asiatic cheetah, pink head duck. Asiatic Cheetah: where did they go? The world’s fastest land mammal, the cheetah (Acinonyx jubantus), is a unique and specialised member of the cat family and can move at the speed of 112 km./hr. The cheetah is often mistaken for a leopard. Its distinguishing marks are the long teardropshaped lines on each side of the nose from the corner of its eyes to its mouth. Prior to the 20th century, cheetahs were widely distributed throughout Africa and Asia. Today, the Asian cheetah is nearly extinct due to a decline of available habitat and prey. The species was declared extinct in India long back in 1952. What are the negative factors that cause such fearful depletion of the flora and fauna?

‘Nature - worship is an old age belief’. Explain how has it helped in the conservation of forests and wild life. ,"It has helped in the conservation of forests and wildlife in the following ways :  Such beliefs have preserved several virgin forests in pristine form called Sacred Groves. These parts of large forests have been left untouched by local people.  Certain societies like the Mundas and the Santhals revere a particular tree which they have preserved since time immemorial. 3-  To many of us, Peepal and Banyan trees are considered sacred.  Sacred qualities are often ascribed to springs, mountain peaks, plants and animals which are closely protected.  One can find troops of macaques and langurs around many temples. They are fed daily and are treated as a part of temple devotees.","Sacred groves - a wealth of diverse and rare species Nature worship is an age old tribal belief based on the premise that all creations of nature have to be protected. Such beliefs have preserved several virgin forests in pristine form called Sacred Groves (the forests of God and Goddesses). These patches of forest or parts of large forests have been left untouched by the local people and any interference with them is banned. Certain societies revere a particular tree which they have preserved from time immemorial. The Mundas and the Santhal of Chota Nagpur region worship mahua (Bassia latifolia) and kadamba (Anthocaphalus cadamba) trees, and the tribals of Odisha and Bihar worship the tamarind (Tamarindus indica) and mango (Mangifera indica) trees during weddings. To many of us, peepal and banyan trees are considered sacred. Indian society comprises several cultures, each with its own set of traditional methods of conserving nature and its creations. Sacred qualities are often ascribed to springs, mountain peaks, plants and animals which are closely protected. You will find troops of macaques and langurs around many temples. They are fed daily and treated as a part of temple devotees. In and around Bishnoi villages in Rajasthan, herds of blackbuck, (chinkara), nilgai and peacocks can be seen as an integral part of the community and nobody harms them.

‘’Forests play a key role in the ecological system.’’ Highlight the values of forest in our life.  Or 		Explain three reasons why we need to save the biodiversity of our planet ? ,"Ans.		 We need to save the biodiversity of our planet because :  Human beings alongwith all living organisms form a complex web of ecological system in which they are only a part and are very much dependent on this system for their existence.  The plants, animals and micro-organisms recreate the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the soil that produces our food without which we cannot survive.  Forests play a key role in the ecological system as these are also the primary producers on which all other living beings depend.  ","We share this planet with millions of other living beings, starting from micro-organisms and bacteria, lichens to banyan trees, elephants and blue whales. This entire habitat that we live in has immense biodiversity. We humans along with all living organisms form a complex web of ecological system in which we are only a part and very much dependent on this system for our own existence. For example, the plants, animals and micro-organisms re-create the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the soil that produces our food without which we cannot survive. Forests play a key role in the ecological system as these are also the primary producers on which all other living beings depend.

Mention any four major threats to the population of tiger ? Explain the efforts made by the government to protect them.  Or 		Write a brief note on ‘Project Tiger’. ,"Tiger is one of the key wildlife species in the faunal web. In 1973, the authorities felt that the tiger population had dwindled to 1,827 from an estimated 55,000 at the turn of the century. Major threats to tigers are poaching for trade, shrinking habitat, depletion of prey based species, growing human population, etc. ‘Project Tiger’ is one of the well-publicised wildlife campaigns in the world that was launched in 1973. In 1993, the population of tiger had dropped to 3,600. There are 39 tiger reserves in India. Corbett National Park in Uttaranchal, Sunderbans National Park in West Bengal, Bandhavgarh National Park in Madhya Pradesh, Sariska Wildlife Sanctuary in Rajasthan, Manas Tiger Reserve in Assam and Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala are some of the tiger reserves of India.  3 ¾¾ Sources ; distribution; utilization ; multipurpose projects ; water scarcity ; need for conservation and management; rainwater harvesting . 3/4th of the earth’s surface is covered with water, but TOPIC - 1 fresh water accounts for a small proportion. Fresh water Water Scarcity and the need for water is mainly obtained from surface run off and ground water conservation; Multipurpose river which is continually renewed and recharged through the projects & Integrated Water Resource hydrological cycle. Management .... P. 82 zz Water scarcity : Due to variations in seasonal and annual precipitation, the availability of water varies over place and TOPIC - 2 time. Water scarcity is mainly caused due to the excessive use Rainwater Harvesting .... P. 84 and unequal access to water for different social groups. zz An area having ample water resources can have to face water scarcity due to the following reasons :  Greater demand for water by large and growing population and unequal access to it.  Water resources are being over-exploited to expand agriculture and consequently ground water levels are falling.  Post independent India has witnessed intense industrialisation and urbanisation, exerting increasing pressure on fresh water resources.  Multiplying urban centers with large and dense populations have further aggravated the problem of water scarcity. zz In housing societies or colonies, most of the houses have their own ground water pumping devices to meet the water needs. Thus, water resources are being overexploited. Multi-purpose River Projects and Integrated Water Resource Management : zz The history reveals use of many sophisticated hydraulic structures from ancient times, such as dams of stone, reservoirs or lakes, embankments and canals for irrigation. zz Some ancient hydraulic structures are listed below :  Sringaverapura near Allahabad had a sophisticated water harvesting system, which channelised the flood water of Ganga river. It dates back to 1st century B.C.  There are many extensively built dams, lakes and irrigation systems. The most important lake is Sudarshan lake.  Bhopal lake is one of the largest artificial lakes built in the 11th century A.D.  In the 14th century, the tank in Hauz Khas, Delhi was constructed by Iltutmish for supplying water to the Siri Fort area. zz Uses of dams :  Irrigation.		  Electricity generation.  Water supply for domestic and industrial uses.		  Flood control.  Recreation.		  Inland navigation.  Fish breeding. zz Thus, dams are now referred to as multipurpose projects. zz J.L. Nehru proudly proclaimed dams as the temples of modern India because of their potential to integrate development of agriculture and the village economy with rapid industrialisation and growth of the urban economy. zz Reasons for opposing multi-purpose projects :  Poor sediment flow.  Excessive sedimentation at the bottom of the reservoir. zz  Poorer habitats for the rivers’ aquatic life.  Difficult for aquatic fauna to migrate.  Submerge the existing vegetation and soil leading to its decomposition over a period of time. zzRain water harvesting : Rain water harvesting system was a viable alternative of multipurpose projects both socioeconomically and environmentally. Roof-top rain water harvesting was commonly practised in Rajasthan to store drinking water. zzIn arid and semi-arid regions of Rajasthan, almost all houses traditionally had underground tanks for storing drinking water. zzRain water is also referred to as palar pani and it is considered as the purest form of natural water. zzRoof-top rain water harvesting is the most common practice in Shillong in Meghalaya. zzTamil Nadu is the first and the only state in India which has made roof-top rain water harvesting structures compulsory. There are legal provisions to punish the defaulters. zzHydrological Cycle : This is the journey that water takes as it circulates from the land to the sky and back again. It is also known as the ‘water cycle’. zzFresh Water : Water not from the sea and is not salty or brackish. zzGround Water : The water which exists below the ground surface is the zone of saturation and can be extracted through well or any other means or emerges as springs and base flows in streams and rivers. zzHydraulic Structure : All dams, lakes, canals, wells and ponds etc. in which rainwater is collected. zzHydroelectricity : It is the power which is generated with the help of running water. zzDam : A dam is a barrier across flowing water that obstructs, directs or retards the flow, often creating a reservoir, lake or impoundment. zzMultipurpose Project : A multi-purpose project or river valley project serves a number of purposes simultaneously such as irrigation, flood control, generating hydroelectricity and tourism, e.g., the Bhakra Nangal Dam. zzRain Water Harvesting : Rainwater harvesting is gathering, accumulating and storing rainwater for different uses. zzAquifer : A layer of rock or soil which can absorb and hold water. zzWater Scarcity : Shortage of water as compared to its demand is known as water scarcity. zzGuls or Kuls : In hilly and mountainous regions, people build diversion channels like the ‘Guls’ or ‘Kuls’ of Western Himalayas for agriculture. zzInundation Canal : It is meant to direct flood waters during the rainy season. zzDrip Irrigation : It is a type of irrigation in which water gets dropped in the form of drips close to roots of the plants in order to conserve the moisture. zzSurface Runoff : This is the water flow that occurs when the soil is infiltrated to full capacity and excess water from rain, melted snow or other sources flows over the land. 1.

 dwindled to 1,827 from an estimated 55,000 at the turn of the century. The major threats to tiger population are numerous, such as poaching for trade, shrinking habitat, depletion of prey base species, growing human population, etc. The trade of tiger skins and the use of their bones in traditional medicines, especially in the Asian countries left the tiger population on the verge of extinction. Since India and Nepal provide habitat to about two-thirds of the surviving tiger population in the world, these two nations became prime targets for poaching and illegal trading. “Project Tiger”, one of the wellpublicised wildlife campaigns in the world, was launched in 1973. Tiger conservation has been viewed not only as an effort to save an endangered species, but with equal importance as a means of preserving biotypes of sizeable magnitude.

About 27 per cent of the area of the country is the plateau region. It possesses rich reserves of minerals, fossil fuels and forests.

A man or a woman who believes in equal rights and opportunities for men and women is called a feminist. Secularism implies religious freedom, right to speak and right to accept any religion. Most of the women’s movements aim at equality in personal and family life of women. These movements are called feminist movements. Indian democracy faces the problem of casteism, communalism, illiteracy, unemployment and poverty. Communities having a relatively small population in a society are called minorities. A system of separate electorate and representation for people belonging to different communities is known as communal representation. The laws that deal with family-related matters, such as marriage, divorce etc. are known as family laws. Buddhism is the major religion of Sri Lanka and Hinduism is the major religion of Nepal. The use of religion in politics is known as communal politics. Sweden, Norway and Finland have high women participation in public life. Gandhiji was against untouchability. Jyotiba Phule, Dr. B.R.

Gender, Religion and Politics Gender and Politics Religion and Politics Caste and Politics Gender division or a form of hierarchical division exists in India. Gandhiji said that politics must be guided by ethics drawn from religion. Sexual division of labour exists in many Indian homes even now. Problem begins when religion is seen as the basis of nation. With economic development, large scale urbanization, growth of literacy and education, occupational mobility and the weakening position of landlords in the villages; the old notions of caste hierarchy are breaking down. Gender discrimination in all spheres of life has given rise to Feminist Movement. Communal politics is based on the idea that religion is the principal basis of social community. To curb the low proportion of women participation in Indian legislature, 1/3rd of seats in Panchayats and Municipalities are now reserved for women. Yet the influence of caste on politics and vice versa has not disappeared in India. GENDER, RELIGION AND CASTE","We have seen two instances of the expression of social divisions in the arena of politics, one largely positive and the other largely negative. Let us turn to our final case, that of caste and politics, that has both positive and the negative aspects.

 divisions, make different promises to different communities, look after due representation of various communities and make policies to redress the grievances of the disadvantaged communities. Social divisions affect voting in most countries. People from one community tend to prefer some party more than others. In many countries there are parties that focus only on one community. Yet all this does not lead to disintegration of the country. Three determinants Three factors are crucial in deciding the outcome of politics of social divisions. First of all, the outcome depends on how people perceive their identities. If people see their identities in singular and exclusive terms, it becomes very difficult to accommodate. As long as people in Northern Ireland saw themselves as only Catholic or Protestant, their differences were difficult to reconcile. It is much easier if the people see that their identities are multiple and are complementary with the national identity. A majority of Belgians now feel that they are as much Belgian as they are Dutch or German-speaking. This helps them to stay together. This is how most people in our country see their identity: they think of themselves as Indian as well as belonging to a state or a language group or a social or religious community. Second, it depends on how political leaders raise the demands of any community. It is easier to accommodate demands that are within the constitutional framework and are not at the cost of another community.

Study the table and answer the questions below : State Per Capita income for 2002-03  Punjab Kerala Bihar 		  Which state has the highest per capita income in a year ? 		 Which state has the lowest per capita income in a year ? 		 Which state is better one and why ? ," Punjab has the highest per capita income in a year i.e., ` 26,000  Bihar has the lowest per capita income in one year i.e., ` 5,700  Punjab is better one because its per capita income is more than Bihar. The purchasing power of Punjab is more than Bihar. ","What could these attributes be? Let us examine this through an example. Table 1.3 gives the per capita income of Haryana, Kerala and Bihar. Actually, these figures are of Per Capita Net State Domestic Product at Current Prices for 2016–17. Let us ignore what this complicated term exactly means. Roughly, we can take it to be the per capita income of the state. We find that of the three, Haryana has the highest per capita
 income and Bihar is at the bottom. This means that, on an average, a person in Haryana earned Rs 1,80,174 in one year whereas, on an average, a person in Bihar earned only around Rs 34,409. So, if per capita income were to be used as the measure of development, Haryana will be considered the most developed and Bihar the least developed state of the three. Now, let us look at certain other data pertaining to these states given in Table 1.4.

Now, let us look at certain other data pertaining to these states given in Table 1.4.
 TABLE 1.4 SOME COMPARATIVE DATA ON HARYANA, KERALA AND BIHAR State
 What does this table show? The first column of the table shows that in Kerala, out of 1000 children born, 10 died before completing one year of age but in Haryana the proportion of children dying within one year of birth was 30, which is two times more than that of Kerala. On the other hand, the per capita income of Haryana is more than that of Kerala as shown in Table 1.3. Just think of how dear you are to your parents, think of how every one is so happy when a child is born. Now, try to think of parents whose children die before they even celebrate their first birthday. How painful it must be to these parents? Next, note the year to which this data pertains. It is 2017. So we are not talking of old times; it is 70 years after independence when our metro cities are full of high rise buildings and shopping malls!
 The problem does not end with Infant Mortality Rate. The last column of table 1.4 shows around half of the children aged 14-15 in Bihar are not attending school beyond Class 8. This means that if you went to school in Bihar nearly half of your elementary class would be missing. Those who could have been in school are not there! If this had happened to you, you would not be able to read what you are reading now.
 Kerala has a low Infant Mortality Rate because it has adequate provision of basic health and educational facilities. Similarly, in some states, the
 "
Think of other examples where collective provision of goods and services is cheaper than individual provision. ,"Ans.		Provision of electricity, education and health facilities etc are cheaper as it caters to the collective need of the society.","PUBLIC FACILITIES How is it that the average person in Haryana has more income than the average person in Kerala but lags behind in these crucial areas? The reason is — money in your pocket cannot buy all the goods and services that you may need to live well. So, income by itself is not a completely adequate indicator of material goods and services that citizens are able to use. For example, normally, your money cannot buy you a pollution-free environment or ensure that you get unadulterated medicines, unless you can afford to shift to a community that already has all these things. Money may also not be able to protect you from infectious diseases, unless the whole of your community takes preventive steps.
 Actually for many of the important things in life the best way, also the cheapest way, is to provide these goods and services collectively. Just think – will it be cheaper to have collective security for the whole locality or for each house to have its own security man? What if no one, other than you, in your village or locality is interested in studying? Would you be able to study? Not unless your parents could afford to send you to some private school elsewhere. So you are actually able to study because many other children also want to study and because many people believe that the government should open schools and provide other facilities so that all children have a chance to study. Even now, in many areas, children, particularly girls, are not able to go to high school because the government/ society has not provided adequate facilities.
 of the private sector. Also, collecting money from thousands of people who use these facilities is not easy. Even if they do provide these things they would charge a high rate for their use. Examples are construction of roads, bridges, railways, harbours, generating electricity, providing irrigation through dams etc. Thus, governments have to undertake such heavy spending and ensure that these facilities are available for everyone. There are some activities, which the government has to support. The private sector may not continue their production or business unless government encourages it. For example, selling electricity at the cost of generation may push up the costs of production of goods in many industries. Many units, especially small-scale units, might have to shut down. Government here steps in by producing and supplying electricity at rates which these industries can afford. Government has to bear part of the cost. Similarly, the Government in India buys wheat and rice from farmers at a ‘fair price’. This it stores in its godowns and sells at a lower price to consumers through ration shops. You have read about this in the chapter on Food Security in Class IX. The
 government has to bear some of the cost. In this way, the government supports both farmers and consumers. There are a large number of activities which are the primary responsibility of the government. The government must spend on these. Providing health and education facilities for all is one example. We have discussed some of these issues in the first chapter. Running proper schools and providing quality education, particularly elementary education, is the duty of the government. India’s size of illiterate population is one of the largest in the world. Similarly, we know that nearly half of India’s children are malnourished and a quarter of them are critically ill. We have read about Infant Mortality Rates. The infant mortality rate of Odisha (41) or Madhya Pradesh (47) is higher than some of the poorest regions of the world. Government also needs to pay attention to aspects of human development such as availability of safe drinking water, housing facilities for the poor and food and nutrition. It is also the duty of the government to take care of the poorest and most ignored regions of the country through increased spending in such areas.

Q. 3.		Does availability of good health and educational facilities depend only on amount of money spent by the government on these facilities ? What other factors could be relevant ? ,"Ans.		No, just framing policies and spending money in the health and education facilities does not guarantee the success of the programme, there are other factors that impacts its success.  Effective implementation and monitoring of the policy mechanism by government officials.  Remove corruption from the society.  Curbing socioeconomic inequalities.  Creating a level of awareness about government policies and programmes through local bodies and village communities.","of the private sector.

"Q. 4.		In Tamil Nadu, 75% of the people living in rural areas use a ration shop, whereas in Jharkhand only 8% of rural people do so. Where would people be better off and why ?","Ans.		Health and nutritional status of people depends on availability of cheap and reasonable quality on food grains, sugar and other item from the PDS system. So in Kerala, the people will be better off, since more people there unities the facilities provided by the PDS system.","Kerala has a low Infant Mortality Rate because it has adequate provision of basic health and educational facilities. Similarly, in some states, the
 Public Distribution System (PDS) functions well. Health and nutritional status of people of such states is certainly likely to be better.
 Public Distribution System (PDS) functions well. Health and nutritional status of people of such states is certainly likely to be better.
 LET’S WORK THESE OUT 1. Look at data in Tables 1.3 and 1.4. Is Haryana ahead of Kerala in literacy rate etc., as it is in terms of per capita income? 2. Think of other examples where collective provision of goods and services is cheaper than individual provision. 3. Does availability of good health and educational facilities depend only on amount of money spent by the government on these facilities? What other factors could be relevant? 4. In Tamil Nadu, 90 per cent of the people living in rural areas use a ration shop, whereas in West Bengal only 35 per cent of rural people do so. Where would people be better off and why?

“Agriculture had been the backbone of the Indian economy. But the declining share of agriculture in the GDP is now a matter of serious concern.” Explain the meaning of this statement. ,"Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy because : 3-    In India, about 63% people were engaged in agriculture sector in 2001. Share in GDP was more than 40% in 1973. Raw materials for secondary sectors are mostly supplied by agriculture. But now, the share of agriculture is declining in the GDP year by year. So, it is a matter of serious concern for all.  Share of agriculture in the G.D.P. has declined from 44% to 24% during 1973 to 2003.  The primary sector continues to be the largest employer even in 2000 but the production has not increased by this rate.","Over a long time (more than hundred years), and especially because new methods of manufacturing were introduced, factories came up and started expanding. Those people who had earlier worked on farms now began to work in factories in large numbers. They were forced to do so as you read in history chapters. People began to use many more goods that were produced in factories at cheap rates. Secondary sector gradually became the most important in total production and employment. Hence, over time, a shift had taken place. This means that the importance of the sectors had changed. In the past 100 years, there has been a further shift from secondary to tertiary sector in developed countries. The service sector has become the most important in terms of total production. Most of the working people are also employed in the service sector. This is the general pattern observed in developed countries. What is the total production and employment in the three sectors in India? Over the years have there been changes similar to the pattern observed for the developed countries? We shall see in the next section.
