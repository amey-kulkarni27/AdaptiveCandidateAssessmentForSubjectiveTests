Amoeba reproduces by which process ? Explain in brief.,"Amoeba reproduces by asexual reproduction, binary fission. It begins the process of reproduction by the division of its nucleus in two nuclei. This is followed by division of its body into two, where each part receives a nucleus. Finally two amoebae are produced from one parent amoeba.","Amoeba reproduces by budding.

What is Metamorphosis ? ,The transformation of the larva into an adult through drastic changes is called metamorphosis.,"features that are present in the adult are not found in these young ones. Then what happens to the tadpoles or caterpillars thereafter? You must have seen a beautiful moth emerging out of the cocoon. In the case of tadpoles, they transform into adults capable of jumping and swimming. The transformation of the larva into an adult through drastic changes is called metamorphosis. What about the changes that we observe in our body as we grow? Do you think we too undergo metamorphosis? In human beings, body parts similar to those present in the adults are present from the time of birth.

Write difference between viviparous and oviparous animals.,"Difference between viviparous and oviparous : Viviparous The animals that give birth to young ones are called viviparous animals. e.g., Human beings, Cats, dogs. Oviparous The animals that lay eggs are called oviparous animals. e.g., Frogs, fishes.","place inside the egg shell during this period? After the chick is completely developed it bursts open the egg shell. In animals which undergo external fertilisation, development of the embryo takes place outside the female body. The embryos continue to grow within their egg coverings. After the embryos develop, the eggs hatch. You must have seen numerous tadpoles swimming in ponds and streams. Viviparous and Oviparous Animals We have learnt that some animals give birth to young ones while some animals lay eggs which later develop into young ones. The animals which give birth to young ones are called viviparous animals. Those animals which lay eggs are called oviparous animals. The following activity will help you understand better and differentiate between viviparous and oviparous animals.

How is egg formed in the hen ?,"After fertilization, the zygote divides repeatedly and travels down the oviduct. As it travels down, many protective layers are formed around it. The hard shell is formed","Development of Embryo Fertilisation results in the formation of zygote which begins to develop into an embryo [Fig. 9.8(a)]. The zygote divides repeatedly to give rise to a ball of cells [Fig. 9.8(b)]. The cells then begin to form groups that develop into different tissues and organs of the body. This developing structure is termed an embryo. The embryo gets embedded in the wall of the uterus for further development [Fig. 9.8(c)]. The embryo continues to develop in the uterus. It gradually develops body

Write difference between internal fertilization and external fertilization. ,"External Fertilization Internal fertilization Fertilization that takes place inside the female body is called internal fertilization. e.g., Human, cats, Dogs. Fertilization in which the fusion of a male and a female gamete takes place outside the body of the female is called extenal fertilization. e.g., fish, star fish etc.","You will be surprised to know that in many animals fertilisation takes place outside the body of the female. In these animals, fertilisation takes place in water. Let us find out how this happens.
 Activity 9.1 Visit some ponds or slow-flowing streams during spring or rainy season. Look out for clusters of f r og’s eggs floating in water. Write down the colour and size of the eggs.
 As the eggs are laid, the male deposits sperms over them. Each sperm swims randomly in water with the help of its long tail. The sperms come in contact with the eggs. This results in fertilisation. This type of fertilisation in which the fusion of a male and a female gamete takes place outside the body of the female is called external fertilisation. It is very common in aquatic animals such as fish, starfish, etc.

What is IVF ?,"IVF is In-vitro fertilization. In such cases the doctor collects freshly released egg and sperm and keep them together for a few hours for fertilization. When fertilization occurs, the zygote is formed and allowed to develop for about a week and then, it is placed in the mother’s uterus. Babies born through this technique are called test-tube baby.","Have you heard of test tube babies? Boojho and Paheli’s teacher once told them in the class that in some women oviducts are blocked. These women are unable to bear babies because sperms cannot reach the egg for fertilisation. In such cases, doctors collect freshly released egg and sperms and keep them together for a few hours for IVF or in vitro fertilisation (fertilisation outside the body). In case fertilisation occurs, the zygote is allowed to develop for about a week and then it is placed in the mother’s uterus. Complete development takes place in the uterus and the baby is born like any other baby. Babies born through this technique are called test-tube babies. This term is actually misleading because babies cannot grow in test tubes.

Why the new individual inherits some characteristics from the mother and some from the father ?,The process of fertilization is the meeting of an egg cell from the mother and a sperm cell from the father. So the new individual inherits some characteristics from the mother and some from the father.,"Fertilisation The first step in the process of reproduction is the fusion of a sperm and an ovum. When sperms come in contact with an egg, one of the sperms may fuse with the egg. Such fusion of the egg and the sperm is called fertilisation (Fig. 9.5). During fertilisation, the nuclei of the sperm and the egg fuse to form a single nucleus. This results in the formation of a fertilised egg or zygote (Fig. 9.6). Did

How does external fertilization takes place ? Explain with an example.,"Fertilization in which the fusion of a male and a female gamete takes place outside the body of a female is called external fertilization. It is very common in aquatic animals. During spring or rainy season, frogs and toads move to ponds and slow flowing streams. When the male and female come together in water, the female lays hundreds of eggs. A layer of jelly holds the eggs together and provides protection to the eggs. The male deposits sperm over them. The sperms come in contact with the eggs. This results in fertilization.","As the eggs are laid, the male deposits sperms over them. Each sperm swims randomly in water with the help of its long tail.

 "
Why do fishes and frogs lay eggs in hundreds ?,"This is because the eggs and sperms get exposed to water movement, wind and rainfall. There are other animals in the pond, which may feed on eggs. Thus production of large number of eggs and sperms is necessary to ensure fertilization of atleast a few of them. 3","You will be surprised to know that in many animals fertilisation takes place outside the body of the female.

Define asexual reproduction. Describe two methods of asexual reproduction. ,"Reproduction in which only a single parent is involved is called asexual reproduction. Two methods of asexual reproduction.   Budding  Binary fission  Budding : In hydra there may be one or more bulges. These bulges are developing new individuals and they are called buds. When new individuals develop from the buds, it is called budding.  Binary fission : The process of reproduction by the division of its nucleus into two nuclei. This is followed by division of its body into two where each part receives a nucleus as it finally two amoebae are produced.","In each hydra, there may be one or more bulges. These bulges are the developing new individuals and they are called buds. Recall the presence of buds in yeast. In hydra too the new individuals develop as outgrowths from a single parent.

What are communicable diseases ?,"Microbial diseases that can spread from an infected person to a healthy person through air, water food or physical contact, are called communicable diseases. e.g. cholera, common cold etc.","microorganisms are called pathogens. Some microorganisms spoil food, clothing and leather. Let us study more about their harmful activities. Disease causing Microorganisms in Humans Pathogens enter our body through the air we breathe, the water we drink or the food we eat. They can also get transmitted by direct contact with an infected person or carried by an animal. Microbial diseases that can spread from an infected person to a healthy person through air, water, food or physical contact are called communicable diseases. Examples of such diseases include cholera, common cold, chicken pox and tuberculosis. When a person suffering from common cold sneezes, fine droplets of moisture carrying thousands of viruses are spread in the air. The virus may enter the body of a healthy person while breathing and cause infection.
 There are some insects and animals which act as carriers of diseasecausing microbes. Housefly is one such carrier. The flies sit on the garbage and animal excreta. Pathogens stick to their bodies. When these flies sit on uncovered food they may transfer the pathogens. Whoever eats the contaminated food is likely to get sick. So, it is advisable to always keep food covered. Avoid consuming uncovered items of food. Another example of a carrier is the female Anopheles mosquito (Fig. 2.8), which carries the parasite of malaria (Plasmodium).

Well, though a material may conduct electricity, it may not conduct it as easily as a metal. As a result, the circuit of the tester may be complete and yet the current through it may be too weak to make the bulb glow. Can we make another tester which can detect a weak current? We can use another effect of an electric current to make another kind of tester. Do you recall that electric current produces a magnetic effect? What happens to a compass needle kept nearby when current flows in a wire? Even if the current is small, the deflection of the magnetic needle can be seen. Can we make a tester using the magnetic effect of currents? Let us find out in Activity 14.3.
 Activity 14.3
 You may use an LED (Fig. 14.3) in place of the electric bulb in the tester of Fig. 14.2. LED glows even when a weak electric current flows through it. There are two wires (called leads) attached to an LED. One lead is slightly longer than the other. Remember that while connecting to a circuit, the longer lead is always connected to the positive terminal of the battery and the shorter lead is connected to the negative terminal of the battery.
 A tester is used to check the conduction of electricity through two liquids, labelled A and B. It is found that the bulb of the tester glows brightly for liquid A while it glows very dimly for liquid B. You would conclude that (i) liquid A is a better conductor than liquid B. (ii) liquid B is a better conductor than liquid A. (iii) both liquids are equally conducting. (iv) conducting properties of liquid cannot be compared in this manner.
 "
The bulb does not glow in the setup shown. List the possible reasons. Explain your answer. ,The bulb does not glow due to the following reasons :  Bulb may be fused.  Liquid is non-conducting.  Cells may be used up.  Connections of the circuit may be loose.,"When the liquid between the two ends of the tester allows the electric current to pass, the circuit of the tester becomes complete. The current flows in the circuit and the bulb glows. When the liquid does not allow the electric current to pass, the circuit of the tester is not complete and the bulb does not glow. In some situations even though the liquid is conducting, the bulb may not glow. It may have happened in Activity 14.2. What can be the reason? Do you remember why the bulb glows when the electric current passes through it? Due to the heating effect of current, the filament of the bulb gets heated to a high temperature and it starts glowing.

Prepare a list of objects around you that are electroplated. ,Objects that are generally electro-plated are as follows : — Ornaments. — Wheel rims of vehicles. — Tin cans. — Handles of vehicles. — Electric decorative appliances. — Kitchen gas burner. — Fan blades. — Pots of metals — Utensils etc. — Door and window handles.,"Fig. 14.8 : Some electroplated objects
 silver and gold on less expensive metals. These ornaments have the appearance of silver or gold but are much less expensive. Tin cans, used for storing food, are made by electroplating tin onto iron. Tin is less reactive than iron. Thus, food does not come into contact with iron and is protected from getting spoilt. Iron is used in bridges and automobiles to provide strength. However, iron tends to corrode and rust. So, a coating of zinc is deposited on iron to protect it from corrosion and formation of rust. In the electroplating factories the disposal of the used conducting solution is a major concern. It is a polluting waste and there are specific disposal guidelines to protect the environment. 179

Write a short note on LED.,"LEDs are Light Emitting Diodes. They are used to check electric current. Even when a weak electric current flows through it, they glows. These are available in many colours such as red, green, yellow, blue and white. LEO has two wires, one is longer and the other is shorter. Larger wire is connected with + ve terminal and – ve to the shorter terminals. 2","Did You Know? LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are available in many colours such as red, green, yellow, blue, white and are increasingly being used for many applications, for example in traffic signal lights. LEDs are increasingly being used for lighting. A cluster of white LEDs grouped together forms a LED light source. LED light sources consume less electricity and have longer lifetime than light bulbs and fluorescent tubes. Hence these are gradually becoming the preferred lighting source.

Can some fruits and vegetables conduct electricity ? Explain with an example.,"Some fruits and vegetables also conduct electricity. It is explained with the following example. Potato Fig. Experiment to show Potato conducts electricity Cut a potato into two halves. Insert the copper wires of a tester into it. Keep it for an hour. There appears a greenish blue spot on the potato around one wire. It is because the current produces a chemical effect on potato. Hence, it is clear that vegetables conduct electricity.","Boojho decided to test whether some fruits and vegetables also conduct electricity or not. He cut a potato into two halves and inserted the copper wires of a tester into it. Just then his mother called him and he forgot to take out the wires of the tester inserted into the potato.

Discuss two methods of testing a conductor or an insulator.,"The following methods are used to test the conduction :  The conductivity of substance can be checked by using electric bulb. When the liquid between the two ends of the tester allows the electric current to pass, the circuit of the tester becomes complete. The current flows in the circuit and the bulb glows. If the circuit of tester is not complete the bulb does not glow. This method does not work when current is very small. Lemon Juice Fig. : Testing Conduction of Electricity  We can use another effect of an electric current to test the conduction. A magnetic tester is also used to test conductivity. When current is allowed to pass through it, it creates a magnetic field and the compass shows deflection. The deflection of compass shows that the current is passing through circuit. Magnetic Compass Fig. Testing conduction of Electricity using magnetic compass","When the liquid between the two ends of the tester allows the electric current to pass, the circuit of the tester becomes complete. The current flows in the circuit and the bulb glows. When the liquid does not allow the electric current to pass, the circuit of the tester is not complete and the bulb does not glow. In some situations even though the liquid is conducting, the bulb may not glow. It may have happened in Activity 14.2. What can be the reason? Do you remember why the bulb glows when the electric current passes through it? Due to the heating effect of current, the filament of the bulb gets heated to a high temperature and it starts glowing. However, if the current through a circuit is too weak, the filament does not get heated 173
 sufficiently and it does not glow. And why is the current in the circuit weak? Well, though a material may conduct electricity, it may not conduct it as easily as a metal.

They are not naturally found anywhere else. A particular type of animal or plant may be endemic to a zone, a state or a country. Madhavji shows sal and wild mango (Fig. 7.3 (a)] as two examples of the
 endemic flora of the Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve. Bison, Indian giant squirrel [Fig. 7.3 (b)] and flying squirrel are endemic fauna of this area. Professor Ahmad explains that the destruction of their habitat, increasing population and introduction of new species may affect the natural habitat of endemic species and endanger their existence.

Children are now eager to go there. Madhavji tells them that these reserves are large and diverse enough to protect whole sets of ecosystems. They preserve flora, fauna, landscape and historic objects of an area. Satpura National Park is the first Reserve Forest of India. The finest Indian teak is found in this forest. There are more than one hundred National Parks in India. Rock shelters are also found inside the Satpura National Park. These are evidences of prehistoric human life in these jungles. These give us an idea of the life of primitive people. Rock paintings are found in these shelters. A total of 55 rock shelters have been identified in Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve. Figures of animals and men fighting, hunting, dancing and playing musical instruments are depicted in these paintings. Many tribals still live in the area.

Write in brief about wildlife sanctuary.," Wildlife sanctuaries provide protection and suitable living conditions to wild animals.  Sanctuaries are places where killing  or capturing of animals is strictly prohibited.  Indian sanctuaries have unique landscapes-broad level forests, mountains forests and bush land forests, in deltas of big rivers.  Some of the threatened wild animals such as black buck, white eyed buck, elephant, golden cat and pink headed duck are protected and preserved in our wildlife sanctuaries.  ","To protect our flora and fauna and their habitats, protected areas called wildlife sanctuaries, national parks and biosphere reserves have been earmarked. Plantation, cultivation, grazing, felling trees, hunting and poaching are prohibited there. Wildlife Sanctuary : Areas where animals are protected from any disturbance to them and their habitat. National Park : Areas reserved for wild life where they can freely use the habitats and natural resources. Biosphere Reserve : Large areas of protected land for conservation of wild life, plant and animal resources and traditional life of the tribals living in the area. SCIENCE

 7.7 Wildlife Sanctuary Soon Paheli sees a board with ‘Pachmarhi Wildlife Sanctuary’ written on it. Professor Ahmad explains that killing (poaching) or capturing animals in general is strictly prohibited and punishable by law in all such places. Wildlife Sanctuaries like reserve forests provide protection and suitable living conditions to wild animals. He also tells them that people living in wildlife sanctuaries are allowed to do certain activities such as grazing by their livestock, collecting medicinal plants, firewood, etc. Some of the threatened wild animals like black buck, white eyed buck, elephant, golden cat, pink headed duck, gharial, marsh crocodile, python, rhinoceros, etc., are protected and preserved in our wild life sanctuaries. Indian sanctuaries have unique landscapes—broad level forests, mountain forests and bush lands in deltas of big rivers.

Explain how deforestation leads to reduction rainfall. ,Plants need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. Fewer trees would means that less carbon dioxide is used up resulting in its increased amount in the atmosphere. This leads to global warming as carbon dioxide traps heat rays reflected by the earth. The increase in temperature on the earth disturbs the water cycle and may reduce rainfall.,"the role of carbon dioxide in plants. But if there is excess of CO2 in the air, it acts as a pollutant. Can you help Paheli find out the answer to her question? On the one hand, CO2 is continuously being released because of human activities. On the other hand, area under forests is decreasing. Plants utilise CO2 from the atmosphere for photosynthesis, thereby decreasing the amount of CO2 in the air. Deforestation leads to an increase in the amount of CO2 in the air because the number of trees which consume CO 2 is reduced. Human activities, thus, contribute to the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. CO2 traps heat and does not allow it to escape into space. As a result, the average temperature of the earth’s atmosphere is gradually increasing. This is called global warming. Other gases like methane, nitrous oxide and water vapour also contribute Global Warming A Serious Threat! Global warming can cause sea levels to rise dramatically. In many places, coastal areas have already been flooded. Global warming could result in wide ranging effects on rainfall patterns, agriculture, forests, plants and animals. Majority of people living in regions which are threatened by global warming are in Asia. A recent climate change report gives us only a limited time to keep the greenhouse gases at the present level. Otherwise, the temperature may rise by more than 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, a level considered dangerous.
 decr ease. Moreover, there will be increased chances of natural calamities such as floods and droughts. Recall that plants need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. Fewer trees would mean that less carbon dioxide will be used up resulting in its increased

 amount in the atmosphere. This will lead to global warming as carbon dioxide traps the heat rays reflected by the earth. The increase in temperature on the earth disturbs the water cycle and may reduce rainfall. This could cause droughts. Deforestation is a major cause which leads to the change in soil properties. Physical properties of the soil get affected by plantation and vegetation. Recall from Class VII how trees prevent soil erosion. Fewer trees result in more soil erosion. Removal of the top layer of the soil exposes the lower, hard and rocky layers. This soil has less humus and is less fertile. Gradually the fertile land gets converted into deserts. It is called desertification. Deforestation also leads to a decrease in the water holding capacity of the soil. The movement of water from the soil surface into the ground (infiltration rate) is reduced. So, there are floods. The other properties of the soil like nutrient content, texture etc., also change because of deforestation. We have studied in Class VII that we get many products from forests. List these products. Will we face shortage of these products if we continue cutting trees?
 3. Combustion of most fuels releases carbon dioxide in the environment. Increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the air is believed to cause global warming. Global warming is the rise in temperature of the atmosphere of the earth. This results, among other things, in the melting of polar glaciers, which leads to a rise in the sea level, causing floods in the coastal areas. Low lying coastal areas may even be permanently submerged under water.
 Burning of Fuels Leads to Harmful Products The increasing fuel consumption has harmful effects on the environment. 1. Carbon fuels like wood, coal, petroleum release unburnt carbon For centuries, wood was used as domestic and industrial fuel. But now it has been replaced by coal and other fuels like LPG. In many rural parts of our country, people still use wood as a fuel because of its easy availability and low cost. However, burning of wood gives a lot of smoke which is very harmful for human beings. It causes respiratory problem. Also, trees provide us with useful substances which are lost when wood is used as fuel. Moreover cutting of trees leads to deforestation which is quite harmful to the environment, as you learnt in Class VII.

He tells them that it takes 17 full grown trees to make one tonne of paper. Therefore, we should save paper. Professor Ahmad also tells that paper can be recycled five to seven times for use. If each student saves at least one sheet of paper in a day, we can save many trees in a year. We should save, reuse used paper and recycle it. By this we not only save trees but also save energy and water needed for manufacturing paper. Moreover, the amount of har mful chemicals used in paper making will also be reduced.

How are phases of moon formed ?,"The day on which the whole disc of the moon is visible is known as full moon day. Thereafter, every night the size of the bright part of the moon becomes thinner and thinner. On the fifteenth day the moon is not visible, which is known as new moon day. The next day, only a small portion of the moon appears in the sky, known as crescent and then again the moon grows larger every day. On 15th day again we get full view of the moon. These various shapes are called phases. We see different phases of moon as a result of difference in sunlight reflected by moon. Difference in sunlight incident on moons surface arises due to revolution of moon around the earth.","Is there a change in the shape of the moon everyday? Are there days when the shape of the moon appears to be perfectly round? Are there days when the moon cannot be seen at all even if the sky is clear? The day on which the whole disc of the moon is visible is known as the full moon day. Thereafter, every night the size of the bright part of the moon appears to become thinner and thinner. On the fifteenth day the moon is not visible. This day is known as the ‘new moon day’. The next day, only a small portion of the moon appears in the sky. This is known as the crescent moon. Then again the moon grows larger every day. On the fifteenth day once again we get a full view of the moon. The various shapes of the bright part of the moon as seen during a month are called phases of the moon (Fig. 17.2). Phases of the moon play an important role in our social life. Almost all festivals in India are celebrated according to the phases of the moon. For example, Diwali is celebrated on the new moon day; Budh Poornima and Guru Nanak’s birthday are celebrated on full moon day; Maha Shivratri is celebrated on thirteenth night of waning moon; Eidul-Fitr is observed on the day following the sighting of crescent moon. The time period between one full moon to the next full moon is slightly longer than 29 days. In many calendars this period is called a month.
 Let us try to understand why phases of the moon occur. You have studied in Chapter 16 that the moon does not produce its own light, whereas the Sun and other stars do. We see the moon because the sunlight falling on it gets reflected towards us (Fig. 17.3). We, therefore, see only that part of the moon, from which the light of the Sun is reflected towards us.

For example, a drum vibrates with a low frequency. Therefore, it produces
 The loudness of sound depends on its amplitude. When the amplitude of vibration is large, the sound produced is loud. When the amplitude is small, the sound produced is feeble.

Middle ear has a stretched structure called ear drum. When ears receive sound, it enters down the ear canal and reaches eardrum. Sound vibrations, vibrates the eardrum and it sends vibrations to inner ear from which vibrations are sent to the brain for interpretation of sound.","13.4 We Hear Sound through Our Ears The shape of the outer part of the ear is like a funnel.

Why is the process of loosening and turning of the soil an important task in agriculture ?,This allows the roots to penetrate deep into soil. The loose soil allows the roots to breathe easily deep into the soil and also helps in the growth of earthworms and microbes present in soil as they add humus to it.,"1.3 Preparation of Soil The preparation of soil is the first step before growing a crop. One of the most important tasks in agriculture is to turn the soil and loosen it. This allows the roots to penetrate deep into the soil. The loose soil allows the roots to breathe easily even when they go deep into the soil. Why does the loosening of soil allow the roots to breathe easily? The loosened soil helps in the growth of earthworms and microbes present in the soil. These organisms are friends of the farmer since they further turn and loosen the soil and add humus to it. But why the soil needs to be turned and loosened? You have learnt in the previous classes that soil contains minerals, water, air and some living organisms. In addition, dead plants and animals get decomposed by soil organisms. In this way, various nutrients in the dead organisms are released back into the soil. These nutrients are again absorbed by plants. Since only a few centimetres of the top layer of soil supports plant growth, turning and loosening of soil brings the nutrient-rich soil to the top so that plants can use these nutrients. Thus,
 "
Why is levelling of soil essential ?,The field is levelled for sowing and for irrigation purposes.,"Same kind of plants cultivated at a place constitute a crop. In India, crops can be broadly categorised into two types based on seasons - rabi and kharif crops. It is necessary to prepare soil by tilling and levelling. Ploughs and levellers are used for this purpose. Sowing of seeds at appropriate depths and distances gives good yield. Good variety of seeds are sown after selection of healthy seeds. Sowing is done by seed drills. Soil needs replenishment and enrichment through the use of organic manure and fertilisers. Use of chemical fertilisers has increased tremendously with the introduction of new crop varieties. Supply of water to crops at appropriate intervals is called irrigation. Weeding involves removal of unwanted and uncultivated plants called weeds. Harvesting is the cutting of the mature crop manually or by machines. Separation of the grains from the chaff is called threshing. Proper storage of grains is necessary to protect them from pests and microorganisms. Food is also obtained from animals for which animals are reared. This is called animal husbandry.
 "
What are the advantages of using seed drill ?,Seed drill sows the seeds uniformly at proper distance and depth.,"Are there seeds which float on water? Would those be lighter or heavier than those which sink? Why would they be lighter? Damaged seeds become hollow and are thus lighter. Therefore, they float on water. This is a good method for separating good, healthy seeds from the damaged ones. Before sowing, one of the important tasks is to know about the tools used for sowing seeds [Fig. 1.2 (a), (b)]. Traditional tool : The tool used traditionally for sowing seeds is shaped like a funnel [Fig. 1.2 (a)]. The seeds are filled into the funnel, passed down through two or three pipes having sharp ends. These ends pierce into the soil and place seeds there.
 Selection of Seeds
 Seed drill : Nowadays the seed drill [Fig. 1.2 (b)] is used for sowing with the help of tractors. This sows the seeds uniformly at equal distance and depth. It ensures that seeds get covered by the soil after sowing. This protects seeds from being eaten by birds. Sowing by using a seed drill saves time and labour.
 "
Why fields have to be watered regularly ?,Water is essential because germination of seeds does not take place under dry conditions.,"1.6 Irrigation All living beings need water to live. Water is important for proper growth and development. Water is absorbed by the plant roots. Along with water, minerals and fertilisers are also absorbed. Plants contain nearly 90% water. Water is essential because germination of seeds does not take place under dry conditions. Nutrients dissolved in water are transported to each part of the plant. Water also
 protects the crop from both frost and hot air currents. To maintain the moisture of the soil for healthy crop growth, fields have to be watered regularly. The supply of water to crops at regular intervals is called irrigation. The time and frequency of irrigation varies from crop to crop, soil to soil and season to season. In summer, the frequency of watering is higher. Why is it so? Could it be due to the increased rate of evaporation of water from the soil and the leaves? I am very careful this year about watering the plants. Last summer my plants dried up and died.
 "
How can a farmer increase the fertility of the soil ?,Farmers can increase the fertility of the soil by : — adding manure and fertilizers. — crop rotation. — leaving the field uncultivated in between two crops.,"Soil supplies mineral nutrients to the crop plants. These nutrients are essential for the growth of plants. In certain areas, farmers grow crop after crop in the same field. The field is never left uncultivated or fallow. Imagine what happens to the nutrients? Continuous cultivation of crops makes the soil poor in nutrients. Therefore, farmers have to add manure to the fields to replenish the soil with nutrients. This process is called manuring. Improper or insufficient manuring results in weak plants. Manure is an organic substance obtained from the decomposition of plant or animal wastes. Farmers dump plant and animal waste in pits at open places and allow it to decompose. The decomposition is caused by some microorganisms. The decomposed matter is used as organic manure. You have alr eady learnt about vermicomposting in Class VI. 5
 "
Why is weeding necessary ?,"Weeding is necessary since weeds compete with the crops plants for water, nutrients, space and light. They affect growth of the crop. Some weeds may be poisonous for animals and human beings.","In a field many other undesirable plants may grow naturally along with the crop. These undesirable plants are called weeds. The removal of weeds is called weeding. Weeding is necessary since weeds compete with the crop plants for water, nutrients, space and light. Thus, they affect the growth of the crop. Some weeds interfere even in harvesting and may be poisonous for animals and human beings. Farmers adopt many ways to remove weeds and control their growth. Tilling before sowing of crops helps in uprooting and killing of weeds, which may then dry up and get mixed with the soil. The best time for the removal of weeds is before they produce flowers and seeds. The manual removal includes physical removal of weeds by uprooting or cutting them close to the ground, from time to time. This is done with the help of a khurpi. A seed drill [Fig. 1.2(b)] is also used to uproot weeds. Weeds are also controlled by using certain chemicals, called weedicides, like 2,4-D. These are sprayed in the fields to kill the weeds. They do not damage the crops. The weedicides are diluted with water to the extent required and sprayed in the fields with a sprayer. (Fig. 1.6).

The process of loosening and turning of the soil is called tilling or ploughing. This is done by using a plough. Ploughs are made of wood or iron. If the soil is very dry, it may need watering before ploughing. The ploughed field may have big clumps of soil called crumbs. It is necessary to break these crumbs. Levelling the field is beneficial for sowing as well as for irrigation. Levelling of soil is done with the help of a leveller. Sometimes, manure is added to the soil before tilling. This helps in proper mixing of manure with soil. The soil is moistened before sowing. Agricultural Implements Before sowing the seeds, it is necessary to break soil clumps to get better yield. This is done with the help of various tools. The main tools used for this purpose are the plough, hoe and cultivator.

They do not provide any humus to the soil. ,"better growth of plants? In which glass was the growth fastest? Fertilisers are chemicals which are rich in a particular nutrient. How are they different from manure? Fertilisers are produced in factories. Some examples of fertilisers are— urea, ammonium sulphate, super phosphate, potash, NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium). The use of fertilisers has helped farmers to get better yield of crops such as wheat, paddy and maize. But excessive use of fertilisers has made the soil less fertile. Fertilisers have also become a source of water pollution. Therefore, in order to maintain the fertility of the soil, we have to substitute fertilisers with organic manure or leave the field uncultivated (fallow) in between two crops. The use of manure improves soil texture as well as its water retaining capacity. It replenishes the soil with nutrients. Another method of replenishing the soil with nutrients is through crop rotation. This can be done by growing different crops alternately. Earlier, farmers in northern India used to grow legumes as fodder in one season and wheat in the next season. This helped in the replenishment of the soil with nitrogen. Farmers are being encouraged to adopt this practice. In the previous classes, you have learnt about Rhizobium bacteria. These are present in the nodules of roots of leguminous plants. They fix atmospheric nitrogen.

Write word equation of the reaction involved.," When dilute sulphuric acid is poured on a copper plate, copper reacts with acid to give copper sulphate and hydrogen. Sulphuric acid + Copper    Copper sulphate  +  Hydrogen 1½  When iron nails are placed in copper sulphate solution, displacement reaction takes place in which iron displaces copper. CuSO4 Fe Copper sulphate Iron FeSO4 + Cu Iron sulphate Copper MATERIALS : METALS AND NON-METALS","Activity 14.7 We will need copper sulphate and two copper plates of size around 10 cm × 4 cm. Take 250 mL of distilled water in a clean and dry beaker. Dissolve two teaspoonfuls of copper sulphate in it. Add a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid to copper sulphate solution to make it more conducting. Clean copper plates with sand paper. Now rinse them with water and dry them. Connect the copper plates to the terminals of a battery and immerse them in copper sulphate solution (Fig. 14.7).
 Copper sulphate solution
 When electric current is passed through the copper sulphate solution, copper sulphate dissociates into copper and sulphate. The free copper gets drawn to the electrode connected to the negative terminal of the battery and gets deposited on it. But what about the loss of copper from the solution? From the other electrode, a copper plate, an equal amount of copper gets dissolved in the solution. Thus, the

 Why does an aluminium vessel lose its shining soon after use ?  Can we store lemon pickle in an aluminium utensil ? Explain.," Aluminium is a reactive metal. As it comes in contact with air, it forms a dull layer of aluminium oxide on its surface and hence loses its shine.  No, we cannot store the lemon pickle in aluminium utensils because aluminium is a metal and lemon is acid. The acid reacts with metals to give hydrogen which would spoil the food and make it unfit to use.","Can you store lemon pickle in an aluminium utensil? Explain.

Why cutting vegetables with a blunt knife is not easier ?,"Because of the larger area, smaller the pressure means blunt knife have large area instead of sharp knife. So less pressure will be on vegetable which makes it tough to cut. 2","Try cutting vegetables with a blunt knife and then with a sharp knife. Which is easier? Do you get the feeling that the area over which the force is applied (for example, the pointed end of the nail) plays a role in making these tasks easier? The force acting on a unit area of a surface is called pressure.
 Force could be a push or a pull.

Why is it easy to fix the pointed nail into wooden plank ?,"Because the area of the pointed end of the nail is much smaller than that of its head. The same force, therefore, produces a pressure sufficient to push the pointed end of the nail into the wooden plank.","Note that the area is in the denominator in the above expression. So, the smaller the area, larger the pressure on a surface for the same force. The area of the pointed end of the nail is much smaller than that of its head. The same force, therefore, produces a pressure sufficient to push the pointed end of the nail into the wooden plank. Can you explain now why shoulder bags are provided with broad straps and not thin strap? And, why the tools meant for cutting and piercing always have sharp edges? Do liquids and gases also exert pressure? Does it also depend on the area on which the force acts? Let us find out.

Give two examples of situations in which applied force causes a change in the shape of an object. , We press a balloon to change its shape.  We make chapati from a ball of dough.,"What do you conclude from the observations noted in Table 11.2? What happens when you apply a force on an inflated balloon by pressing it between your palms? What happens to the shape of a ball of dough when it is rolled to make a chapati? What happens when you press a rubber ball placed on a table? In all these examples you saw that the application of force on an object may change its shape. Having performed all the above activities, you would have realised that a force l may make an object move from rest. l may change the speed of an object if it is moving. l may change the direction of motion of an object. l may bring about a change in the shape of an object. l may cause some or all of these effects. While a force may cause one or more of these effects, it is important to remember that none of these actions can take place without the action of a force. Thus, an object cannot move by itself, it cannot change speed by itself, it cannot change direction by itself and its shape cannot change by itself.

Name the forces acting on a plastic bucket containing water held above the ground level in your hand. Discuss why the forces acting on the bucket do not bring a change in its state of motion. ,Muscular force and gravitation forces are acting on the plastic bucket. The force does not bring the change in its state of motion because they are acting in opposite direction with equal magnitudes. The effect of the gravitational force will pull it down if the muscular force grows weak. The body will feel the stretch of gravitational force and will have to bend to cancel the magnitude of gravitational force.,"Objects or things fall towards the earth because it pulls them. This force is called the force of gravity, or just gravity. This is an attractive force. The force of gravity acts on all objects. The force of gravity acts on all of us all the time without our being aware of it. Water begins to flow towards the ground as soon as we open a tap. Water in rivers flows downward due to the force of gravity.

What is atmospheric pressure ? How can we get an idea about the magnitude of atmospheric pressure ?,"The envelop of air surrounding the earth is known as the atmosphere. The pressure exerted by this air is known as atmospheric pressure. The magnitude of atmospheric pressure can be felt by following experiment. Take a good quality rubber sucker. Press it hard on a smooth plane surface. When we press the sucker, most of the air between its cup and surface escapes out. The sucker sticks to the surface because the pressure of atmosphere acts on it. To pull the sucker off the surface, the applied force should be large. This activity might give you an idea about the magnitude of atmospheric pressure. 3","Fig. 11.17 : Atmospheric pressure is the force of gravity on air in a column of unit area

Ü Plastics find extensive use in the healthcare industry. Some examples of their use are the packaging of tablets, threads used for stitching wounds, syringes, doctors’ gloves and a number of medical instruments. Ü Special plastic cookware is used in microwave ovens for cooking food. In microwave ovens, the heat cooks the food but does not affect the plastic vessel. Ü Teflon is a special plastic on which oil and water do not stick. It is used for non-stick coating on cookwares.
 Ü Fire-proof plastics: Although synthetic fibre catches fire easily, it is interesting to know that the uniforms of firemen have coating of melamine plastic to make them flame resistant.
 3.6 Plastics and the Environment When we go to the market, we usually get things wrapped in plastic or packed in polythene bags. That is one reason why plastic waste keeps getting accumulated in our homes. Ultimately, plastic finds its way to the garbage. Disposal of plastic is a major problem. Why? A material which gets decomposed through natural processes, such as action by bacteria, is called biodegradable. A material which is not easily decomposed by natural processes is termed non-biodegradable. Look at Table 3.3.

 When one body rolls over the surface of another body, the resistance to its motion is called rolling friction. Rolling reduces friction. It is always easier to roll than to slide a body over another. That is the reason it is convenient to pull luggage fitted with rollers. Can you now understand why the wheel is said to be one of the greatest inventions of mankind? Since the rolling friction is smaller than the sliding friction, sliding is replaced in most machines by rolling by the use of ball bearings. Common examples are the use of ball bearings between hubs and the axles of ceiling fans and bicycles (Fig. 12.16).

 The frictional force on an object in a fluid depends on its speed with respect to the fluid. The frictional force also depends on the shape of the object and the nature of the fluid. It is obvious that when objects move through fluids, they have to overcome friction acting on them. In this process they lose energy. Efforts are, therefore, made to minimise friction. So, objects are given special shapes. Where do you think scientists get hints for these special shapes? From nature, of course. Birds and fishes have to move about in fluids all the time. Their bodies must have evolved to shapes which would make them lose less energy in overcoming friction. You read about these shapes in Class VI. Look carefully at the shape of an aeroplane (Fig. 12.17). Do you find any similarity in its shape and that of a bird? In fact, all vehicles are designed to have shapes which reduce fluid friction.

What is the cause of friction ?,Friction is caused by the irregularities on the two surfaces in contact. Even those surfaces that appear smooth have a large number of irregularities in them. The irregularity on the two surfaces lock each surface into one another.,"Friction is caused by the irregularities on the two surfaces in contact. Even those surfaces which appear very smooth have a large number of minute irregularities on them (Fig. 12.5). Irregularities on the two surfaces lock into one another. When we attempt to move any surface, we have to apply a force to overcome interlocking. On rough sur faces, there are a larger number of irregularities. So the force of friction is greater if a rough surface is involved.

Friction is called a necessary evil. Why ?,"Friction is called a necessary evil because we cannot do anything without friction and it also shows effects. No movement would come to an end without friction. No body would rest without friction. We cannot write with pen or pencil if there is no friction. If an object starts moving, it would never stop if there was no friction. It is also necessary for grip and bringing movements to rest.","the black board.

Some persons can see objects close to them clearly, but cannot see distant objects so clearly. On the other hand, some persons can not see objects close by clearly, but they can see distant objects quite well. These are called Myopia and Hypermetropia respectively.","Nature has provided eyes with eyelids to prevent any object from entering the eye. Eyelids also shut out light when not required. Eye is such a wonderful instrument that it (normal) can clearly see distant objects as well as objects nearby. The minimum distance at which the eye can see objects distinctly varies with age. The most comfortable distance at which one can read with a normal eye is about 25 cm. Some persons can see objects close to them clearly but cannot see distant objects so clearly. On the other hand, some persons cannot see objects nearby clearly but they can see distant objects quite well. With suitable corrective lenses, these defects of the eye can be corrected. Sometimes, particularly in old age, eyesight becomes foggy. It is due to the eye lens becoming cloudy. When it happens, persons are said to have cataract. There is a loss of vision, sometimes extremely severe. It is possible to treat this defect. The opaque lens is removed and a new artificial lens is inserted. Modern technology has made this procedure simpler and safer.

Write the structure and function of human eye.,"Human eye : The eye has a roughly spherical shape. The outer coat of eye is white. Its transparent front part is called cornea. Behind cornea a dark muscular structure is situated called iris. There is a small opening called the pupil. The size of the pupil is controlled by the iris. The iris controls the amount of light entering into the eye. The lens focuses light on the back of the eye, on a layer called retina. The retina contains several nerve cells. They transmit impulses to the brain through the optic nerve and hence, image is formed. Fig. Human Eye","cornea (Fig. 16.14). Behind the cornea, we find a dark muscular structure called iris.

Carbon fuels like wood, coal, petroleum release unburnt carbon For centuries, wood was used as domestic and industrial fuel. But now it has been replaced by coal and other fuels like LPG. In many rural parts of our country, people still use wood as a fuel because of its easy availability and low cost. However, burning of wood gives a lot of smoke which is very harmful for human beings. It causes respiratory problem. Also, trees provide us with useful substances which are lost when wood is used as fuel. Moreover cutting of trees leads to deforestation which is quite harmful to the environment, as you learnt in Class VII.

"When kerosene oil is heated a little, it will catches fire. But when wood is heated a little, it does not catch fire. Why ?","If kerosene oil is heated a little, it catches fire. But if wood is heated a little, it does not catch fire because ignition temperature of kerosene oil is lower than that of wood.","Do these experiences tell you that different substances catch fire at different temperatures? The lowest temperature at which a substance catches fire is called its ignition temperature. Can you tell now why a matchstick does not catch fire on its own at room temperature? Why does the matchstick start burning on rubbing it on the side of the matchbox? The history of the matchstick is very old. More than five thousand years ago small pieces of pinewood dipped in sulphur were used as matches in ancient Egypt. The modern safety match was developed only about two hundred years ago. A mixture of antimony trisulphide, potassium chlorate and white phosphorus with some glue and starch was applied on the head of a match made of suitable wood. When struck against a rough surface, white phosphorus got ignited due to the heat of friction. This started the combustion of the match. However, white phosphorus proved to be dangerous both for the workers involved in the manufacturing of matches and for the users. These days the head of the safety match contains only antimony trisulphide and potassium chlorate. The rubbing surface has powdered glass and a little red phosphorus (which is much less dangerous). When the match is struck against the rubbing surface, some red phosphorus gets converted into white phosphorus. This immediately reacts with potassium chlorate in the matchstick head to produce enough heat to ignite antimony trisulphide and start the combustion.
 We find that a combustible substance cannot catch fire or burn as long as its temperature is lower than its ignition temperature. Have you ever seen cooking oil catching fire when a frying pan is kept for long on a burning stove? Kerosene oil and wood do not catch fire on their own at room temperature. But, if kerosene oil is heated a little, it will catch fire. But if wood is heated a little, it would still not catch fire. Does it mean that ignition temperature of kerosene oil is lower than that of wood? Does it mean that we need to take special care in storing kerosene oil? The following activity shows that it is essential for a substance to reach ignition temperature to burn.

"Two paper cups, one with water in it and one empty, are heated carefully on candle flame.  What will happen to both the cups ?  Why ?"," The cup containing water will not burn whereas the empty paper cup will burn rapidly.  Because the heat supplied to the paper cup is transferred to water by conduction. So, in the presence of water, the ignition temperature of paper is not reached. Hence, it does not burn. On the other hand the empty paper ’s ignition temperature is low and it burns rapidly.","water paper cups

Explain how CO2 is able to control fire ? ,"For fires, involving electrical equipments and inflammable materials like petrol, carbon dioxide is the best extinguishers. CO2 being heavier than oxygen, covers the fire like a blanket. Since, the contact between the fuel and oxygen is cutoff, the fire is controlled.","The most common fire extinguisher is water. But water works only when things like wood and paper are on fire. If electrical equipment is on fire, water may conduct electricity and harm those trying to douse the fire. Water is also not suitable for fires involving oil and petrol. Do you recall that water is Fig. 6.7 : Fire extinguisher heavier than oil? So, it sinks below the oil, and oil keeps burning on the top. For fires involving electrical equipment and inflammable materials like petrol, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best extinguisher. CO 2, being heavier than oxygen, covers the fire like a blanket. Since the contact between the fuel and oxygen is cut off, the fire is controlled. The added advantage of CO2 is that in most cases it does not harm the electrical equipment. How do we get the supply of carbon dioxide? It can be stored at high pressure as a liquid in cylinders. In what form is the LPG stored in cylinders? When released from the cylinder, CO2 expands enormously in volume and cools down. So, it not only forms a blanket around the fire, it also brings down the temperature of the fuel. That is why it is an excellent fire extinguisher. Another way to get CO 2 is to release a lot of dry powder of chemicals like sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate. Near the fire, these chemicals give off CO2.

How a match stick burns. Explain its process.,"These days the head of the match sticks contains only antimony trisulphide and potassium chlorate. The rubbing surface has powdered glass and a little red phosphorus. When the matchstics is struck against the rubbing surface i.e., some red phosphorus, this immediately reacts with potassium chlorate on the match stick head to produce enough heat to ignite antimony trisulphide and start combustion.","Do these experiences tell you that different substances catch fire at different temperatures? The lowest temperature at which a substance catches fire is called its ignition temperature. Can you tell now why a matchstick does not catch fire on its own at room temperature? Why does the matchstick start burning on rubbing it on the side of the matchbox? The history of the matchstick is very old. More than five thousand years ago small pieces of pinewood dipped in sulphur were used as matches in ancient Egypt. The modern safety match was developed only about two hundred years ago. A mixture of antimony trisulphide, potassium chlorate and white phosphorus with some glue and starch was applied on the head of a match made of suitable wood. When struck against a rough surface, white phosphorus got ignited due to the heat of friction. This started the combustion of the match. However, white phosphorus proved to be dangerous both for the workers involved in the manufacturing of matches and for the users. These days the head of the safety match contains only antimony trisulphide and potassium chlorate. The rubbing surface has powdered glass and a little red phosphorus (which is much less dangerous). When the match is struck against the rubbing surface, some red phosphorus gets converted into white phosphorus. This immediately reacts with potassium chlorate in the matchstick head to produce enough heat to ignite antimony trisulphide and start the combustion.

Disease causing Microorganisms in Humans Pathogens enter our body through the air we breathe, the water we drink or the food we eat. They can also get transmitted by direct contact with an infected person or carried by an animal. Microbial diseases that can spread from an infected person to a healthy person through air, water, food or physical contact are called communicable diseases. Examples of such diseases include cholera, common cold, chicken pox and tuberculosis. When a person suffering from common cold sneezes, fine droplets of moisture carrying thousands of viruses are spread in the air. The virus may enter the body of a healthy person while breathing and cause infection.
 There are some insects and animals which act as carriers of diseasecausing microbes. Housefly is one such carrier. The flies sit on the garbage and animal excreta. Pathogens stick to their bodies. When these flies sit on uncovered food they may transfer the pathogens. Whoever eats the contaminated food is likely to get sick. So, it is advisable to always keep food covered. Avoid consuming uncovered items of food. Another example of a carrier is the female Anopheles mosquito (Fig. 2.8), which carries the parasite of malaria (Plasmodium). Female Aedes mosquito acts as carrier of dengue virus. How can we control the spread of malaria or dengue?

The virus may enter the body of a healthy person while breathing. MICRO-ORGANISMS : FRIEND AND FOE","microorganisms are called pathogens. Some microorganisms spoil food, clothing and leather. Let us study more about their harmful activities. Disease causing Microorganisms in Humans Pathogens enter our body through the air we breathe, the water we drink or the food we eat. They can also get transmitted by direct contact with an infected person or carried by an animal. Microbial diseases that can spread from an infected person to a healthy person through air, water, food or physical contact are called communicable diseases. Examples of such diseases include cholera, common cold, chicken pox and tuberculosis. When a person suffering from common cold sneezes, fine droplets of moisture carrying thousands of viruses are spread in the air. The virus may enter the body of a healthy person while breathing and cause infection.

Why are salt and edible oils also called preservatives ? Name two chemicals that are used as common preservatives.,Salt and edible oils are the common chemicals generally used to check the growth of microorganism. Sodium benzoate and metadisulphate are common preservatives. ,"Chemical Method Salts and edible oils are the common chemicals generally used to check the growth of microorganisms. Therefore they are called preservatives. We add salt or acid preservatives to pickles to prevent the attack of microbes. Sodium benzoate and sodium metabisulphite are common preservatives. These are also used in jams and squashes to check their spoilage. Preservation by Common Salt Common salt has been used to preserve meat and fish for ages. Meat and fish are covered with dry salt to check the growth of bacteria. Salting is also used to preserve amla, raw mangoes, tamarind, etc. Preservation by Sugar Jams, jellies and squashes are preserved by sugar. Sugar reduces the moisture content which inhibits the growth of bacteria which spoil food. Preservation by Oil and Vinegar Use of oil and vinegar prevents spoilage of pickles because bacteria cannot live in such an environment. Vegetables, fruits, fish and meat are often preserved by this method. Heat and Cold Treatments You must have observed your mother boiling milk before it is stored or used. Boiling kills many microorganisms.

Define adolescence. ,"The period of life, when the baby undergoes changes, leading to reproductive maturity, is called adolescence.","Growing up is a natural process. The period of life, when the body undergoes changes, leading to reproductive maturity, is called adolescence. Adolescence begins around the age of 11 and lasts upto 18 or 19 years of age. Since this period covers the ‘teens’ (13 to 18 or 19 years of age), adolescents are also called ‘teenagers’. In girls, adolescence may begin a year or two earlier than in boys. Also, the period of adolescence varies from person to person. The human body undergoes several changes during adolescence. These changes mark the onset of puberty. The most important change which marks puberty is that boys and girls become capable of reproduction. Puberty ends when an adolescent reaches reproductive maturity.
 "
What is menstruation ? Explain. ,"In a woman, during the reproductive age, one ovum matures and is released by one of the ovaries once in about 28 to 30 days. During this period, the wall of uterus becomes thick so as it receives the fertilized egg. If fertilization does not occur, the egg and the thickened lining of uterus along with its blood vessels are sheded off. This causes bleeding in women, and is called menstruation.","Uterus wall
 Ovulation
 10.5 Reproductive Phase of Life in Humans Adolescents become capable of reproduction when their testes and ovaries begin to produce gametes. The capacity for maturation and production of gametes lasts for a much longer time in males than in females. In females, the reproductive phase of life begins at puberty (10 to 12 years of age) and generally lasts till the age of approximately 45 to 50 years. The ova begin to mature with the onset of puberty. One ovum matures and is released by one of the ovaries once in about 28 to 30 days. During this period, the wall of the uterus becomes thick so as to receive the egg, in case it is fertilised and begins to develop. This results in pregnancy. If fertilisation does not occur, the released egg, and the thickened lining of the uterus along with its blood vessels are shed off. This causes bleeding in women which is called menstruation. Menstruation occurs once in about 28 to 30 days. The first menstrual flow begins at puberty and is termed menarche. At 45 to 50 years of age, the menstrual cycle stops. Stoppage of menstruation is termed menopause. Initially, menstrual cycle may be irregular. It take some time to become regular.
 Paheli says that the reproductive life of a woman lasts from menarche to menopause. Is she right?
 Menstrual cycle is controlled by hormones. The cycle includes the maturation of the egg, its release, thickening of uterine wall and its breakdown if pregnancy does not occur. In case the egg is fertilised it begins to divide and then gets embedded in the uterus for further development as you have learnt in Chapter 9 (Fig. 9.8).

What are sex hormones ? Why are they named so ? State their functions. ,"Hormones that control the changes occurring in the body during adolescence are called sex hormones. The male sex hormone testosterone is secreted by testes while female sex hormone estrogen is secreted by ovary. Testosterone causes development of secondary sexual characters in boys such as broadening of chest, growth of hair on face and other parts of the body, enlargement of larynx etc. Estrogen makes the breasts develop, milk secreting glands develop inside the breast. 3","The testes and ovaries secrete sex hormones. You have just learnt that these hormones are responsible for the male and female secondary sexual characters. Further, the sex hormones are under the control of hormones from the pituitary gland (Fig. 10.3). The pituitary secretes many hormones, one of which makes ova mature in the ovaries and sperms form in the testes.
 Both Boojho and Paheli wish to know what initiates changes at puberty.
 The changes which occur at adolescence are controlled by hormones. Hormones are chemical substances. These are secretions from endocrine glands, or endocrine system. The male hormone or testosterone begins to be released by the testes at the onset of puberty. This causes changes in boys about which you have just learnt, for example, the growth of facial hair. Once puberty is reached in girls, ovaries begin to produce the female hormone or estrogen which makes the breasts develop. Milk secreting glands or mammary glands develop inside the breasts. The production of these hormones is under the control of another hormone secreted from an endocrine gland called pituitary gland. Fig. 10.3 : The onset of puberty is controlled by hormones

What is the role of hormones in completing the life history of frogs ?,"In the life cycle of frog the tadpole passes through certain stages to become a frog. It is controlled by thyroxine, the hormone produced by thyroid. It requires the presence of iodine water. If water in which tadpoles are growing does not contain sufficient iodine, the tadpoles cannot become adults.","This change from larva to adult is called metamorphosis (Fig. 9.10). Metamorphosis in insects is controlled by insect hormones. In a frog, it is controlled by thyroxine, the hormone produced by thyroid. Thyroxine production requires the presence of iodine in water. If the water in which the tadpoles are growing does not contain sufficient iodine, the tadpoles cannot become adults.

How is the sex of the baby determined ?,"The sex of the baby is determined by sex chromosomes that are X and Y. In human beings, the female have a pair of XX chromosomes, where as a male body has one ‘X’ and ‘Y’ chromosome. When a sperm containing ‘X’ chromosomes fertilizes the egg, the zygote receives two X chromosomes and develops into a female child. If the sperm contributes a ‘Y’ chromosome to the egg at fertilization the zygote develops into a male child.","10.6 How is the Sex of the Baby Determined?
 I heard my mother and my aunt talking about my cousin who is going to have a baby. They were discussing whether she would give birth to a boy or a girl. I wonder what makes the fertilised egg develop either into a boy or a girl!
 Boy or Girl? Inside the fertilised egg or zygote is the instruction for determining the sex of the baby. This instruction is present in the thread-like structures, called chromosomes in the fertilised egg. Recall from Chapter 8, that chromosomes are present inside the nucleus of every cell. All human beings have 23 pairs of chromosomes in the nuclei of their cells. Two chromosomes out of these are the sex chromosomes, named X and Y. A female has two X chromosomes, while a male has one X and one Y chromosome. The gametes (egg and sperm) have only one set of chromosomes. The unfertilised egg always has one X chromosome. But
 sperms are of two kinds. One kind has an X chromosome, and the other kind has a Y chromosome. See Fig. 10.4. When a sperm containing X chromosome fertilises the egg, the zygote would have two X chromosomes and develop into a female child. If the sperm contributes a Y chromosome to the egg (ovum) at fertilisation, the zygote would develop into a male child.

Earthquake with magnitude 3 will not be so destructive.,"Like many other scales in science (decibel is another example), Richter scale is not linear. This means that an earthquake of magnitude 6 does not have one and half times the destructive energy of an earthquake of magnitude 4. In fact, an increase of 2 in magnitude means 1000 times more destructive energy. Therefore, an earthquake of magnitude 6 has thousand times more destructive energy than an earthquake of magnitude 4.

Describe with the help of a diagram an instrument which can be used to detect a charged body. ,"Electroscope is a device used to detect the presence of charge on an object. — It acts on the principle that like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. — An electroscope has a metal rod with thin metal strip or leaf attached to its bottom. At the top, the rod enters into the glass box. — Charge a refill and touch its top part. When metal strips receive the same charge from the charged refill, they repel each other. Metallic cup Metal rod Metal strips Fig. Electroscope — When they attract each other, it means that a refill charge is opposite charge. Hence, this device can be used to detect whether an object is carrying charge or not. Either they are same or opposite charges.","An electroscope may be used to detect whether a body is charged or not.

Describe green house effect in your own words. ,"Green house effect means warming the environment. A part of the radiation that falls on the Earth is absorbed by it and a part is reflected back into space. A part of the reflected radiation is trapped by the atmosphere. This trapping of radiation increases the temperature and warms up the atmosphere, called atmosphere effect.","and a part is reflected back into space. A part of the reflected radiation is trapped by the atmosphere. The trapped radiations further warm the earth. If you have seen a greenhouse in a nursery or elsewhere, recall that the sun’s heat is allowed to get in but is not allowed to go out. The trapped heat warms the green house. The trapping of radiations by the earth’s atmosphere is similar. That is why it is called the greenhouse effect. Without this process, life would not have been possible on the earth. But now it threatens life. Excess of CO2 in the air is one of the gases responsible for this effect. You know that CO2 is one of the components of air. You have also studied

Prepare a brief speech on global warming. ,"The average temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere is gradually increasing and is called global warming. Excess of CO2 in atmosphere causes pollution. Whereas CO2 is continuously being released because of human activities. Deforestation leads to increase in CO2. This increased CO2 traps the heat and does not allow it to escape into space. As a result the average temperature of the earth’s atmosphere is gradually increasing, and it is called global warming. 2","But how does CO2 content rise in the atmosphere and become excessive?

 the role of carbon dioxide in plants. But if there is excess of CO2 in the air, it acts as a pollutant. Can you help Paheli find out the answer to her question? On the one hand, CO2 is continuously being released because of human activities. On the other hand, area under forests is decreasing. Plants utilise CO2 from the atmosphere for photosynthesis, thereby decreasing the amount of CO2 in the air. Deforestation leads to an increase in the amount of CO2 in the air because the number of trees which consume CO 2 is reduced. Human activities, thus, contribute to the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. CO2 traps heat and does not allow it to escape into space. As a result, the average temperature of the earth’s atmosphere is gradually increasing. This is called global warming. Other gases like methane, nitrous oxide and water vapour also contribute Global Warming A Serious Threat! Global warming can cause sea levels to rise dramatically. In many places, coastal areas have already been flooded. Global warming could result in wide ranging effects on rainfall patterns, agriculture, forests, plants and animals. Majority of people living in regions which are threatened by global warming are in Asia. A recent climate change report gives us only a limited time to keep the greenhouse gases at the present level. Otherwise, the temperature may rise by more than 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, a level considered dangerous.

 towards this effect. Like CO2, they are also called greenhouse gases. Global warming has become a major concern for governments worldwide. Many countries have reached an agreement to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol is one such agreement. Boojho is surprised to hear that an increase in the earth’s temperature by even as little as 0.5 °C can have such a serious effect! Paheli tells him that she had read in the newspapers recently that the Gangotri glacier in the Himalayas has started melting because of global warming.
 3. Combustion of most fuels releases carbon dioxide in the environment. Increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the air is believed to cause global warming. Global warming is the rise in temperature of the atmosphere of the earth. This results, among other things, in the melting of polar glaciers, which leads to a rise in the sea level, causing floods in the coastal areas. Low lying coastal areas may even be permanently submerged under water.

Describe the threat to the beauty of the Taj Mahal. ,"The Taj Mahal is located in Agra. It is made up of white marble. The industries located in and around Agra like rubber processing, automobile, chemicals and especially the Mathura oil Refinery, have been responsible for producing pollutants like SO2 and NO2. These gases react with water vapour and rain, forming acid rain, Acid corrodes the marble of this monument and this is called marble cancer.","18.3 Case Study— The Taj Mahal Over the past 2 decades, India’s most famous tourist attraction, Taj Mahal located in Agra (Fig. 18.4), has become a matter of concern. Experts have warned that pollutants in air are discolouring its white marble. So, it is not only living organisms that get affected by polluted air but non-living things like buildings, monuments and statues also get affected. The industries located in and around Agra like rubber processing, automobile, chemicals and especially the Mathura oil refinery, have been responsible for producing pollutants like sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. These gases react with the water vapour present in the atmosphere to form sulphuric acid and nitric acid. The acids drop down with rain, making the rain acidic. This is called acid rain. Acid rain corrodes the marble of the monument. The phenomenon is also called “Marble cancer”. Suspended particulate matter, such as the soot particles emitted by Mathura oil refinery, has contributed towards the yellowing of the marble. The Supreme Court has taken several steps to save the Taj. It has 241

Why does the increased level of nutrients in the water effect the survival of aquatic organisms ? ,"Excessive quantities of chemical that get washed from the fields by any means such as fertilizers act as nutrient for algae to flourish.

These industries cause chemical contamination of water. The chemicals released include arsenic, lead and fluorides which lead to toxicity in plants and animals. There are regulations to prevent this. Industries are supposed to treat the waste produced before discharging it into waters, but quite often the rules are not followed. The soil is also affected by impure water, causing changes in acidity, growth of worms, etc. We have learnt in Chapter 1 the importance of pesticides and weedicides for the protection of crops. However, all these chemicals dissolve in water and are washed into water bodies from the fields. They also seep into the ground to pollute ground water. Have you seen ponds which look green from a distance because they have a lot of algae growing in them? This is caused by excessive quantities of chemicals which get washed from the fields. These act as nutrients for algae to flourish. Once these algae die, they serve as food for decomposers like bacteria. A lot of oxygen in the water body gets used up. This results in a decrease in the oxygen level which may kill aquatic organisms.

Explain the difference between pure air and polluted air.,"Pure air is free from unwanted particles such as germs, harmful gases, smoke, and excess dust. It should have correct composition of air whereas impure air contains smoke and dust from forest fire, power plants, automobile exhausts and burning of fire wood and cowdung cakes.","One of your observations in the above activity could be the differences in the amount of smoke in the atmosphere. Do you know where the smoke could have come from? Addition of such substances to the atmosphere modifies it. When air is contaminated by unwanted substances which have a harmful effect on both the living and the non-living, it is referred to as air pollution.
 18.2 How does Air Get Polluted? The substances which contaminate the air are called air pollutants. Sometimes, such substances may come from natural sources like smoke and dust arising from forest fires or volcanic eruptions. Pollutants are also added to the atmosphere by certain human activities. The sources of air pollutants are factories (Fig. 18.2), power plants, automobile exhausts and burning of firewood and dung cakes.
