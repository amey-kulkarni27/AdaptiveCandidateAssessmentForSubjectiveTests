Describe in short five methods by which you can increase the yield of crops and livestock. ,Canal system. Such a system receives water from rivers or from one or more reservoirs. It consists of main canals to which are attached many branch canals. These branch canals are connected to distributaries. Distributaries distribute water to the fields.,"India has a wide variety of water resources and a highly varied climate. Under such conditions, several different kinds of irrigation systems are adopted to supply water to agricultural lands depending on the kinds of water resources available. These include wells, canals, rivers and tanks. • Wells: There are two types of wells, namely dug wells and tube wells. In a dug well, water is collected from water bearing strata. Tube wells can tap water from the deeper strata. From these wells, water is lifted by pumps for irrigation. • Canals: This is usually an elaborate and extensive irrigation system. In this system canals receive water from one or more reservoirs or from rivers. The main canal is divided into branch canals having further distributaries to irrigate fields. • River Lift Systems: In areas where canal flow is insufficient or irregular due to inadequate reservoir release, the lift system is more rational. Water is directly drawn from the rivers for supplementing irrigation in areas close to rivers. • Tanks: These are small storage reservoirs, which intercept and store the run-off of smaller catchment areas. Fresh initiatives for increasing the water available for agriculture include rainwater harvesting and watershed management. This involves building small check-dams which lead to an increase in ground water levels. The check-dams stop the rainwater from flowing away and also reduce soil erosion.

 A farmer wants to harvest more than two varieties at a time from his crop field. He has no idea about the cropping patterns. Suggest him one method to get the desired result. Also state three advantages of this cropping pattern.  Name any two fodder crops. , Mixed cropping. Advantages of mixed cropping :  Reduces risk  Insurance against failure of one crop 		 Gives variety in crop yield  Fodder crops : Barseem / Oats / Sudan grass.,"all be of the same variety and germinate under the same conditions. Cultivation practices and crop yield are related to weather, soil quality and availability of water. Since weather conditions such as drought and flood situations are unpredictable, varieties that can be grown in diverse climatic conditions are useful. Similarly, varieties tolerant to high soil salinity have been developed. Some of the factors for which variety improvement is done are: • Higher yield: To increase the productivity of the crop per acre. • Improved quality: Quality considerations of crop products vary from crop to crop. Baking quality is important in wheat, protein quality in pulses, oil quality in oilseeds and preserving quality in fruits and vegetables. • Biotic and abiotic resistance: Crops production can go down due to biotic (diseases, insects and nematodes) and abiotic (drought, salinity, water logging, heat, cold and frost) stresses under different situations. Varieties resistant to these stresses can improve crop production. • Change in maturity duration: The shorter the duration of the crop from sowing to harvesting, the more economical is the variety. Such short durations allow far mers to grow multiple rounds of crops in a year. Short duration also reduces the cost of crop production. Uniform maturity makes the harvesting process easy and reduces losses during harvesting. • Wider adaptability: Developing varieties for wider adaptability will help in stabilising the crop production under dif ferent envir onmental conditions. One variety can then be grown under dif ferent climatic conditions in different areas. • Desirable agronomic characteristics: Tallness and profuse branching are desirable characters for fodder crops. Dwarfness is desired in cereals, so IMPROVEMENT

 that less nutrients are consumed by these crops. Thus developing varieties of desired agronomic characters help give higher productivity.
 15.1.2 (iii) CROPPING PATTERNS Different ways of growing crops can be used to give maximum benefit. Mixed cropping is growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land, for example, wheat + gram, or wheat + mustard, or groundnut + sunflower. This reduces risk and gives some insurance against failure of one of the crops. 207

 What is meant by composite fish culture ?  What is the basis of selecting the different species of fish ?  Which method is used to get pure fish seed ?, Combination of 5 or 6 fish species in a single fish pond.  Species are selected so that they do not compete for food. Food available in all parts of the pond is utilized. This increases fish yield  Hormonal Stimulation  5 Detailed answer :  Composite fish culture is the poly culture system in which combination of 5 or 6 fish species are selected and grown in a single fish bond.  The selection of different species of fish is done so that they do not compete for food and the food available in all the parts of the pond is utilized. This increases the fish yield.  Hormonal stimulation.,"As marine fish stocks get further depleted, the demand for more fish can only be met by such culture fisheries, a practice called mariculture.
 15.2.3 (ii) INLAND FISHERIES Fresh water resources include canals, ponds, reservoirs and rivers. Brackish water resources, where seawater and fresh water mix together, such as estuaries and lagoons are also important fish reservoirs. While capture fishing is also done in such inland water bodies, the yield is not high. Most fish production from these resources is through aquaculture. Fish culture is sometimes done in combination with a rice crop, so that fish are grown in the water in the paddy field. More intensive fish farming can be done in composite fish culture systems. Both local and imported fish species are used in such systems.

 One problem with such composite fish culture is that many of these fish breed only during monsoon. Even if fish seed is collected from the wild, it can be mixed with that of other species as well. So, a major problem in fish farming is the lack of availability of goodquality seed. To overcome this problem, ways have now been worked out to breed these fish in ponds using hormonal stimulation. This has ensured the supply of pure fish seed in desired quantities.

“Continuous use of fertilizers destroys soil fertility”. Hence long term use of fertilizers is substituted by different cropping pattern. Discuss three new techniques of cropping pattern of their significance. ,"Three different cropping patterns, namely mixed cropping, intercropping, and crop rotation are generally practised.  Mixed cropping allows two or more crops to be sowed simultaneously in the same land. Wheat and gram, wheat and mustard, ground nut and sunflower etc. are some common examples of mixed cropping. Mixed cropping also increases soil fertility by maintaining microbial diversity. In mixed cropping, crops are chosen in such a way that they require different amounts of minerals.  Intercropping allow farmers to grow two or more crops simultaneously in the same field in a definite pattern. For example, cauliflower and chilli plants are grown together in alternating rows. To ensure the maximum utilization of nutrients applied, crops are selected in such a way that their nutrient requirements are different. Other examples include soyabean and maize, finger miller  and cowpea  etc.  Crop rotation is the practice of growing two or more varieties of crops in the same region in sequential seasons. A common example of crop rotation is to cultivate maize followed by soyabean. This system also helps in preventing crops from pests and diseases. The crops selected, vary in nutrient requirements. This ensures complete and uniform utilization of nutrients.","15.1.2 (iii) CROPPING PATTERNS Different ways of growing crops can be used to give maximum benefit. Mixed cropping is growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land, for example, wheat + gram, or wheat + mustard, or groundnut + sunflower. This reduces risk and gives some insurance against failure of one of the crops. 207
 Inter-cropping is growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same field in a definite pattern (Fig.15.2). A few rows of one crop alternate with a few rows of a second crop, for example, soyabean + maize, or finger millet (bajra) + cowpea (lobia). The crops are selected such that their nutrient requirements are different. This ensures maximum utilisation of the nutrients supplied, and also prevents pests and diseases from spreading to all the plants belonging to one crop in a field. This way, both crops can give better returns.
 Fig. 15.2 : Intercropping
 The growing of different crops on a piece of land in a pre-planned succession is known as crop rotation. Depending upon the duration, crop rotation is done for different crop combinations. The availability of moisture and irrigation facilities decide the choice of the crop to be cultivated after one harvest. If crop rotation is done properly then two or three crops can be grown in a year with good harvests.

 List the different ways in which biotic and abiotic factors affect stored food grains ?   What preventive and controlling measures need to be taken before and after storing the grains ?  Name two weeds. ," Biotic factors like insects, rodents, fungi, mites and abiotic factors like inappropriate temperature and moisture cause degradation in quality, loss in weight, poor germination, discolouration of produce, all leading to poor marketability.  The preventive and control measures include strict cleaning of the produce before storage, proper drying of the produce first in sunlight and then in shade and fumigation using chemicals.  Xanthium and Parthenium.","15.1.3 CROP PROTECTION MANAGEMENT Field crops are infested by a large number of weeds, insect pests and diseases. If weeds and pests are not controlled at the appropriate time then they can damage the crops so much that most of the crop is lost. Weeds are unwanted plants in the cultivated field, for example, Xanthium
 (gokhroo), Parthenium (gajar ghas), Cyperinus rotundus (motha). They compete for food, space and light. Weeds take up nutrients and reduce the growth of the crop. Therefore, removal of weeds from cultivated fields during the early stages of crop growth is essential for a good harvest. Generally insect pests attack the plants in three ways: (i) they cut the root, stem and leaf, (ii) they suck the cell sap from various parts of the plant, and (iii) they bore into stem and fruits. They thus affect the health of the crop and reduce yields. Diseases in plants are caused by pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and viruses. These pathogens can be present in and transmitted through the soil, water and air. Weeds, insects and diseases can be controlled by various methods. One of the most commonly used methods is the use of pesticides, which include herbicides, insecticides and fungicides. These chemicals are sprayed on crop plants or used for treating seeds and soil. However, excessive use of these chemicals creates problems, since they can be poisonous to many plant and animal species and cause environmental pollution. Weed control methods also include mechanical removal. Preventive methods such as proper seed bed preparation, timely sowing of crops, intercropping and crop rotation also help in weed control. Some other preventive measures against pests are the use of resistant varieties, and summer ploughing, in which fields are ploughed deep in summers to destroy weeds and pests.
 Storage losses in agricultural produce can be very high. Factors responsible for such losses are biotic— insects, rodents, fungi, mites and bacteria, and abiotic— inappropriate moisture and temperatures in the place of storage. These factors cause degradation in quality, loss in weight, poor germinability, discolouration of produce, all leading to poor marketability. These factors can be controlled by proper treatment and by systematic management of warehouses. Preventive and control measures are used before grains are stored for future use. They include strict cleaning of the produce before storage, proper drying of the produce first in sunlight and then in shade, and fumigation using chemicals that can kill pests.

It is rich in organic matter and nutrients. Compost is also prepared by using earthworms to hasten the process of decomposition of plant and animal refuse. This is vermicompost. Green Manure : Manure prepared by the green plants like sunhemp or guar that are grown prior to the sowing of the crop seeds.   Appropriate vaccination. 		 Spraying of disinfectants at regular intervals. 		 Proper cleaning, sanitation, hygienic conditions in housing and poultry feed.  2 + 3","MANURE Manure contains large quantities of organic matter and also supplies small quantities of nutrients to the soil. Manure is prepared by the decomposition of animal excreta and plant waste. Manure helps in enriching soil with nutrients and organic matter and increasing soil fertility. The bulk of organic matter in manure helps in improving the soil structure. This involves increasing the water holding capacity in sandy soils. In clayey soils, the large quantities of organic matter help in drainage and in avoiding water logging. In using manure we use biological waste material, which is advantageous in protecting
 our environment from excessive use of fertilizers. Using biological waste material is also a way of recycling farm waste. Based on the kind of biological material used, manure can be classified as: (i) Compost and vermi-compost: The process in which farm waste material like livestock excreta (cow dung etc.), vegetable waste, animal refuse, domestic waste, sewage waste, straw, eradicated weeds etc. is decomposed in pits is known as composting. The compost is rich in organic matter and nutrients. Compost is also prepared by using earthworms to hasten the process of decomposition of plant and animal refuse. This is called vermicompost. (ii) Green manure: Prior to the sowing of the crop seeds, some plants like sun hemp or guar are grown and then mulched by ploughing them into the soil. These green plants thus turn into green manure which helps in enriching the soil in nitrogen and phosphorus.

"The quantity and the quality of food is decreasing day by day. As population is increasing drastically, mention the steps taken to improve this condition.",The following steps should be taken to improve the conditions of food :  By selecting good hybrid varieties of crop having desirable agronomic traits.  The field should be kept fertile and nutrient rich and it should be managed properly.  By using high yielding variety seeds for high yield per acre.  By using a beneficial cropping pattern either mixed cropping or crop rotation.  By improving the irrigation facilities.,"Chapter 15 IMPROVEMENT IN FOOD RESOURCES We know that all living organisms need food. Food supplies proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals, all of which we require for body development, growth and health. Both plants and animals are major sources of food for us. We obtain most of this food from agriculture and animal husbandry. We read in newspapers that efforts are always being made to improve production from agriculture and animal husbandry. Why is this necessary? Why we cannot make do with the current levels of production? India is a very populous country. Our population is more than one billion people, and it is still growing. As food for this growing population, we will soon need more than a quarter of a billion tonnes of grain every year. This can be done by farming on more land. But India is already intensively cultivated. As a result, we do not have any major scope for increasing the area of land under cultivation. Therefore, it is necessary to increase our production efficiency for both crops and livestock. Efforts to meet the food demand by increasing food production have led to some successes so far. We have had the green revolution, which contributed to increased food-grain production. We have also had the white revolution, which has led to better and more efficient use as well as availability of milk. However, these revolutions mean that our natural resources are getting used more intensively. As a result, there are more chances of causing damage to our natural resources to the point of destroying their balance completely. Therefore, it is important that we should increase food production without degrading our environment and disturbing the balances maintaining it.

 Hence, there is a need for sustainable practices in agriculture and animal husbandry. Also, simply increasing grain production for storage in warehouses cannot solve the problem of malnutrition and hunger. People should have money to purchase food. Food security depends on both availability of food and access to it. The majority of our population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. Increasing the incomes of people working in agriculture is therefore necessary to combat the problem of hunger. Scientific management practices should be undertaken to obtain high yields from far ms. For sustained livelihood, one should undertake mixed farming, intercropping, and integrated farming practices, for example, combine agriculture with livestock/poultry/fisheries/ bee-keeping. The question thus becomes – how do we increase the yields of crops and livestock?

Let us compare their structure and functions. Do plants and animals have the same structure? Do they both perform similar functions?
 There are noticeable differences between the two. Plants are stationary or fixed – they don’t move. Since they have to be upright, they have a large quantity of supportive tissue. The supportive tissue generally has dead cells. Animals on the other hand move around in search of food, mates and shelter. They consume more energy as compared to plants.

The growth in plants is limited to certain regions, while this is not so in animals. There are some tissues in plants that divide throughout their life.

 There are noticeable differences between the two. Plants are stationary or fixed – they don’t move. Since they have to be upright, they have a large quantity of supportive tissue. The supportive tissue generally has dead cells. Animals on the other hand move around in search of food, mates and shelter. They consume more energy as compared to plants.

Describe the structure of the plant cell. ,"A plant cell consists of : 1. Cell wall : The outermost covering made mainly of non-living cellulose which gives distinct shape to the cell. 2. Plasma membrane : It is also called cell membrane. It is a thin, delicate and elastic covering lying inner to the cell wall. It controls the entry and exit of selected molecules and ions, and is selectively permeable. Cytoplasm : It is a viscous, homogeneous colloidal liquid and consists of a number of living and non-living structures. The living structures are the cell organelles and include structures like mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, vacuoles etc. Cytoplasm keeps the cell fully expanded and provides turgidity to the cell. Chloroplasts are present only in the cytoplasm of plant cell. 4. Nucleus : It is dense spherical body bounded by a membrane which is called nuclear membrane. A number of thread-like structures called chromosomes with genes on them are embedded within the nuclear sap. The nucleus controls the various metabolic activities of the cell and so is called the control centre of the cell. For diagram See Q. No. 2 SAQ ","The fundamental organisational unit of life is the cell. Cells are enclosed by a plasma membrane composed of lipids and proteins. The cell membrane is an active part of the cell. It regulates the movement of materials between the ordered interior of the cell and the outer environment. In plant cells, a cell wall composed mainly of cellulose is located outside the cell membrane. The presence of the cell wall enables the cells of plants, fungi and bacteria to exist in hypotonic media without bursting. The nucleus in eukaryotes is separated from the cytoplasm by double-layered membrane and it directs the life processes of the cell. The ER functions both as a passageway for intracellular transport and as a manufacturing surface. The Golgi apparatus consists of stacks of membrane-bound vesicles that function in the storage, modification and packaging of substances manufactured in the cell. Most plant cells have large membranous organelles called plastids, which are of two types – chromoplasts and leucoplasts.

 The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a large network of membrane-bound tubes and sheets. It looks like long tubules or round or oblong bags (vesicles). The ER membrane is similar in structure to the plasma membrane. There are two types of ER– rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). RER looks rough under a microscope because it has particles called ribosomes attached to its surface. The ribosomes, which are present in all active cells, are the sites of protein manufacture. The manufactured proteins are then sent to various places in the cell depending on need, using the ER. The SER helps in the manufacture of fat molecules, or lipids, important for cell function. Some of these proteins and lipids help in building the cell membrane. This pr ocess is known as membrane biogenesis. Some other proteins and lipids function as enzymes and hormones. Although the ER varies greatly in appearance in different cells, it always forms a network system.
 5.2.5 CELL ORGANELLES Every cell has a membrane around it to keep its own contents separate from the external environment. Large and complex cells, including cells from multicellular organisms, need a lot of chemical activities to support their complicated structure and function. To keep these activities of different kinds separate from each other, these cells use membrane-bound little structures (or ‘organelles’) within themselves. This is one of the features of the eukaryotic cells that distinguish them from prokaryotic cells. Some of these organelles are visible only with an electron microscope. We have talked about the nucleus in a previous section. Some important examples of cell organelles which we will discuss now are: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, mitochondria and plastids. They are important because they carry out some very crucial functions in cells. THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT

State the meaning of sustainable agriculture. Name the scientific practices that you can undertake to obtain higher yield from agriculture. ,Definition of sustainable agriculture.  Mixed farming  Intercropping  Crop rotation ,"Organic farming is a farming system with minimal or no use of chemicals as fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides etc. and with a maximum input of organic manures, recyled farm wastes, and bio-agents, with healthy cropping systems. Mixed farming is a system of farming on a particular farm which includes crop production, raising of livestock etc. Mixed cropping is growing of two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land. Growing two or more crops in definite row patterns is known as inter-cropping. The growing of different crops on a piece of land in pre-planned succession is called crop rotation. Varietal improvement is required for higher yield, good quality, biotic and abiotic resistance, shortening the maturity duration, wider adaptability and desirable agronomic characteristics. Farm animals require proper care and management such as shelter, feeding, breeding and disease control. This is called animal husbandry. Poultry farming is done to raise domestic fowls. Poultry production includes egg production and broiler production for poultry meat. To enhance poultry production, cross breeding is done between Indian and exotic breeds for variety improvement. Fish may be obtained from marine resources as well as inland resources. To increase production of fish, they can be cultured in marine and inland ecosystems. Marine fish capture is done by fishing nets guided by echosounders and satellites. Composite fish culture system is commonly used for fish farming. Bee-keeping is done to get honey and wax.

Animal feed includes: (a) roughage, which is largely fibre, and (b) concentrates, which are low in fibre and contain relatively high levels of proteins and other nutrients. Cattle need balanced rations containing all nutrients in proportionate amounts. Besides such nutritious food material, certain feed additives containing micronutrients promote the health and milk output of dairy animals. Cattle suffer from a number of diseases. The diseases, besides causing death, reduce milk production. A healthy animal feeds regularly and has a normal posture. The parasites of cattle may be both external parasites and internal parasites. The external parasites live on the skin and mainly cause skin diseases. The internal parasites like worms, affect stomach and intestine while flukes damage the liver. Infectious diseases are also caused by bacteria and viruses. Vaccinations are given to farm animals against many major viral and bacterial diseases.

 Define melting point. Describe an activity with labelled diagram to find melting point of ice.  Explain why temperature remains same during melting of ice. ," Melting point of a solid is defined as the temperature at which a solid melts to become a liquid at the atmospheric pressure. Activity : l Take about 150 g of ice in a beaker and suspend a laboratory thermometer so that its bulb is in contact with the ice. l Start heating the beaker on a low flame. l Note the temperature when the ice starts melting. 5 Marks each Note the temperature when all the ice has converted into water. l Record your observations for this conversion of solid to liquid state. l Now, put a glass rod in the beaker and heat while stirring till the water starts boiling. l Keep a careful eye on the thermometer reading till most of the water had vaporised. l Record observations.  The temperature remains constant during the melting of ice even though heat is supplied regularly as the temperature is supplied for changing the state of matter. The heat of temperature is consumed by the particles of ice and they vibrate faster and breaks the force of attraction and becomes liquid. Thermometer Iron stand Glass stirrer Beaker Ice Burner  Iron stand Thermometer Glass stirrer Beaker Water Burner ","On increasing the temperature of solids, the kinetic energy of the particles increases. Due to the increase in kinetic energy, the particles start vibrating with greater speed. The energy supplied by heat overcomes the forces of attraction between the particles. The particles leave their fixed positions and start moving more freely. A stage is reached when the solid melts and is converted to a liquid. The minimum temperature at which a solid melts to become a liquid at the atmospheric pressure is called its melting point. The melting point of a solid is an indication of the strength of the force of attraction between its particles. The melting point of ice is 273.15 K*. The process of melting, that is, change of solid state into liquid state is also known as fusion. When a solid melts, its temperature remains the same, so where does the heat energy go? You must have observed, during the experiment of melting, that the temperature of the system does not change after the melting point is reached, till all the ice melts. This happens even though we continue to heat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply heat. This heat gets used up in changing the
 state by overcoming the forces of attraction between the particles. As this heat energy is absorbed by ice without showing any rise in temperature, it is considered that it gets hidden into the contents of the beaker and is known as the latent heat. The word latent means hidden. The amount of heat energy that is required to change 1 kg of a solid into liquid at atmospheric pressure at its melting point is known as the latent heat of fusion. So, particles in water at 00 C (273 K) have more energy as compared to particles in ice at the same temperature. When we supply heat energy to water, particles start moving even faster. At a certain temperature, a point is reached when the particles have enough energy to break free from the forces of attraction of each other. At this temperature the liquid starts changing into gas. The temperature at which a liquid starts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is known as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk phenomenon. Particles from the bulk of the liquid gain enough energy to change into the vapour state. For water this temperature is 373 K (100 0C = 273 + 100 = 373 K). Can you define the latent heat of vaporisation? Do it in the same way as we have defined the latent heat of fusion. Particles in steam, that is, water vapour at 373 K (1000 C) have more energy than water at the same temperature. This is because particles in steam have absorbed extra energy in the form of latent heat of vaporisation.

Why do ice-cream appears colder than water at the same temperature ?," Evaporation is a surface phenomenon. Particles from the surface gain enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction present in the liquid and change into vapour state. 		 Due to wet cloth the temperature is comparatively lower than room temperature so butter does not melt when remain wrapped in wet cloths.  Ice cream at 273 K, it will take latent heat from the medium to convert itself into liquid at 273 K and then into liquid at higher temperature but in water such condition is not possible.  5","Evaporation is a surface phenomenon.

Boiling of liquid takes place at its Boiling point, whereas evaporation can occurs at any temperature or room temperature.  1 + 2 + 2  280 – 273 = 7°C","What happens when you pour some acetone (nail polish remover) on your palm? The particles gain energy from your palm or surroundings and evaporate causing the palm to feel cool. After a hot sunny day, people sprinkle water on the roof or open ground because the large latent heat of vaporisation of water helps to cool the hot surface. Can you cite some more examples from daily life where we can feel the effect of cooling due to evaporation? Why should we wear cotton clothes in summer? During summer, we perspire more because of the mechanism of our body which keeps us cool. We know that during evaporation, the particles at the surface of the liquid gain energy from the surroundings or body surface and change into vapour. The heat energy equal to the latent heat of vaporisation is absorbed from the body leaving the body cool. Cotton, being a good absorber of water helps in absorbing the sweat and exposing it to the atmosphere for easy evaporation.

Doctors advise to put strips of wet cloth on the forehead of a person having high fever. "," Particles of sugar crystals occupy the space between the particles of water.  The excess heat from the body is taken by high latent heat of vaporization of water. As a result, temperature of body decreases.  Sublimation, naphthalene gets converted into vapours.  Because a wooden table has a fixed shape as well as fixed volume and it is uncompressible also.  Evaporation of saliva causes cooling. ","COOLING?
 In an open vessel, the liquid keeps on evaporating. The particles of liquid absorb energy from the surrounding to regain the energy lost during evaporation. This absorption of energy from the surroundings make the surroundings cold.

Due to the increase in kinetic energy, the particles start vibrating with greater speed. The energy supplied by heat overcomes the forces of attraction between the particles. The particles leave their fixed positions and start moving more freely. A stage is reached when the solid melts and is converted to a liquid. The minimum temperature at which a solid melts to become a liquid at the atmospheric pressure is called its melting point. The melting point of a solid is an indication of the strength of the force of attraction between its particles. The melting point of ice is 273.15 K*. The process of melting, that is, change of solid state into liquid state is also known as fusion. When a solid melts, its temperature remains the same, so where does the heat energy go? You must have observed, during the experiment of melting, that the temperature of the system does not change after the melting point is reached, till all the ice melts. This happens even though we continue to heat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply heat. This heat gets used up in changing the
 state by overcoming the forces of attraction between the particles.

So, particles in water at 00 C (273 K) have more energy as compared to particles in ice at the same temperature. When we supply heat energy to water, particles start moving even faster. At a certain temperature, a point is reached when the particles have enough energy to break free from the forces of attraction of each other. At this temperature the liquid starts changing into gas. The temperature at which a liquid starts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is known as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk phenomenon. Particles from the bulk of the liquid gain enough energy to change into the vapour state. For water this temperature is 373 K (100 0C = 273 + 100 = 373 K). Can you define the latent heat of vaporisation? Do it in the same way as we have defined the latent heat of fusion. Particles in steam, that is, water vapour at 373 K (1000 C) have more energy than water at the same temperature.

"State Newton’s first law of motion. Show that Newton’s first law of motion is a special case of Newton’s second law. Determine the acceleration of a car of mass 800 kg, on application of a force of 200 N on it. ",Statement of Newton first law of motion : See,"Newton further studied Galileo’s ideas on force and motion and presented three fundamental laws that govern the motion of objects. These three laws are known as Newton’s laws of motion. The first law of motion is stated as: An object remains in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change that state by an applied force. In other words, all objects resist a change in their state of motion. In a qualitative way, the tendency of undisturbed objects to stay at rest or to keep moving with the same velocity is called inertia. This is why, the first law of motion is also known as the law of inertia. Certain experiences that we come across while travelling in a motorcar can be explained on the basis of the law of inertia. We tend to remain at rest with respect to the seat until the driver applies a braking force to stop the motorcar. With the application of brakes, the car slows down but our body tends to continue in the same state of motion because of its inertia. A sudden application of brakes may thus cause injury to us by

We know that it is easier to push an empty box than a box full of books. Similarly, if we kick a football it flies away. But if we kick a stone of the same size with equal force, it hardly moves.

 box with a small force, the box does not move because of friction acting in a direction opposite to the push [Fig. 9.4(a)]. This friction force arises between two surfaces in contact; in this case, between the bottom of the box and floor’s rough surface. It balances the pushing force and therefore the box does not move. In Fig. 9.4(b), the children push the box harder but the box still does not move. This is because the friction force still balances the pushing force. If the children push the box harder still, the pushing force becomes bigger than the friction force [Fig. 9.4(c)]. There is an unbalanced force. So the box starts moving. What happens when we ride a bicycle? When we stop pedalling, the bicycle begins to slow down. This is again because of the friction forces acting opposite to the direction of motion. In order to keep the bicycle moving, we have to start pedalling again. It thus appears that an object maintains its motion under the continuous application of an unbalanced force. However, it is quite incorrect. An object moves with a uniform velocity when the forces (pushing force and frictional force) acting on the object are balanced and there is no net external force on it. If an unbalanced force is applied on the object, there will be a change either in its speed or in the direction of its motion. Thus, to accelerate the motion of an object, an unbalanced force is required. And the change in its speed (or in the direction of motion) would continue as long as this unbalanced force is applied.

 Fig. 9.3 shows a wooden block on a horizontal table. Two strings X and Y are tied to the two opposite faces of the block as shown. If we apply a force by pulling the string X, the block begins to move to the right. Similarly, if we pull the string Y, the block moves to the left. But, if the block is pulled from both the sides with equal forces, the block will not move. Such forces are called balanced forces and do not change the state of rest or of motion of an object. Now, let us consider a situation in which two opposite forces of different magnitudes pull the block. In this case, the block would begin to move in the direction of the greater force. Thus, the two forces are not balanced and the unbalanced force acts in the direction the block moves. This suggests that an unbalanced force acting on an object brings it in motion.

The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied on it and the change takes place in the direction of applied force. Suppose a body of mass m is acted on by a force F. Mathematical derivation : If the force ‘F’ changes its velocity from u to v in time t, then rate of change of momentum can be written as  t m t This is equal to the force applied on the body by m  second law t Hence, F = ma m = 500 g = 0·5 kg, v =0 t = 0·01 s Acceleration of hammer = u = 50 m/s, a = – 5000 m/s2 		Force applied by the nail on hammer f = ma = 0·5 ×  			 = – 2500 N.","change the momentum of an object depends on the time rate at which the momentum is changed.

 State the law that provides the formula for measuring force and the law which provides the definition of force.  Velocity time graph of a 50 g marble rolling on a floor is given below. Find : 		 time in which it stops. 		 negative acceleration produced on it. 		 positive force acting on the marble  ,"The force acting on a body is directly proportional to the rate of change of momentum of the body, according to Newton’s second law. Force is equal to 1 newton if it produces an acceleration of 1 m/s2 in a body of unit mass.  By reducing the speed of hand suddenly, the player decreases the time of change of momentum. This increases the impact of force exerted on the tile.  When athletes fall on a soft surface, their velocity becomes zero in a longer duration of time. Thus, rate of momentum change decreases and less force is exerted by ground on their body. V el oci t y ","motion gives us a method to measure the force acting on an object as a product of its mass and acceleration. The second law of motion is often seen in action in our everyday life. Have you noticed that while catching a fast moving cricket ball, a fielder in the ground gradually pulls his hands backwards with the moving ball? In doing so, the fielder increases the time during which the high velocity of the moving ball decreases to zero. Thus, the acceleration of the ball is decreased and therefore the impact of catching the fast moving ball (Fig. 9.8) is also reduced. If the ball is stopped suddenly then its high velocity decreases to zero in a very short interval of time. Thus, the rate of change of momentum of the ball will be large. Therefore, a large force would have to be applied for holding the catch that may hurt the palm of the fielder. In a high jump athletic event, the athletes are made to fall either on a cushioned bed or on a sand bed. This is to increase the time of the athlete’s fall to stop after making the jump. This decreases the rate of change of momentum and hence the force. Try to ponder how a karate player breaks a slab of ice with a single blow.

You must accelerate, and this requires a force in accordance with the second law of motion. Which is this force? Is it the muscular effort you exert on the road? Is it in the direction we intend to move? No, you push the road below backwards. The road exerts an equal and opposite force on your feet to make you move forward. It is important to note that even though the action and reaction forces are always equal in magnitude, these forces may not produce accelerations of equal magnitudes. This is because each force acts on a different object that may have a different mass. When a gun is fired, it exerts a forward force on the bullet. The bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun. This results in the recoil of the gun (Fig. 9.11). Since the gun has a much greater mass than the bullet, the acceleration of the gun is much less than the acceleration of the bullet. The third law of motion can also be illustrated when a sailor jumps out of a rowing boat. As the sailor jumps forward, the force on the boat moves it backwards (Fig. 9.12).

",  During transport if there are jerks then straw being soft gets compressed and increases the time of change of momentum. So impact on glass would be reduced.

"Look at the diagram above and answer the following questions : Wall Reaction 4N Spring balance Action 4N   When a force is applied through the free end of the spring balance A the reading on the spring balance A is 20 gwt. What will be the reading shown by the spring balance B ?  Write reasons for your answer. 		 If a balloon is filled with air and its mouth untied, air is released from its mouth in the downward direction. Write the other observations made by you. Justify your answer. ","  Spring balance B will also show 20 gwt. 		 It is because of Newton’s III law of motion, when spring balance A exerts force on the balance B then the balance B pulls the balance A with an equal force of 20 gwt, but in the opposite direction. Balance A exerts a force of action on balance B then balance B exerts an equal and opposite force of reaction on balance A. 		 It is observed that the balloon moves in the upward direction as air comes out from the balloon. It performs an action in the downward direction as a result of which there will be a reaction (equal in magnitude but opposite in direction) in the form of upward motion. ","9.5 Third Law of Motion The first two laws of motion tell us how an applied force changes the motion and provide us with a method of determining the force. The third law of motion states that when one object exerts a force on another object, the second object instantaneously exerts a force back on the first. These two forces are always equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. These forces act on different objects and never on the same object. In the game of football sometimes we, while looking at the football and trying to kick it with a greater force, collide with a player of the opposite team. Both feel hurt because each applies a force to the other. In other words, there is a pair of forces and not just one force. The two opposing forces are also known as action and reaction forces. Let us consider two spring balances connected together as shown in Fig. 9.10. The fixed end of balance B is attached with a rigid support, like a wall. When a force is applied through the free end of spring balance A, it is observed that both the spring balances show the same readings on their scales. It means that the force exerted by spring balance A on balance B is equal but opposite in direction to the force exerted by the balance B on balance A. Any of these two forces can be called as action and the other as reaction. This gives us an alternative statement of the third law of motion i.e., to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. However, it must be remembered that the action and reaction always act on two different objects, simultaneously.

Solution: From Eq. (9.4), we have F = ma. Here we have m1 = 2 kg; a1 = 5 m s-2 and m2 = 4 kg; a2 = 2 m s-2. Thus, F1 = m1a1 = 2 kg × 5 m s-2 = 10 N; and F2 = m2a2 = 4 kg × 2 m s-2 = 8 N. ⇒ F1 > F2. Thus, accelerating a 2 kg mass at 5 m s-2 would require a greater force. Example 9.3 A motorcar is moving with a velocity of 108 km/h and it takes 4 s to stop after the brakes are applied. Calculate the force exerted by the brakes on the motorcar if its mass along with the passengers is 1000 kg.
 Solution: From Eq. (9.4) we have m1 = F/a1; and m2 = F/a2. Here, a1 = 10 m s-2; a2 = 20 m s-2 and F = 5 N. Thus, m1 = 5 N/10 m s-2 = 0.50 kg; and m2 = 5 N/20 m s-2 = 0.25 kg. If the two masses were tied together, the total mass, m would be m = 0.50 kg + 0.25 kg = 0.75 kg. The acceleration, a produced in the combined mass by the 5 N force would be, a = F/m = 5 N/0.75 kg = 6.67 m s-2. Example 9.5 The velocity-time graph of a ball of mass 20 g moving along a straight line on a long table is given in Fig. 9.9.
 Solution: The initial velocity of the motorcar u = 108 km/h = 108 × 1000 m/(60 × 60 s) = 30 m s-1 and the final velocity of the motorcar v = 0 m s-1. The total mass of the motorcar along with its passengers = 1000 kg and the time taken to stop the motorcar, t = 4 s. From Eq. (9.5) we have the magnitude of the force (F) applied by the brakes as m(v – u)/t. On substituting the values, we get F = 1000 kg × (0 – 30) m s-1/4 s = – 7500 kg m s-2 or – 7500 N. The negative sign tells us that the force exerted by the brakes is opposite to the direction of motion of the motorcar. Example 9.4 A force of 5 N gives a mass m1, an acceleration of 10 m s–2 and a mass m2, an acceleration of 20 m s-2. What acceleration would it give if both the masses were tied together? FORCE
 Solution: The initial velocity of the motorcar u = 108 km/h = 108 × 1000 m/(60 × 60 s) = 30 m s-1 and the final velocity of the motorcar v = 0 m s-1. The total mass of the motorcar along with its passengers = 1000 kg and the time taken to stop the motorcar, t = 4 s. From Eq.

This is because each force acts on a different object that may have a different mass. When a gun is fired, it exerts a forward force on the bullet. The bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun. This results in the recoil of the gun (Fig. 9.11). Since the gun has a much greater mass than the bullet, the acceleration of the gun is much less than the acceleration of the bullet.

Fig 8.9 (a) shows the path of an athlete along a rectangular track ABCD. Let us assume that the athlete runs at a uniform speed on the straight parts AB, BC, CD and DA of the track. In order to keep himself on track, he quickly changes his speed at the corners. How many times will the athlete have to change his direction of motion, while he completes one round? It is clear that to move in a rectangular track once, he has to change his direction of motion four times. Now, suppose instead of a rectangular track, the athlete is running along a hexagonal shaped path ABCDEF, as shown in Fig. 8.9(b). In this situation, the athlete will have to change his direction six times while he completes one round. What if the track was not a hexagon but a regular octagon, with eight equal sides as shown by ABCDEFGH in Fig. 8.9(c)? It is observed that as the number of sides of the track increases the athelete has to take turns more and more often. What would happen to the shape of the track as we go on increasing the number of sides indefinitely? If you do this you will notice that the shape of the track approaches the shape of a circle and the length of each of the sides will decrease to a point. If the athlete moves with a velocity of constant magnitude along the circular path, the only change in his velocity is due to the change in the direction of motion. The motion of the athlete moving along a circular path is, therefore, an example of an accelerated motion. We know that the circumference of a circle of radius r is given by 2 πr . If the athlete takes t seconds to go once around the circular path of radius r, the speed v is given by v=

What do you understand from the signboard in Fig. 8.2(b)? Different objects may take different amounts of time to cover a given distance. Some of them move fast and some move slowly. The rate at which objects move can be different. Also, different objects can move at the same rate. One of the ways of measuring the rate of motion of an object is to find out the distance travelled by the object in unit time. This quantity is referred to as speed. The SI unit of speed is metre per second. This is represented by the symbol m s–1 or m/s. The other units of speed include centimetre per second (cm s–1) and kilometre per hour (km h–1). To specify the speed of an object, we require only its magnitude. The speed of an object need not be constant. In most cases, objects will be in non-uniform motion. Therefore, we describe the rate of motion of such objects in terms of their average speed. The average speed of an object is obtained by dividing the total distance travelled by the total time taken. That is, average speed =
 Total distance travelled Total time taken
 If an object travels a distance s in time t then its speed v is, v=
 In the second case: initial velocity, u = 6 m s–1; final velocity, v = 4 m s–1; time, t = 5 s.

A cell having equal water concentration to its surrounding medium will not show any changes.  Cell wall is composed of cellulose and cell membrane is composed of lipids and proteins.,"osmosis. The movement of water across the plasma membrane is also affected by the amount of substance dissolved in water. Thus, osmosis is the net diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane toward a higher solute concentration. What will happen if we put an animal cell or a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt in water? One of the following three things could happen: 1. If the medium surrounding the cell has a higher water concentration than the cell, meaning that the outside solution is very dilute, the cell will gain water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypotonic solution. Water molecules are free to pass across the cell membrane in both directions, but more water will come into the cell than will leave. The net (overall) result is that water enters the cell. The cell is likely to swell up. 2. If the medium has exactly the same water concentration as the cell, there will be no net movement of water across the cell membrane. Such a solution is known as an isotonic solution. Water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but the amount going in is the same as the amount going out, so there is no overall movement of water. The cell will stay the same size. 3. If the medium has a lower concentration of water than the cell, meaning that it is a very concentrated solution, the cell will lose water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypertonic solution. Again, water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but this time more water leaves the cell than enters it. Therefore the cell will shrink. Thus, osmosis is a special case of diffusion through a selectively permeable membrane. Now let us try out the following activity: 60

" Explain the terms :  Endocytosis,  Plasmolysis.  What will happen if the organisation of a cell is damaged due to certain physical or chemical reasons ? 5 Marks each  How do substances like CO2 and water move in and out of the cell ? ","  	 Endocytosis : The flexibility of the cell membrane enables the cell to engulf food and other materials from its external environment. Such process is known as endocytosis.  Plasmolysis : When a living plant cell loses water through osmosis, there is shrinkage or contraction of the contents of the cell away from the cell wall. This phenomenon is known as plasmolysis.  When the organisation of a cell gets damaged, lysosomes will burst and their enzymes will eat up their own cell organelles. Therefore, lysosomes are also known as the suicidal bags of the cell.  Gases like CO2 and O2 move in and out of the cell by diffusion from their higher concentration to lower concentration. Water enters the cell by endosmosis through semi-permeable plasma membrane from its higher concentration to lower concentration. Similarly, water moves out of the cell by exosmosis when a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution.","Unicellular freshwater organisms and most plant cells tend to gain water through osmosis. Absorption of water by plant roots is also an example of osmosis. Thus, diffusion is important in exhange of gases and water in the life of a cell. In additions to this, the cell also obtains nutrition from its environment. Different molecules move in and out of the cell through a type of transport requiring use of energy. The plasma membrane is flexible and is made up of organic molecules called lipids and proteins. However, we can observe the structure of the plasma membrane only through an electron microscope. The flexibility of the cell membrane also enables the cell to engulf in food and other material from its external environment. Such processes are known as endocytosis. Amoeba acquires its food through such processes. SCIENCE

Explain why water does not gather in the hollowed out portions of A and D.  Fresh peeled potato cup Sugar Chromosome,"The nucleus has a double layered covering called nuclear membrane. The nuclear membrane has pores which allow the transfer of material from inside the nucleus to its outside, that is, to the cytoplasm (which we will talk about in section 5.2.4). The nucleus contains chromosomes, which are visible as rod-shaped structures only when the cell is about to divide. Chromosomes contain infor mation for inheritance of characters from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid) molecules. Chromosomes are composed of DNA and protein. DNA molecules contain the information necessary for constructing and organising cells. Functional segments of DNA are called genes. In a cell which is not dividing, this DNA is present as part of chromatin material. Chromatin material is visible as entangled mass of thread like structures. Whenever the cell is about to divide, the chromatin material gets organised into chromosomes. The nucleus plays a central role in cellular reproduction, the process by which a single cell divides and forms two new cells. It also plays a crucial part, along with the environment, in determining the way the cell will develop and what form it will exhibit at maturity, by directing the chemical activities of the cell. In some organisms like bacteria, the nuclear region of the cell may be poorly defined due to the absence of a nuclear membrane. Such an undefined nuclear region containing only nucleic acids is called a nucleoid. Such organisms, whose cells lack a nuclear membrane, are called prokaryotes (Pro = primitive or primary; karyote ≈ karyon = nucleus). Organisms with cells having a nuclear membrane are called eukaryotes. Prokaryotic cells (see Fig. 5.4) also lack most of the other cytoplasmic organelles

 What would happen if the plasma membrane ruptures or breaks down ?  What would happen to the life of a cell if there were no Golgi apparatus ? ," Plasma membrane is the selectively permeable membrane that surrounds the cell and allows the entry and exit of selected materials into and out of the cell. If it ruptures, the contents of the cell will come in direct contact with the surrounding medium and not only unwanted material will be able to enter freely into the cell, but useful material will also find its way out of the cell easily. This will seriously disrupt the various metabolic activities of the cell and will result in its eminent death.  If there were no Golgi apparatus, the material synthesized by Endoplasmic reticulum would not be carried to the various parts inside and outside the cell. Also as the Golgi apparatus performs the function of storage and modification of the material synthesized in the cell, these material could not be stored and modified further. Moreover, there will be no production of lysosomes which will cause the accumulation of waste material, viz. worn out and dead cell organelles within the cell which will ultimately lead to cell death.","5.2.5 (ii) GOLGI APPARATUS The Golgi apparatus, first described by Camillo Golgi, consists of a system of membrane-bound vesicles (flattened sacs) arranged approximately parallel to each other in stacks called cisterns. These membranes often have connections with the membranes of ER and therefore constitute another portion of a complex cellular membrane system. The material synthesised near the ER is packaged and dispatched to various targets inside and outside the cell through the Golgi apparatus. Its functions include the storage, modification and packaging of products in vesicles. In some cases, complex sugars may be made from simple sugars in the Golgi apparatus.

"Carry out the following osmosis experiment : Take four peeled potato halves and scoop each one out to make potato cups. One of these potato cups should be made from a boiled potato. Put each potato cup in a trough containing water. Now,  Keep cup A empty.  Put one teaspoon sugar in cup B. Cup A Salt solution Cup B Fresh peeled potato cup Sugar solution Boiled Potato cup Cup C Cup D"," Water gathers in the hollowed portion of B and C because of the process of endosmosis . A potato is made up of several cells, and the cell membranes are selectively permeable. As the cups B and C are filled with sugar and salt respectively and their outer part is in contact with the water, the concentration of water outside the cups is higher than inside the cups, so water moves from its higher concentration towards the lower concentration, i.e., inside the cup.  Potato A acts as a control of the experiment. It is very necessary for comparing the results of the experiment and shows that if the conc. of water is same on both sides, there will be no movement of water.  Water does not gather in the hollowed out portions of A as it does not contain hypertonic solution so there is no concentration difference. Water does not gather in the cup D as the cells of boiled potato are dead and hence no osmosis occurs.","osmosis. The movement of water across the plasma membrane is also affected by the amount of substance dissolved in water. Thus, osmosis is the net diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane toward a higher solute concentration. What will happen if we put an animal cell or a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt in water? One of the following three things could happen: 1. If the medium surrounding the cell has a higher water concentration than the cell, meaning that the outside solution is very dilute, the cell will gain water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypotonic solution. Water molecules are free to pass across the cell membrane in both directions, but more water will come into the cell than will leave. The net (overall) result is that water enters the cell. The cell is likely to swell up. 2. If the medium has exactly the same water concentration as the cell, there will be no net movement of water across the cell membrane. Such a solution is known as an isotonic solution. Water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but the amount going in is the same as the amount going out, so there is no overall movement of water. The cell will stay the same size. 3. If the medium has a lower concentration of water than the cell, meaning that it is a very concentrated solution, the cell will lose water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypertonic solution. Again, water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but this time more water leaves the cell than enters it. Therefore the cell will shrink. Thus, osmosis is a special case of diffusion through a selectively permeable membrane. Now let us try out the following activity: 60
 Take a 100 mL beaker. Fill half the beaker with water and mark the level of water. Dissolve some salt/ sugar with the help of a glass rod. Observe any change in water level. What do you think has happened to the salt? Where does it disappear? Does the level of water change?
 In order to answer these questions we need to use the idea that matter is made up of particles. What was there in the spoon, salt or sugar, has now spread throughout water. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.1.

 “Epidermal cells are protective in nature”. Justify and support your answer with two examples.  Name the structure that receives impulse in neuron.," Epidermis plays a protective role. It protects all the external parts of a plant against loss of water.  In some desert plants, the epidermis has a thick waxy coating of cutin that prevents water loss from the plants.  Epidermal cells on the aerial parts of the plant secrete a waxy, water resistant layer, on the outer surface that helps in protection against loss of water and mechanical injury.  Dendrite receives impulses in neuron.","What you observe is the outermost layer of cells, called epidermis. The epidermis is usually made of a single layer of cells. In some plants living in very dry habitats, the epidermis may be thicker since protection against water loss is critical. The entire surface of a plant has an outer covering epidermis. It protects all the parts of the plant. Epidermal cells on the aerial
 parts of the plant often secrete a waxy, waterresistant layer on their outer surface. This aids in protection against loss of water, mechanical injury and invasion by parasitic fungi. Since it has a protective role to play, cells of epidermal tissue form a continuous layer without intercellular spaces. Most epidermal cells are relatively flat. Often their outer and side walls are thicker than the inner wall. We can observe small pores here and there in the epidermis of the leaf. These pores are called stomata (Fig. 6.5). Stomata are enclosed by two kidney-shaped cells called guard cells. They are necessary for exchanging gases with the atmosphere. Transpiration (loss of water in the form of water vapour) also takes place through stomata. 71
 Recall which gas is required for photosynthesis. Find out the role of transpiration in plants. Epidermal cells of the roots, whose function is water absorption, commonly bear long hairlike parts that greatly increase the total absorptive surface area. In some plants like desert plants, epidermis has a thick waxy coating of cutin (chemical substance with waterproof quality) on its outer surface. Can we think of a reason for this? Is the outer layer of a branch of a tree different from the outer layer of a young stem? As plants grow older, the outer protective tissue undergoes certain changes. A strip of secondary meristem located in the cortex forms layers of cells which constitute the cork. Cells of cork are dead and compactly arranged without intercellular spaces (Fig. 6.6). They also have a substance called suberin in their walls that makes them impervious to gases and water. Cork cells

In unicellular organisms, a single cell performs all basic functions. For example, in Amoeba, a single cell carries out movement, intake of food, gaseous exchange and excretion. But in multicellular organisms there are millions of cells. Most of these cells are specialised to carry out specific functions. Each specialised function is taken up by a different group of cells. Since these cells carry out only a particular function, they do it very efficiently. In human beings, muscle cells contract and relax to cause movement, nerve cells carry messages, blood flows to transport oxygen, food, hormones and waste material and so on. In plants, vascular tissues conduct food and water from one part of the plant to other parts. So, multi-cellular organisms show division of labour. Cells specialising in one function are often grouped together in the body. This means that a particular function is carried out by a cluster of cells at a definite place in the body. This cluster of cells, called a tissue, is arranged and designed so as to give the highest possible efficiency of function. Blood, phloem and muscle are all examples of tissues. A group of cells that are similar in structure and/or work together to achieve a particular function forms a tissue.

 of skin). Simple squamous epithelial cells are extremely thin and flat and form a delicate lining. The oesophagus and the lining of the mouth are also covered with squamous epithelium. The skin, which protects the body, is also made of squamous epithelium. Skin epithelial cells are arranged in many layers to prevent wear and tear. Since they are arranged in a pattern of layers, the epithelium is called stratified squamous epithelium. Where absorption and secretion occur, as in the inner lining of the intestine, tall epithelial cells are present. This columnar (meaning ‘pillar-like’) epithelium facilitates movement across the epithelial barrier. In the respiratory tract, the columnar epithelial tissue also has cilia, which are hair-like projections on the outer surfaces of epithelial cells. These cilia can move, and their movement pushes the mucus forward to clear it. This type of epithelium is thus ciliated columnar epithelium. Cuboidal epithelium (with cube-shaped cells) forms the lining of kidney tubules and ducts of salivary glands, where it provides mechanical support. Epithelial cells often acquire additional specialisation as gland cells, which can secrete substances at the epithelial surface. Sometimes a portion of the epithelial tissue folds inward, and a multicellular gland is formed. This is glandular epithelium.

Under the microscope, these muscles show alternate light and dark bands or striations when stained appropriately. As a result, they are also called striated muscles. The cells of this tissue are long, cylindrical, unbranched and multinucleate (having many nuclei). The movement of food in the alimentary canal or the contraction and relaxation of blood vessels are involuntary movements. We cannot really start them or stop them simply by wanting to do so! Smooth muscles [Fig. 6.11(b)] or involuntary muscles control such movements. They are also found in the iris of the eye, in ureters and in the bronchi of the lungs. The cells are long with pointed ends (spindle-shaped) and uninucleate (having a single nucleus). They are also called unstriated muscles – why would they be called that? The muscles of the heart show rhythmic contraction and relaxation throughout life. These involuntary muscles are called cardiac muscles [Fig. 6.11(c)]. Heart muscle cells are cylindrical, branched and uninucleate.

What is meant by ‘inertia’ ? What are different types of inertia ? Give two examples in each case. ,"Inability of the body to change by itself its state of rest or state of uniform motion is called inertia. Types : Inertia of rest : e.g. :  When a card is flicked with a finger the coin placed over it falls in the tumbler.  Only the carom coin at the bottom of a pile is removed when a fast moving carom striker hits it. Inertia of motion : e.g. :  When a moving bus stops suddenly, the luggage might slide towards the front side of the bus and fall.  We tend to fall forward when a bus suddenly stops. ","9.3 Inertia and Mass All the examples and activities given so far illustrate that there is a resistance offered by an object to change its state of motion. If it is at rest it tends to remain at rest; if it is moving it tends to keep moving. This property of an object is called its inertia. Do all bodies have the same inertia? We know that it is easier to push an empty box than a box full of books. Similarly, if we kick a football it flies away. But if we kick a stone of the same size with equal force, it hardly moves. We may, in fact, get an injury in our foot while doing so! Similarly, in activity 9.2, instead of a

In doing so, the large momentum of fast moving hand is reduced to zero in a very short time. This exerts a very large force on the pile of tiles which is sufficient to break them. ","stick together. What will be the velocity of the combined object after collision? According to the third law of motion when we push on an object, the object pushes back on us with an equal and opposite force. If the object is a massive truck parked along the roadside, it will probably not move. A student justifies this by answering that the two opposite and equal forces cancel each other. Comment on this logic and explain why the truck does not move. A hockey ball of mass 200 g travelling at 10 m s–1 is struck by a hockey stick so as to return it along its original path with a velocity at 5 m s–1. Calculate the magnitude of change of momentum occurred in the motion of the hockey ball by the force applied by the hockey stick. A bullet of mass 10 g travelling horizontally with a velocity of 150 m s–1 strikes a stationary wooden block and comes to rest in 0.03 s. Calculate the distance of penetration of the bullet into the block. Also calculate the magnitude of the force exerted by the wooden block on the bullet. An object of mass 1 kg travelling in a straight line with a velocity of 10 m s–1 collides with, and sticks to, a stationary wooden block of mass 5 kg. Then they both move off together in the same straight line. Calculate the total momentum just before the impact and just after the impact. Also, calculate the velocity of the combined object. An object of mass 100 kg is accelerated uniformly from a velocity of 5 m s–1 to 8 m s–1 in 6 s. Calculate the initial and final momentum of the object. Also, find the magnitude of the force exerted on the object. Akhtar, Kiran and Rahul were riding in a motorcar that was moving with a high velocity on an expressway when an insect hit the windshield and got stuck on the windscreen. Akhtar and Kiran started pondering over the situation. Kiran suggested that the insect suffered a greater change in momentum as compared to the change in momentum of the motorcar (because the change in the velocity of the insect was much more than that of the motorcar). Akhtar said that since the motorcar was moving with a larger velocity, it exerted a larger force on the insect. And as a result the insect died. Rahul while putting an entirely new explanation said that both the motorcar and the insect experienced the same force and a change in their momentum. Comment on these suggestions. How much momentum will a dumb-bell of mass 10 kg transfer to the floor if it falls from a height of 80 cm? Take its downward acceleration to be 10 m s–2.

Air from inside the balloon escapes from the mouth of the balloon. 			Balloon moves in opposite direction that is from left to right. 		 Forces of action and reaction are equal and opposite. ","9.5 Third Law of Motion The first two laws of motion tell us how an applied force changes the motion and provide us with a method of determining the force. The third law of motion states that when one object exerts a force on another object, the second object instantaneously exerts a force back on the first. These two forces are always equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. These forces act on different objects and never on the same object. In the game of football sometimes we, while looking at the football and trying to kick it with a greater force, collide with a player of the opposite team. Both feel hurt because each applies a force to the other. In other words, there is a pair of forces and not just one force. The two opposing forces are also known as action and reaction forces. Let us consider two spring balances connected together as shown in Fig. 9.10. The fixed end of balance B is attached with a rigid support, like a wall. When a force is applied through the free end of spring balance A, it is observed that both the spring balances show the same readings on their scales. It means that the force exerted by spring balance A on balance B is equal but opposite in direction to the force exerted by the balance B on balance A. Any of these two forces can be called as action and the other as reaction. This gives us an alternative statement of the third law of motion i.e., to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. However, it must be remembered that the action and reaction always act on two different objects, simultaneously.

 They differ in odour and inflammability. We know that oil burns in air whereas water extinguishes fire. It is this chemical property of oil that makes it different from water. Burning is a chemical change. During this process one substance reacts with another to undergo a change in chemical composition. Chemical change brings change in the chemical properties of matter and we get new substances. A chemical change is also called a chemical reaction.

" Explain with the help of an activity which shows that particles of matter are very small.  Define matter. Name the states of matter in which the forces between the constituent particles are :  strongest,  weakest.  When sugar and common salt are kept in different jars, they take the shape of the jars. Are they solid ? Justify your answer. ","  Take 2-3 crystals of copper sulphate and dissolve in 100 ml of water.  Take out approximate 10 ml of this solution and put it into 90 ml of clear water.  Take out 10 ml of this solution and put it into another 90 ml of clear water.  Keep diluting for 5-8 times. Inference : A crystal of copper sulphate contains millions of tiny particles which keeps on dividing into smaller and smaller numbers with each dilution.  Anything which possesses mass and occupies space is called matter.  Solid – strongest,  Gas – weakest.  The shape of each individual sugar or salt crystal remains fixed. Therefore, they are solids. ","Take some (approximately 5 g) impure sample of copper sulphate in a china dish. Dissolve it in minimum amount of water. Filter the impurities out. Evaporate water from the copper sulphate solution so as to get a saturated solution. Cover the solution with a filter paper and leave it undisturbed at room temperature to cool slowly for a day. You will obtain the crystals of copper sulphate in the china dish. This process is called crystallisation.

" Describe an activity to show that the particles of matter are continuously moving using red ink, honey and water in beakers. What is the effect of increase of temperature on the movement of particles ? Give reason.  Why is oxygen called a gas ? Give two reasons. "," Take two beakers filled with water, put a drop of red ink in one beaker and honey in the second beaker and leave them undisturbed. After sometime it can be observed that the colour of the ink spreads evenly throughout the water and also the honey in the second beaker. This happens because the molecules continuously keep on moving. When temperature is increased, the movement of particles become faster. This is due to increase in their kinetic energy.   Oxygen has neither fixed volume nor fixed shape.  Oxygen exerts pressure due to collision of the molecules on the walls of containing vessel and among themselves.","Particles of matter are continuously moving, that is, they possess what we call the kinetic energy. As the temperature rises, particles move faster. So, we can say that with increase in temperature the kinetic energy of the particles also increases. In the above three activities we observe that particles of matter intermix on their own with each other. They do so by getting into the spaces between the particles. This intermixing of particles of two different types of matter on their own is called diffusion. We also observe that on heating, diffusion becomes faster. Why does this happen?
