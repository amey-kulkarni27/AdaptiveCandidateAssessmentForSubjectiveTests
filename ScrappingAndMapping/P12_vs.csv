He suggested the philosophy of ‘peaceful co-existence’ while trying to improve relations with the West during the Cold War. ‘Limited Test Ban Treaty’ was introduced in his period. He suppressed popular rebellion in Hungary and involved in Cuban Missile Crises. It was due to the wise decision of Khruschev and Kennedy that world was saved from the Third World War during Cuban Missile Crises.","‘perestroika’(restructuring) and glasnost (openness).

Soviet system became very bureaucratic making life very difficult for its citizens. 2. Communist party of Soviet Union had a tight control over all institutions and was unaccountable to the people. The party bureaucrats gained more privilege than ordinary citizens, which increased in satisfaction among common citizens. 3. Lack of democracy and the absence of freedom of speech stifled people, who often expressed their dissent in jokes and cartoons. 4. The party refused to recognized the urge of people in the fifteen different republic that formed the Soviet union to manage their own affairs including their cultural affairs.

But in reality, Russia dominated everything and people from other regions felt neglected and often suppressed. 5. In the arms race, the Soviet Union managed to match the US from time to time, but at great cost. The Soviet Union lagged behind the west in technology, infrastructure (e.g., transport, power) and most importantly, in fulfilling the political or economic aspirations of citizens. 6. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 weakened the system even further. Though wages continued to grow, productivity and technology fell considerably behind that of the West. This led to the shortages in all consumer goods. Food imports increased every year. Q.6. Explain process of disintegration of Soviet Union during the period of Mikhail Gorbachev.
 Ans. Mikhail Gorbachev became president of Soviet Union in 1985. Reforms were necessary to keep the USSR abreast of the information and technological revolutions taking place in West. To resolve this situation, he introduced reform policies of ‘perestroika’ (restructuring) and ‘glasnost’ (openness); However Gorbachev’s decision to normaliserelations with the West and democratise and reforms the Soviet Union had some other effects that neither he nor anyone else intended or anticipated. The people in the East European countries, which were earlier the part of the Soviet bloc started to protest against their own governments and Soviet control. Unlike in the past, the Soviet Union, under Gorbachev, did not intervene when the disturbances occurred and the communist regimes collapsed one after another. These developments were accompanied by a rapidly escalating crisis within the USSR that hastened its disintegration. Gorbachev initiated the policies of economic and political reform and democratisation within the country. The reforms were opposed by leaders within the communist party. This increased the speed of disintegration of Soviet Union. The effect of ‘Glasnost’ (openness) policy first took place in Lithuania. Movement for the freedom from USSR began. Soon it spread to Estonia and Latvia. But Gorbachev took the favour of Glasnost instead resolving the matter. In October 1989, he declared that Warsaw pact members were free to decide their own future. In the next month, November 1989, citizens of Germany toppled the Berlin Wall. In February 1990, elections held at Soviet Parliament (Duma). Gorbachev stripped the Soviet Communist Party of its 72 years old monopoly owned power by calling on the Soviet Parliament (Duma) to permit multiparty politics. It had surprising consequences. The communist party which ruled for last 72 years lost the elections. Lithunia declared its independence in March 1990. Russian Parliament declared its independence from Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin played an important role in this process. This was the most deepest indication of disintegration of Soviet Union. The public revolt that occurred to remove of communist party in all the republics of Soviet Union after falling of Berlin Wall in 1989 was so powerful that it wasn’t possible to resolve it with the help of military force. In December 1991, under the leadership of Yeltsin, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, three major republics of the USSR, declared that the Soviet Union was disbanded. And in this way, Soviet Union was disintegrated. Q.7. Explain how did the Cuban Missile Crisis drive the world on the brink of a nuclear war? [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. (i) In April 1961, the USSR was worried that USA would attack Cuba and overthrow the government of Fidel Castro. Therefore, the leaders of Cuba decided to convert the country into a Russian base. (ii) Consequently, the USSR placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. This strategic move put the USA for the first time, under the fire from close range.

It brought ruin to the economies and disaster upon the people of the entire region. 2. Due to it, large state – controlled industrial complex almost collapsed, as about 90% of its industries were put up for sale to private individuals and companies. 3.

Russia supported India during the Kargil War. 2. Russia supplied raw material to India for the development of energy sector. Q.14. Analyse Soviet Union’s situation after the Second World War. Ans. After the Second World War, Soviet Union became a great power. Soviet Union progressed in every field. The Soviet economy was then more developed than the rest of the world. Vast mineral and energy resources helped it in its economical development and progress. There was an improvement in the efficiency of transport sector. Eventhe remote areas of USSR were connected with the capital Moscow. It also improved much in scientific sector. It was successful in sending first space traveller to Moon. It was a leading country in terms of production of nuclear weapons. Everyone in Soviet Union had consumer goods, though their quality did not match that of the Western Capitalist countries. Yet basic necessities including health, education, childcare were available to all. There was no unemployment. All citizens were ensured of minimum living standards. Q.15. Why were people dissatisfied with Soviet System? Ans. Soviet system was based on the ideology but after the Second World War, there was an internal dissatisfaction which erupted like fire. The economic, social and political lives of Soviet citizens were under the state control, due to which bureaucracy increased, making life very difficult for its citizens. The Soviet political system centered around communist party. Thus, no proper system of democracy and freedom of speech was there. The party bureaucrats gained more privileges than ordinary citizens, which increased dissatisfaction among the people. The bureaucrats and authoritarians were not answerable to common people. There was a discrimination among the citizens of Russian republics and citizens of other republics due to which the citizens of other republics felt neglected and often suppressed. Q.16. Which step of Soviet Union in the period of Brezhnev led to its disintegration? Ans. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 weakened the system. Its economy ruined due to this step. Even after hard practice of ten years (1979-89), it couldn’t gain full control over Afghanistan and finally, it had to call back its armies. Invading Soviet Union in Afghanistan resulted in continuous shortage of consumer good and food products. The conditions were so miserable that food imports increased every year and
 it led to the increase in the dissatisfaction and anger amongst people. The Soviet economy was faltering in the late 1970s, became stagnant and finally Soviet Union disintegrated. Q.17. How did Soviet disintegration affect International economy? Ans. After the disintegration of Soviet Union, capitalist system gained more popularity than communist system. America gained benefit from this as it didn’t have to face any kind of problem in the expansion of its capitalist system. America evolved as the only superpower. The people of its opposite alliance were attracted towards its system. Now on the basis of America’s power and reputation, capitalist economy is the dominant economy at international level. Institutions like World Bank and IMF became advisories of different countries as these institutions provided loan to those countries to encourage them to move towards capitalist economy. In this manner, disintegration of Soviet Union had completely changed the International economical system. Q.18. ‘Although India has established good relationships with all the communist countries, yet the relations of India and Russia are most cordial.’ Explain the above statement with any three arguments in favour. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Or Describe the relations of India and early communist countries. Ans. During the Cold War era, India and the USSR enjoyed a special relationship, which led critics to say that India was part of the Soviet Camp. It was a multidimensional relationship. (i) Political: The Soviet Union supported India’s stand on the Kashmir issue in the UN. It also supported India during its major conflicts, especially during the war with Pakistan in 1971. India too supported Soviet foreign policy in some crucial but indirect ways (When US had sent flotillas in Pacific Ocean). (ii) Economic: The Soviet Union assisted India’s public sector companies at a time when such assistance was difficult to get. It gave aid and technical assistance for steel plants like Bhilai, Bokaro, Visakhapatnam and machinery plants like Bharat Heavy Electrical Ltd., etc. The Soviet Union accepted Indian currency for tradewhen India was short of foreign exchange. (iii) Military: India received most of its military hardware from the Soviet Union at a time when few other countries were willing at part with military technologies. The Soviet Union entered into various agreements allowing India to jointly produce military equipments. (iv) Culture: Hindi films and Indian culture were popular in the Soviet Union. A large number of Indian writers and artists visited the USSR. India has maintained good
 relations with all the post – Communist countries. But the strongest relations are still those between Russia and India. India’s relations with Russia and an important aspect of India’s foreign policy. Indo-Russian relations are embedded in a history of trust and common interests and are matched by popular preceptions. Indian heroes from Raj Kapoor to Amitabh Bachchan are household names in Russia and Many post-Soviet countries. One can hear Hindi film songs all over the region, and India is part of popular memory. Russia and India share a vision of a multipolar world order. What they mean by a multipolar world order is the co-existence of several powers in the international system. Collective security greater regionalism, negotiated settlements of international conflicts, an independent foreign policy for all countries and decision making through bodies like the UN that should be strengthened, democratised and empowered. More than 80bilateral agreements have been signed between India and Russia as part of the Indo Russia strategic Agreements of 2001. India stands to benefit from its relationship with Russia on the issues like Kashmir, energy supplies, sharing information on international terrorism, access to Central Asia, and balancing its relations with China. Russia stands to benefit from this relationship because India is the second largest arms market for Russia. The Indian military gets most of its hardware from Russia. Q.19. Write an essay for or against the following proposition. With the disintegration of the Second World, India should change its foreign policy and focus more on friendship with the US rather than with traditional friends like Russia. [NCERT] Ans. The arguments in favour and against the statement are as follows: Arguments in favour: Unipolar system was originated in the World after the disintegration of Soviet Union. USA was the only superpower on international front. The war which continued for so many years between communist and capitalist ideology was finally ended along with the disintegration of Soviet Union. The capitalist system had proved its superiority over communist system. That’s why India needs to change its foreign policies and should lend a hand of friendship towards America. America wants to establish trade relationship with India for its own interest. So, India should be conscious while establishing its trade relationships and should exercise the friendship of superpower of the world to its own interests. Arguments in against: Indo-Soviet relations have always been cordial. Russia had always helped India. Although, India was a non-aligned country, even then Soviet Union provided India with economic and military assistance at the time of Bangladesh crises in 1971. Indo-Soviet relations became deeper after Tashkent treaty to avoid Indo Pak War. Indo-Russian relations were cordial even after disintegration of Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin visited India on 27 January 1993, where he signed an Indo-Russian treaty for military and technical agreement. India stood benefitted from its relationship with Russia on issues like Kashmir. On 23 December 1994, the Russian P.M. visited India and
 relations with all the post – Communist countries. But the strongest relations are still those between Russia and India. India’s relations with Russia and an important aspect of India’s foreign policy. Indo-Russian relations are embedded in a history of trust and common interests and are matched by popular preceptions.

Indo-Soviet relations became deeper after Tashkent treaty to avoid Indo Pak War. Indo-Russian relations were cordial even after disintegration of Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin visited India on 27 January 1993, where he signed an Indo-Russian treaty for military and technical agreement. India stood benefitted from its relationship with Russia on issues like Kashmir. On 23 December 1994, the Russian P.M. visited India and
 agreement was signed between both the countries for military, technology and trade. Russia supported India during Indo-Pak War. On 7 December 1999, a ten-year agreement between India and Russia was signed. According to this, Indo-Russia would collectively produce military and non-military aircrafts. Indian nuclear tests were supported by Russia in 1998. By keeping in mind all the above factors, we reach on a conclusion that India should not be much dependent on America after having Russia, as a trusted friend. The following are the reasons for the above conclusion: 1. America forced Britain to free India but it opposed India when India adopted nonalignment policy after independence. Instead, it supported Pakistan, India’s rival country and started providing military assistance to Pakistan. 2. America doesn’t want India to emerge as a powerful nation. It opposed India’s nuclear tests and forced India to sign Nuclear Treaty CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty). India always stood against America’s dual policy. 3. America also adopts a dual policy on the issue of terrorism. It says India to remain patient on the issue of Pakistan’s terror attacks. On the contrary, it attacked Afghanistan, causing huge devastation when it was under terror attack. 4. Indo-America’s relationship can’t be as cordial as Pak-America relationship. Pakistan has always been a country of America’s alliance and also gained military assistance from America. Q.20. There had always been an apprehension and risk of struggle and tension in most of the former Soviet Republics. Explain with any 3 examples. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Or Explain the struggle and tension in former Soviet Republics. Ans. Bipolarity has collapsed. Second World War didn’t end the struggle and tension in former Soviet Republics. Most of the former Soviet Republics are prone to conflict and many had civil wars and insurgencies. Growing involvement of outside power had complicated the picture. Some examples are as follows:
 Soviet Union provided military assistance and also provided technology. India got MiG16, MiG-32, Helicopter and N-12 and A-N 32 cargo ships from Soviet Union and help to Soviet Union when Soviet Union had to interfere Afghanistan with military force in 1979, India gave its full assistance to Soviet Union. ‘India’s Festival’ was organised in Soviet Union many times. Disintegration of Soviet Union occurred till 1990 and India – Soviet relation turned into India – Russia relationship. In 2010, visit to India by Prime Minister Putin and President Medvedev played an important role in strengthening bilateral relationships between India and Russia. India–America Relationship: There was a reluctance in Indian–American relations from the beginning. America was the country which pressurised Britain to free India but after independence, India decided to remain non-aligned and didn’t get involved in any of the blocs. This wasn’t acceptable to America and this resulted in economical and military support to our opposing & neighbouring country, Pakistan. Nehru’s visit to America improved relations in 1957. When America supported Pakistan in Indo–Pak War, the threads of relationships were loosened again. In 1977, the atomic treaty to supply Urenium for Tarapur Nuclear Centre by America in the period of Janta Party was not followed. India refused President Jimmy Carter to sign ‘Nuclear non-proliferation treaty’. America’s continuous act of providing weapons to Pakistan against India prohibited cordial relations during Indira Gandhi tenure as P.M. But India-America relations improved when Rajiv Gandhi’s became the Prime Minister. It continued to be cordial during the period of Bill Clinton’s tenure as President. When World Trade Centre was attacked in 2001, America could realise India’s pain and both the countries could establish ideological unification against terrorism and Indo-American relationship improved. In November 2011, India’s visit by America’s President Obama provided structural strength to India–America long term strategic relationship. Effect of India’s foreign policies on its interests: As a leaders of NAM, India’s response to ongoing Cold War was two-fold – at one level, it took particular case in staying away from two alliances, second, it raised its voice against the newly decolonised countries becoming part of these alliances. India tried to remove the conflicts between both thealliances and tried to establish world peace. However, it also gave its contribution to newly independent countries. A non-aligned posture also served India’s interest very directly, in at least two ways: (i) Non-alignment allowed India to take international decisions and stances that served its interests rather than the interests of superpowers and their allies. (ii) India was often able to balance one superpower against the other. If India felt ignored or unduly pressurised by one superpower, it could tilt towards the other. Neither alliance system could take India for granted or bully it.

Since, it happened because of public and not because of military incapability, there was no other way in front of USSR than to stay silent and accept disintegration.","Q.3. Explain any six factors that helped in making Soviet Union as a superpower after the Second World War. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. After the Second World War, following factors were responsible to make Soviet Union a superpower: Eastern Europeans were under control of Soviet Union: During the Second World War, east European countries were liberated from fascist forces by Soviet Union. Thus, after the end of the Second World War, all these east European countries came under the control of Soviet Union. System of countries that came under the influence of Soviet Union: After the end of the Second World War, the political, social and economic system of east European countries were moulded under the influence of Soviet Union. Leader of Socialist Countries: USSR emerged as the leader of socialist bloc. The groups of countries which were liberated from fascist forces were known as ‘Second World’. USSR was the new leader of this bloc. The ‘Warsaw Pact’, a military alliance held them together. Complex Communication Network: USSR had a complex network of information and communication. It was the leading country in the scientific field. It was successful in sending first space traveller or moon. It was a leading country in terms of production of nuclear weapons. Improvement in transport sector: Even the remotest areas of USSR were connected with capital Moscow with the improvement in efficiency of transport section, which led to the change in economic and cultural environment. Improvement in other fields such as Industries, Occupation and land system: After the Second World War, USSR improved in every field. There was noticeable improvement in its economy. Vast minerals and energy resources helped in its progress. It had a domestic consumer industry that produced everything from pins to cars. The Soviet state ensured a minimum standard of living for all the citizens. There was no unemployment. All people were involved in the production work. The government
 authorities of communist community was not the same as ordinary people. The party bureaucrats gained more privileges than ordinary citizens which increased disatisfaction among common citizens. Gorbachev implemented policies of ‘Perestroika’ (restructuring) and ‘Glasnost’ (openness). Then the citizens of Soviet Union came to know that Soviet Union lagged behind the West in terms of economic and infrastructure. The citizens lost interest in communist system after becoming aware of this fact. Soviet Union created problems for itself by doing military interference in Afghanistan during the period of Brezhnev. It ruined the economy of Soviet Union and Gorbachev declared that Warsaw Pact members were free to decide their own future. There were serious reactions of citizens of Soviet Union over economic reforms and policies of openness. Their aspirations went so high that they demanded more rights and openness. On the Other hand, members of communist party criticised reforms done by Gorbachev by saying that he was moving too quickly. In this ‘tug of war’, Gorbachev lost support on all sides and divided public opinion. Cooperation within all the republics could not establish even after the rule of a monopolist party for 72 years in Soviet Union. The Russian republics like Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia and Baltic Republics (Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia) always felt that they are not able to develop in the manner in which they should due to MiddleAsian backward union states. A large proportion of their equipments used to spend on these backward republics.
 Q.9. Explain any six consequences of disintegration of Soviet Union. [CBSE Delhi 2012, 2013; (AI) 2014] Ans. (i) End of the Cold War: Disintegration of Soviet Union led to end of the Cold War confrontations. The ideological dispute over, whether the socialist system would beat the capitalist system was not an issue anymore. (ii) End of Massive Arms Race: Cold War with Ideological dispute had engaged the military of two blocs, had triggered a massive arms race and accumulation of nuclear weapons, and had led to the existence of military blocs. The end of the confrontation brought a ray of hope to that there will be an end to this arms race and peace would be established. (iii) Unipolar System: The possibility of disintegration of Soviet Union was expressed as either unipolar international politics with the domination of remaining one superpower on the rapidly changing international stage or European Union, SAARC, ASEAN, etc., could become important players in the international system,thereby bringing in a multipolar system where no one power could dominate. As it turned out, the US became the sole superpower.
 (iv) Emergence of New Countries: The end of the soviet bloc meant the emergence of many new countries. All these countries had their own independent aspirations and choices. Some of them, especially the Baltic and East European states wanted to join the European Union and became a part of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation (NATO). The Central Asian Countries wanted to take advantage of their geographical location and continue their close ties with Russia and also to establish ties with the West, the US, China and other. Thus, the international stage showed many new players emerge, each with its own identity, interest and economic and political difficulties. (v) Supremacy of Capitalist Ideology: This was already proved after the disintegration of Soviet Union and conflict between Capitalist and communist ideology was over. India learnt a lesson and released its faith in the mixed economy in 1991. India started following liberal and global policies. Institutions like World Bank and International Monetary Fund were considered as country’s prime counsellor. (vi) Emergence of Single Superpower: India had successfully maintained its relationwith America and Soviet Union under the policy of non-alignment. Such stand supported India after the disintegration of Soviet Union and it started improving its relation with the United States. The US also welcomed India’s efforts. Q.10. If the Soviet Union had not disintegrated and the world had remained bipolar, how would that situation had affected the world politics? [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. If the Soviet Union had not disintegrated, it would definitely had affected the following developments. (i) Cold War confrontations would not have ended and USA would not have become the only superpower of the World. (ii) Most of the countries which were part of erstwhile USSR would have never got the independence. (iii) Accumulation of nuclear weapons would have continued endlessly.

[CBSE (AI) 2014],"In the traditional conception of the security, the greatest danger to a country is from military threats. The source of this danger is another country, which by threatening military action endangers the core value of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.","[CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. 1. In the traditional conception of security, the greatest danger to a country is from military threats. The source of this danger is another country which by threatening military action endangers the core values of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. 2. Military action also endangers the lives of ordinary citizens. Q.10. What is the viewpoint of world towards war under traditional concept of security? Ans. It is now an almost universally accepted view that countries should only go to war for the right reasons, primarily self-defence or to protect other people from genocide. War must also be limited in terms of the means that are used. Armies must avoid killing or hurting non-combatants as well as unarmed and surrendering combatants. They should not be excessively violent. Force must in any case be used only after all the alternatives have failed. Q.11. What is meant by non-traditional notion of security? Differentiate between the narrow and the broad concept of human security. [CBSE (AI) 2016] Ans. Non-traditional notion of security are non-military threats such human security, climate change, environmental security, economic security, pandemics, social issues, etc. Human security is the combination of threats associated with war, genocide, and the displacement of populations. Human security in simple terms means freedom fromwant and ‘freedom from fear’. The narrow concept of human security includes security from violence that’s occurs from wars and armed conflicts. The broader concept of human security includes safety from economic, pandemic, environmental and social conflicts and unrests. Kofi Annan puts it as the protection of communities and individuals from internal violence. Q.12. What is the difference between traditional and non-traditional security? Which category would the creation and sustenance of alliances belong to? [NCERT] Or What are the differences between policies traditional and non-traditional security? [CBSE Delhi 2014, 2015] Ans. There are two policies of security: 1. Traditional policy 2. Non-traditional policy.
 Following are the differences between them: Traditional policy 1. There are more changes of military attack. 2. Ordinary men and women are madetargets of war along with the soldiers. 3. Only military comes under threat. 4. It is concerned with preventingwar, balance of power and formingalliances.
 Non-traditional policy 1. Non-traditional notions of securitygo beyond military threats to includea wide range of threats and dangersaffecting the conditions of humanexistence. 2. Whole human existence comesunder threat. 3. Threat involves epidemic, famineand natural calamity. 4. Countries are expected to increasemutual cooperation.

Whole human existence comesunder threat. 3. Threat involves epidemic, famineand natural calamity. 4. Countries are expected to increasemutual cooperation.
 Alliance building comes under traditional security. Many countries are involved in an alliance. They take steps in the direction of preventing war or defend against military attack. It aims at national interests. Q.13. What are the choices available to a state when its security is threatened, according to traditional security perspective? [NCERT] Ans. In the traditional conception of security, the greatest danger to a country is from military threats. The source of this danger is another country which by threatening military action endangers the core values of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. Agriculture, trade, business and industries of the region of war are affected adversely. Quite often, ordinary women and men are made targets of war to break their support to the war. In responding to the threat of a war, a government has three basic choices: 1. To surrender 2. To prevent the other side from attacking by promising to raise the costs of war to an unacceptable level; 3. To defend itself when war actually breaks out so as to deny the attacking country its objectives. Q.14. Distinguish between the internal and external notion of traditional security. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Internal notion of traditional security: (i) Internal military conflicts.

How is balance of power a key component of traditional security policy? [CBSE (AI) 2012],"Balance of power is a key component of traditional security policy. When countries look around them, they see that some countries are bigger and stronger. This is a clue to who might be a threat in the future. That is why, government of one country is concerned with maintaining a balance of the power with the government of another country.","Q.1. What is ‘Balance of Power’? How could a state achieve this? [NCERT] Ans. ‘Balance of Power’ is a component of traditional security policy—It is a widely accepted fact that countries of world never had same geography, population, financial resources, military, etc. So, balance of power is integral in states. When small countries look around them, they see that some countries are bigger and stronger. This is a clue to who might be a threat in the future. For instance, a neighbouring country may not say it is preparing for attack. There may be no obvious reason for attack. But the fact that this country is very powerful is a sign that some point in the future, it may choose to be aggressive. Governments are, therefore, very sensitive to the balance of power between their country and other countries. They do work hard to maintain a favourable balance of power with other countries, especially those close by, those with whom they have differences, or with those they have had conflicts in the past. A good part of maintaining a balance of power is to build up one’s military power, although economic and technological power are also important as they are the bases for military power. Q.2. What are the objectives of military alliances? Give an example of a functioning military, alliance with its specific objectives. [NCERT] Ans. An alliance is a coalition of states that coordinate their actions to deter or defend against military attack. Most alliances are formalised in written treaties and are based on a fairly clear identification of who constitutes the threat. Countries form alliances to increase the effective power relative to another country or alliance. NATO is a powerful organisation, which is still into existence. It aims at maintaining military security of American and West European countries that came under the leadership of USA. It also aims at maintaining military, cultural and economic dominance on western countries. Q.3. What are the four elements of security? Give an example of each. [CBSE Sample Paper] Ans. There are the four elements of security: 1. Deterrence: The condition where war is tried to be prevented, like nuclear power acted as a deterrent between both the super powers during the Cold War. 2. Military Power: To raise military power to limit or prevent the war and to face external power.
 3. Balance of power: Every country works hard to maintain a favourable balance of power, especially in military. For example, purchasing weapons from foreign countries for modernisation of military by India and Pakistan. 4. To form alliances: Some countries form an alliance to increase their military power and coordinate their actions to deter or defend against military attack done on any of the country. For example, ‘NATO’ and ‘Warsaw Pact’ were established by America and USSR respectively. Q.4. Explain the process of confidence building under traditional security conception. Ans. Traditional security also accepts confidence building as a means of avoiding violence. Confidence building is a process in which countries share their thoughts and information with their rivals. They tell each other about their military intentions and, up to a point, their military plans. This is a way to show that they are not planning a surprise attack. They also tell each other about the kind of forces they possess, and they may share information on where those forces are deployed. In short, confidence building is a process designed to ensure that rivals do not go to war through misunderstanding or misperception. Q.5. Explain the importance of cooperation in the field of ‘Traditional Security.’ [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. The importance of cooperation in the field of ‘Traditional Security’ is disarmament, arms control, and confidence building. Disarmament requires all states to give up certain kinds of weapons. For example, the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and 1992 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) banned the production and possession of these weapons. Arms control regulates the acquisition or development of weapons. The AntiBallistic Missile (ABM) Treaty 1972 tried to stop the United States and the Soviet Union from using ballistic missiles as a defensive shield to launch a nuclear attack. Confidence Building is accepted as a means of avoiding violence. It is a process in which countries share ideas and information with their rivals. Q.6. What is disarmament? Ans. Disarmament literally means ‘not keeping arms’. But no country can safeguard its boundaries without its military capability. So, disarmament refers to limit traditional weapons within a boundary by preventing nuclear weapons. The competition of weapons among countries have caused a global threat to international peace. The need of the hour is to end this competition and establish international peace. Q.7. What are the reasons behind increase in terrorism at international level?

Mention any two components of security policy of India. ,"Following are the two components of security policy of India: 1. To secure the entire country and to maintain unity in the country. 2. Not to compromise that might affect sovereignty, dignity and economic interests of the country.","Ans. Human Security means the protection of the people more than the protection of states. The proponents of human security argue that the primary aim of the state is the protection of its individuals. According to them the concept of human security should include hunger, diseases and natural disasters as they kill even more people than war.Thus, human security should protect people from these threats as well as from violence and war. In its broadest formulation, the human security agenda also encompasses economic security and ‘threats to human dignity’. Q.12. Explain four components of India’s security strategy. [CBSE Delhi, (AI) 2014] Ans. India’s security strategy has four broad components, which have been used in a varying combinations from time to time. 1. Strengthening Military Capabilities: India has been involved in conflicts with its neighbour—Pakistan in 1947-48, 1965, 1971 and 1999; and China in 1962. Since it is surrounded by nuclear-armed countries in the South Asian Region, India’s decision to conduct nuclear test in 1998 was justified by the Indian government in terms of safeguarding national security. India first tested a nuclear device in 1974. 2. Strengthen International Norms: India’s security strategy has been to strengthen international norms and international institutions to protect its security interests. India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru supported the cause of Asian solidarity, decolonisation, disarmament and the UN as a forum in which international conflicts could be settled. Most importantly it used non-alignment to help carve out an area of peace outside the bloc politics of the two superpowers. India joined 160 countries that have signed and ratified the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which provides a road map for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases to check global warming. Indian troops have been sent abroad on UN peacekeeping missions in support of cooperative security initiatives. 3. Internal Security: The third component of Indian security strategy is geared towards meeting security challenges within the country. Several militant groups from areas such as Nagaland, Mizoram, Punjab and Kashmir among others have, from time to time sought to break away from India. India has tried to preserve national unity by adopting a democratic political system, which allows different communities and groups of people to freely articulate their grievances and share political power. 4. Economic Growth: There has been an attempt in India to develop its economy in a way that the vast mass of citizens are lifted out of poverty and misery and huge economic inequalities are not allowed to exist. The attempt has not quite succeeded; we are still a very poor and unequal country. Yet democratic politics allows spaces for articulating the voice of the poor and the deprived citizens. There is a pressure on the democratically elected governments to combine economic growth with human
 "
What is meant by war? Does war provide security to people?,"War means bloodshed and huge destruction. War does not provide security to people. It rather causes death, orphans, diseases, widows and destruction.","[CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. 1. In the traditional conception of security, the greatest danger to a country is from military threats. The source of this danger is another country which by threatening military action endangers the core values of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. 2. Military action also endangers the lives of ordinary citizens. Q.10. What is the viewpoint of world towards war under traditional concept of security? Ans. It is now an almost universally accepted view that countries should only go to war for the right reasons, primarily self-defence or to protect other people from genocide. War must also be limited in terms of the means that are used. Armies must avoid killing or hurting non-combatants as well as unarmed and surrendering combatants.

To defend itself when war actually breaks out so as to deny the attacking country its objectives. Q.14. Distinguish between the internal and external notion of traditional security. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Internal notion of traditional security: (i) Internal military conflicts.
 (ii) Separatist movements: Internally, these states feared threats from separatist movements which wanted to form independent states. Sometimes, both external and internal threats submerged. This was because a neighbour might aid and abet internal separatist movements leading to tension between the two neighbouring states. (iii) Internal wars: Internal wars now account for more than 95% of the armed conflicts all over the world. There has been a steep rise twelve times in the number of civil wars, between 1946 and 1991 the highest jump in over 200 years. External notion of traditional security: (i) Danger to a country from military threats The source of such a security threat emerges from another country which, through its military action, threatens the core values of sovereignity, independence and territorial integrity. Military action even endangers the life of ordinary residents of a country. In a war, it is highly unlikely that only soldiers would die or be hurt. In all the likelihood, men and women, who are ordinary citizens and soft targets are made victims in a war, to break their support for the war. (ii) Deterrence, defence and balance of power Governments may even make the choice of surrender when actually in a war, but this may not be promoted as a country’s defence policy. Security policy, is hence, concerned with preventing war, which is known as deterrence, and with limiting or ending war, which is called defence. (iii) Alliance building as components of traditional security An alliance is a coalition of countries to deter or defend themselves unitedly against any possible military attack. Most alliances are formal written treaties based on a clear identification of potential threatening countries. Countries form military alliances to revitalise their effective power strength against other possible military alliance threats. (Any two points) Q.15. Nuclear weapons as deterrence or defence have limited usage against contemporary security threats to states. Explain the statement. [NCERT] Ans. Non-traditional notions of security go beyond military threats to include a wide range of threats and dangers affecting the conditions of human existence. These threats are poverty, epidemic, global warming, etc. Military attack causes threat not only the country but also affects whole human existence. Hunger, disease and natural disasters kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined. When war was considered as the greatest threat condition to the security, it occurred due to nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are of no use in front of these threats at present. They cannot contribute in any way to solve them. Q.16. Rapid environmental degradation is causing a serious threat to security. Do you agree with the statement? Substantiate your arguments.

When war was considered as the greatest threat condition to the security, it occurred due to nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are of no use in front of these threats at present. They cannot contribute in any way to solve them. Q.16. Rapid environmental degradation is causing a serious threat to security. Do you agree with the statement? Substantiate your arguments.
 "
What do you mean by non-traditional notions of security?,"Non-traditional notions of security go beyond military threats to include a wide range of threats and dangers affecting the conditions of human existence. The entire human kind needs security, not just individuals or states according to the supporters of nontraditional notions of security. List of threatening humankind involves epidemic, famine and natural calamity.","[CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. 1. In the traditional conception of security, the greatest danger to a country is from military threats. The source of this danger is another country which by threatening military action endangers the core values of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. 2. Military action also endangers the lives of ordinary citizens. Q.10. What is the viewpoint of world towards war under traditional concept of security? Ans. It is now an almost universally accepted view that countries should only go to war for the right reasons, primarily self-defence or to protect other people from genocide. War must also be limited in terms of the means that are used. Armies must avoid killing or hurting non-combatants as well as unarmed and surrendering combatants. They should not be excessively violent. Force must in any case be used only after all the alternatives have failed. Q.11. What is meant by non-traditional notion of security? Differentiate between the narrow and the broad concept of human security. [CBSE (AI) 2016] Ans. Non-traditional notion of security are non-military threats such human security, climate change, environmental security, economic security, pandemics, social issues, etc. Human security is the combination of threats associated with war, genocide, and the displacement of populations. Human security in simple terms means freedom fromwant and ‘freedom from fear’. The narrow concept of human security includes security from violence that’s occurs from wars and armed conflicts. The broader concept of human security includes safety from economic, pandemic, environmental and social conflicts and unrests. Kofi Annan puts it as the protection of communities and individuals from internal violence. Q.12. What is the difference between traditional and non-traditional security? Which category would the creation and sustenance of alliances belong to? [NCERT] Or What are the differences between policies traditional and non-traditional security? [CBSE Delhi 2014, 2015] Ans. There are two policies of security: 1. Traditional policy 2. Non-traditional policy.
 Following are the differences between them: Traditional policy 1. There are more changes of military attack. 2. Ordinary men and women are madetargets of war along with the soldiers. 3. Only military comes under threat. 4. It is concerned with preventingwar, balance of power and formingalliances.
 Non-traditional policy 1. Non-traditional notions of securitygo beyond military threats to includea wide range of threats and dangersaffecting the conditions of humanexistence. 2. Whole human existence comesunder threat. 3. Threat involves epidemic, famineand natural calamity. 4. Countries are expected to increasemutual cooperation.

Whole human existence comesunder threat. 3. Threat involves epidemic, famineand natural calamity. 4. Countries are expected to increasemutual cooperation.
 Alliance building comes under traditional security. Many countries are involved in an alliance. They take steps in the direction of preventing war or defend against military attack. It aims at national interests. Q.13. What are the choices available to a state when its security is threatened, according to traditional security perspective? [NCERT] Ans. In the traditional conception of security, the greatest danger to a country is from military threats. The source of this danger is another country which by threatening military action endangers the core values of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. Agriculture, trade, business and industries of the region of war are affected adversely. Quite often, ordinary women and men are made targets of war to break their support to the war. In responding to the threat of a war, a government has three basic choices: 1. To surrender 2. To prevent the other side from attacking by promising to raise the costs of war to an unacceptable level; 3. To defend itself when war actually breaks out so as to deny the attacking country its objectives. Q.14. Distinguish between the internal and external notion of traditional security. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Internal notion of traditional security: (i) Internal military conflicts.

Which treaties were signed by US and USSR for arm control?,Following treaties were signed by US and USSR: 1. Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty 2. Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty 3. Strategic Arm Reduction Treaty 4. Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty,"Ans. Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT): This treaty banned nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water. It was signed by the US, UK and USSR in Moscow on 5 August, 1963. It entered into force on 10 October 1963. (i) Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT): This treaty was signed in Washington, London and Moscow on 1 July, 1968 at the same time and came into force on 5 March 1970. This treaty was extended indefinitely in 1995. It states that on 1 January, 1967, America, USSR (later Russia), Britain, France and China are five nuclear weapon states. As a result, it allowed only the nuclear weapon states to have nuclear weapons and stopped others from acquiring them. (ii) Strategic Arms Limitation Talks I (SALT-I): The first round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks began in November 1969 on a high level at America and USSR. After long conversation of two and half years, the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and the US President Richard Nixon signed the following in Moscow: • •
 Treaty on the limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile System (ABM Treaty). Interim Agreement on the limitation of strategic offensive arms.These two agreements or treaties were signed on 3 October, 1972.
 (iii) Strategic Arms Limitation Talks-II (SALT-II): After the above treaties came into force, second round was started immediately between the two superpowers. The US President Jimmy Carter and the soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev signed the treaty on the limitation of strategic offensive arms in Vienna on 18 June, 1979. (iv) Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty I (Start-I): This treaty was signed by the USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev and the US President George Bush (Senior). This treaty aims at the reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms. (v) Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II (Start-II): This treaty was signed by the Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the US President George Bush (Senior) on the reduction and limitation of strategic-offensive arms in Moscow on 3rd January, 1983. Q.6. Describe New International Economic Order (NIEO). Ans. Most of the non-aligned countries were newly independent which had just now got freedom from colonial rules. Their economy was backward and poverty, unemployment and other such miseries were common. The non-aligned countries were more than merely mediators during the Cold War. The challenge for most of the non-aligned countries – a majority of them were categorized as LDCs (Least Developed Countries) were to be more developed economically and to lift their people out of poverty. Economic development was also vital for the independence of new-countries. The idea of NewInternational Economic Order (NIEO) originated with this realization. The United Nation Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) brought out a report in 1972 entitled ‘Towards a New Trade Policy for development’. The report proposed a reform of the global trading system so as:
 2. Arms Control: Arms Control regulates the acquisition or development of weapons. The Anti-ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 1972 tried to stop the United States and Soviet Union from using ballistic missiles as a defensive shield to launch a nuclear attack. While it did allow both countries to deploy a very limited number of defensive systems, it stopped them from large-scale production of those systems. The US and Soviet Union signed a number of other arms control treaties including the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty II or SALT II and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). The Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 was an arms control treaty in the sense that it regulated the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Those countries that had tested and manufactured nuclear weapons before 1967were allowed to keep their weapons; and those that had done to were to give up the right to acquire them. 3. Confidence Building: Traditional security also accepts confidence building as a means of avoiding violence. Confidence building is a process in which countries share ideas and information with their rivals. They tell each other about their military intentions and, upto a point, their military plans. This is a way of show that they are not planning a surprise attack. They also update each other about the kind of forces they possess, and they may share information on where those forces are deployed. In short, confidence building is a process designed to ensure that countries do not go to war through misunderstanding or misperception. All in all, traditional conceptions of security are principally concerned with the use or threat of use of military force. In traditional security, force is both the principal threat to security and the principal means of achieving security. Q.5. Explain non-traditional conception of security. Ans. 1. Human security: Human security is all about the protection of people more than the protection of countries. Human security and state security should be same. But secure states do not automatically mean secure peoples. Protecting citizens from foreign attack may be a necessary condition for the security of individuals, but it is certainly not a sufficient one. Indeed, during the last 100 years, more people have been killed by their own governments than by foreign armies. All defenders of human security agree that its primary goal is the protection of individuals. However, there are differences about precisely what threats individuals should be protected from. Advocates of the ‘narrow’ concept of human security focus on violent threats to individuals or, as former UN secretary–General Kofi Annan puts it, “the protection of communities and individuals from internal violence.” Proponents of the ‘broad’ concept of human security argue that the threat agenda should include hunger, disease and natural disasters because these kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined. Human security policy, they argue, should protect people from these threats and violence too. In its broadest formulation, the human security agenda also envelops economic security and ‘threats’ to ‘human dignity’. Put differently, the expansive formulation stresses what has been called ‘freedom from wants’ and ‘freedom from fear’ respectively.
 "
Elaborate any one point to deal with terrorism as a new source of security threat. ,"In order to deal with terrorism an established perspective of life should be developed as compared to castes, religion and nationality. Moral values should be taught to people. They should be inspired to adopt values such as friendship, kindness and cooperation. They should be prevented from the influence of destructive powers.","[CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. Following are the reasons behind increasing terrorism on international level: 1. Information and Technology have paved way for terrorism in its way of execution. That is why, terrorism is a global problem all over the world. 2. Globalisation of economy is responsible behind the situations like theft, hijacking plains or planting of bombs, etc. The exchange of currency of any country has become easier for terrorists. 3. There is a competition of selling modernised weapons. The mastermind, government and traders are equally responsible behind spreading terror at individual level. 4. Advanced transport systems and mediums have enhanced terrorism. Q.8. Identify and elaborate any four sources of security threats. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. Following are the new sources of security threats: 1. Terrorism: It refers to political violence that targets civilians deliberately and indiscriminately. International terrorism involves the citizens or territory of more than one country. Terrorist groups seek to change a political context or condition that they do not like by force or threat of force. Civilian targets are usually chosen to terrorise the public and to use the unhappiness of the public as a weapon against national governments or other parties in conflict. 2. Global Poverty: Global Poverty is another source of insecurity. World population now at 650 crore will reach 700 to 800 within 25 years and may eventually level out of 900 to 1000 crore. Currently, half the world’s population growth occurs in just six countries—India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Among the World’s poorest countries, population is expected to triple in the next 50 years, whereas many rich countries will see population’s shrinkage in that period. High growth rate, high per capita income, high Education level and low population growth will make rich states or rich social groups get richer where as low growth rate, low per capita income, low education level and huge population growth reinforce each other to make poor states and poor groups become poorer. 3. Migration: Poverty in the South has also led to large-scale migration to seek a better life, especially better economic opportunities in the North. This has created international political frictions. International law and norms make a distinction between migrants and refugees. States are generally supposed to accept refugees,but they do not have to accept migrants. While refugees leave their country of origin, people who have fled their homes but remain within national borders are called internally displaced people. 4. Health Epidemics: Health Epidemics such as HIV-AIDS, bird flu, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have rapidly spread across countries through migration,

 "
How are human rights divided into three types?,Human rights have come to be classified into three types:  1. Political rights 2. Economic and Social rights  3. The rights of colonised people or ethnic and indigenous minorities.,"business, tourism and military operations. One country’s success or failure in limiting the spread of these diseases affects infections in other countries. By 2003, an estimated 4 crore people were infected with HIV-AIDS worldwide, twothirds of them in Africa and half of the rest in South Asia. Q.9. How many types of human rights are there? Ans. Human rights is an issue of human security. Human rights have come to be classified into three types: 1. Political Right seen as voting right, right to contest election and freedom of speech and assembly. 2. Economic and social rights such as right to earn, right to work, right of social security, etc. 3. Right to colonised people or ethnic and indigenous minorities. More emphasis have been given to these rights but there is no agreement on which set of rights should be considered as universal human rights, nor what the international community should do when rights are being violated. Since the 1990s, developments such as Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, the genocide in Rwanda, and the Indonesian military’s killing of people in East Timor have led to a debate on whether or not the UN should intervene to stop human rights abuses. There are those who argue that the UN charter empowers the international community totake up arms in defence of human rights. Others argue that the national interests of the powerful states will determine which instance of human right violations the UN should act upon. Q.10. List any four policy directive principles of state mentioned in Indian constitution to promote and international peace and security. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Measures of environmental protection, security to wild animals and increase in international peace and security have been mentioned in Article 51 of Indian constitution. On the basis of which India would regulate its foreign policy. Following are the principles: 1. To increase international peace and security. 2. To maintain justified and respectful relations between nations. 3. Foster respect for international law and treaty obligations in the dealings of organised peoples with one another. 4. To make efforts to mediate international controversies and promote settlement of international disputes by arbitration. Q.11. Explain the concept of ‘Human Security.’ [CBSE (AI) 2015]

Which two alternate centres arose/emerged after the end of bipolar structure?,"After the end of bipolar structure, in Europe, the European union (EU), and in Asia, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have emerged as forces to reckon with. While evolving regional solutions to their historical enmities and weaknesses, both the EU and the ASEAN have developed alternative institutions and conventions thatbuild a more peaceful and cooperative regional order and have transformed countries in the region into prosperous economies. The economic crises of China have made a dramatic impact on the world politics. All three of these, European Union, ASEAN and China emerged as alternative centres of powers and assessed their possible role in the future.","Q.1. To What did the European Union change from an economic union? Ans. The European union changed from an economic union to an increasing political one. Q.2. What was opposed by Denmark and Sweden? Ans. Treaty of Maastricht and adoption of Euro, currency of European Union were opposed by Denmark and Sweden. Q.3. How did India–China relations become bitter? Ans. Involvement of India and China in the Chinese takeover of Tibet in 1950 and the final settlement of the Sino-Indian border led bitterness among the two countries. Q.4. What are the opportunities of ASEAN security community? Ans. ASEAN security community is based on the conviction that outstanding territorial disputes should not escalate into armed confrontation. It has the following features: a. By 2003, ASEAN had several agreements in place by which member states promised to uphold peace, neutrality, cooperation, non-interference and respect for national differences and sovereign rights. b. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was established in 1994 to carry out coordination of security and foreign policy. Q.5. How does geographical proximity influence the formation of regional organisations? Ans. Geographical proximity influences the formation of regional organisations in the following manner: 1. Geographical proximity develops the feeling of integration of countries. 2. Since they have similar security issues, development of feeling of integration mediates the end of struggle and war. Peace and tranquility get a boost. 3. The military expense spent on mutual differences is thus saved. Moreover, expenses can be saved by collective security. 4. Expenses can be laid on to provide public facilities like agriculture, industries, transport, science and technology, health, etc. This helps in developing economy and bringing economic reforms.
 Q.6. Assess the role of ASEAN as an economic association. [CBSE (AI) 2016] Or Why does ASEAN still remain principally an economic association? [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. Role of ASEAN as an economic association: (i) ASEAN region as a whole is a much smaller economy compared to the E.U, the US and Japan. (ii) The economy of ASEAN region is growing much faster than that of the US, EU and Japan. (iii) This accounts for the growth in its influence both in the region and beyond. (iv) ASEAN is trying to create a common market and production base within the ASEAN States. (v) A mechanism is being evolved to settle and resolve the economic disputes. (vi) ASEAN has focused on creating a Free Trade Area for investment, labour and services. (vii) Its vision 2020 defined an outward looking role for ASEAN in the international community.

The People’s Republic of China in 1949 was established following the communist revolution under the leadership of Mao. The relations of Republic of China with economically backward capitalist countries continued from the rule of Chiang Kai-shek also ended. The reason behind this was the western countries under the leadership of US considered communist China as untouchable in the political world and thus were reluctant to establish any kind of diplomacy or trade and commerce with China.

An active initiation of this organisation brought success in paving a path for improving economy and for construction and development of Western European countries, which were ruined in the Second World War. Q.3. Outline the formation-process of European Union. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. European integration after 1945 was aided by the Cold War. America extended massive financial help for reviving Europe’s economy under what was called the ‘Marshall Plan’. Under the Marshall Plan, the organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) was established in 1948 to channel aid to the west European states. It became a forum where the western European states began to cooperate on trade and economic issues.

Name the pillars and objectives of the ASEAN Community. [NCERT] Ans. Countries of South-East Asia were under pressure of colonialism before the Second World War. The colonialism was of European countries like France, Britain and Holland. These countries, even after their independence had to suffer from miseries like poverty, illiteracy, scarcity of food, economic backwardness and formation of nation. They had to suffer from the hegemony of a single superpower after the end of Cold War. Bandung summit and NAM didn’t prove successful in promoting unity in Asia and third world countries. In this condition, five countries of South-East Asia namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand by signing the Bangkok Declaration in 1967, established Association for Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

The EU has started to act more as a national state. It has its own flag, anthem, founding date, and currency. It also has some forms of a common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations.","Ans. The formation of European Union was aided by the cold war. It became a forum for the Western European States to co-operate on trade and economic issues. It also laid stress on a common foreign and security policy, co-operation on justice and home affairs and the creation of a common currency. It has also started to act more as a nation state. While the attempts to have a Constitution for the EU have failed, still it has its own flag, anthem, founding date and currency. It also has some form of a common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations. It shows that European Union evolved over time from an economic union to an increasingly political one. Q.14. In what ways does the present Chinese economy differ from its command economy? [NCERT] Ans. The present Chinese economy differs from its command economy in many ways. This can be seen in Chinese perspective. After the revolution held under the leadership of Mao Tse Tung, China’s relations with capitalist countries completely came to an end. China had to survive on its own resources in spite of some assistance provided by Soviet Union. It invested capital from agriculture sector to set up industries at government level under government control. But China had to face lack of sufficient foreign capital in order to buy highly advanced equipments and material from the foreign market. Thus, China prepared imported goods at a domestic level. This system benefitted China in industrialisation of its economy. All citizens came under the area of employment and under the benefit of enjoying social welfare schemes as instruments/materials from all over the state were used. China took a front lead in educating and providing health facilities to its citizens. Its economy rose at a rate of 5-6 percent whereas its population growth was still at a rate of 2-3 per cent. In order to overcome such a situation, the Chinese leadership took major policy decisions in the 1970s. China established its relations with the United States in 1972. It gained UN membership as well. In 1973, Premier Zhou Enlai proposed the ‘four modernisations’ in agriculture, industry, science and technology and military. Its greatest change was noticed in 1978, when leader Deng Xiaoping announced the ‘open door’ policy and started economic reforms in India. This led to foreign investments in China and gross production was increased considerably. China was seen as an emerging superpower due to adoption of new policies. Its huge population is capable of consuming produced goods. But due to surplus production and Chinese rates, being less than other countries in market, China benefitted in the economic competition. But at the same time, it tried to control the problems ofincreasing population. In 1982, privatisation of agriculture led to remarkable increase in agricultural production and raise in rural incomes. High personal savings in the rural economy lead to an exponential growth in rural industry. In 2001, China became a member of ‘World Trade Organisation’ (WTO) and its economy opened to other countries. This attracted foreign investors. Present China’s economy seems as
 if it would became the World’s largest economy by 2040, thus leaving US behind. All the countries including US have now started to maintain a sound relationship, bypassing old issues. Q.15.

What were the reasons behind bitter relations of Indo-China?,"After China attacked Tibet, Dalai Lama eloped and came India. This led to enmities between the two countries. In 1950, after the Chinese takeover of Tibet, states like Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh were shown as a part of Chinese regions. China and India were involved in a border conflict in 1962 over competing territorial claims principally in Arunachal Pradesh and in Ladakh. The relations between the two countries were thus downgraded.","(i) Tibet Crises: After the revolution of 1949, Chinese leaders sent their troops in Tibet in 1950. India didn’t support this action but neither opposed this openly. In 1959, Dalai Lama eloped and came at India, this was considered as an act of enmity by China, which led to bitterness between China and India relations. (ii) Chinese on Indian region: After China controlled Tibet, a large portion of Arunachal in the south of NEFA and Ladakh was depicted as Chinese region. When India attracted China’s attention towards it, China tried to escape by giving an excuse that the map was formed under Chiang Kai-shek’s government. In the meanwhile, it laid a trap and roads, placed its military in those areas. India was completely unaware of China’s act because of the absence of roads that lead to these areas. (iii) Chinese attack of 1962: China and India were involved in a border conflict in 1962 over competing territorial claims principally in Arunachal Pradesh and in the Aksai Chin region of Ladakh. The conflict of 1962, in which India suffered military reverses, had long term implications for India-China relations. Due to public outrage and fearing the US interference, the war was ended but the geographical area that was captured by China during war is still under China. (iv) China supporting Pakistan: China always supported Pakistan and stood against India. It prepared a military in Kashmir region that was under Pakistan. It helped Pakistan and started revolting against India in international world. Pakistan received full assistance from China in Indo-Pak war in 1965 and 1971. It openly warned India regarding sikkim in 1971 and started calling India as ‘an attacker’. Following reforms can be suggested to improve India-China relations: 1. A new limit to resolve boundary conflicts should be proposed and no country shall cross the limit. 2. Leaders of both the countries should meet, time to time and mutual differences should be solved at verbal level. 3. India and China should promote agreements based on cultural exchanges and cooperation in science and technology. Exchange of computer related technology can be done between both the countries. 4. Both the countries should promote Free Trade Policy and should be concerned about their economic development by maintaining a sound relationship. 5. Expenses should be saved by establishing mutual peace and tranquillity. India and China should focus on common problems such as population, unemployment, poverty and backwardness by investing the expenses saved from safety budget. Q.13.

He signed various treaties to stop arms race with the US. He established peace by withdrawing Soviet troops from Afghanistan and Eastern Europe.

 Q.4. Explain any six reasons that forced Gorbachev to bring improvement in Soviet Union. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. The reasons that forced Gorbachev to bring improvements in Soviet Union are as follows: 1. Reforms were necessary to keep USSR abreast of information and technical revolution taking place in West. 2. Communist party had full control and was neutral towards aspirations of people of 15 countries. Hence, improvements were necessary. 3. Economic and political aspirations of people in USSR were not fulfilled. As a result, dissatisfaction kept on rising. Due to increasing dissatisfaction Gorbachev had to bring out reforms. 4. After the death of Brezhnev, Gorbachev took the leadership of Soviet Union. He was well aware of the fact that revolution of Information Technology had taken place in Western Countries and Soviet Union had taken a back seat in this. He decided to implement these improvements and introduced reform policies of
 ‘perestroika’(restructuring) and glasnost (openness). He decided to improve relations with Western countries along with America on the domestic front. 5. Gorbachev felt that economy had become stagnant. This led to shortage of all consumer goods. A large part of population started having doubted outlook for governing system. 6. The public of Soviet Union was dissatisfied with the bureaucratic and authoritarian system. In spite of similarities among all republics of Soviet Union, people felt neglected and suppressed due to increased domination of Russia. Members and managers at governing state had more facilities as compared to common people. This also led to public outrage. 7. A Coup took place in 1991, which was encouraged by Communist party hardliners. The people had tasted freedom by then and did not want the old-style rule of the communist party. All these factors forced Gorbachev to reform. Q.5. Describe the loopholes of Soviet System. [CBSE Delhi 2010] Ans. Soviet Union Emerged as a superpower after the Second World War. It developed in all areas but still it had the following loopholes which led to its destruction: 1. The economic, social and political life of Soviet citizens was fully under the control of state. Soviet system became very bureaucratic making life very difficult for its citizens. 2. Communist party of Soviet Union had a tight control over all institutions and was unaccountable to the people. The party bureaucrats gained more privilege than ordinary citizens, which increased in satisfaction among common citizens. 3. Lack of democracy and the absence of freedom of speech stifled people, who often expressed their dissent in jokes and cartoons. 4. The party refused to recognized the urge of people in the fifteen different republic that formed the Soviet union to manage their own affairs including their cultural affairs. Although on paper, Russia was only one of the fifteen republics that together constituted the USSR. But in reality, Russia dominated everything and people from other regions felt neglected and often suppressed. 5. In the arms race, the Soviet Union managed to match the US from time to time, but at great cost. The Soviet Union lagged behind the west in technology, infrastructure (e.g., transport, power) and most importantly, in fulfilling the political or economic aspirations of citizens. 6. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 weakened the system even further. Though wages continued to grow, productivity and technology fell considerably behind that of the West. This led to the shortages in all consumer goods. Food imports increased every year. Q.6. Explain process of disintegration of Soviet Union during the period of Mikhail Gorbachev.
 Ans. Mikhail Gorbachev became president of Soviet Union in 1985. Reforms were necessary to keep the USSR abreast of the information and technological revolutions taking place in West. To resolve this situation, he introduced reform policies of ‘perestroika’ (restructuring) and ‘glasnost’ (openness); However Gorbachev’s decision to normaliserelations with the West and democratise and reforms the Soviet Union had some other effects that neither he nor anyone else intended or anticipated. The people in the East European countries, which were earlier the part of the Soviet bloc started to protest against their own governments and Soviet control. Unlike in the past, the Soviet Union, under Gorbachev, did not intervene when the disturbances occurred and the communist regimes collapsed one after another. These developments were accompanied by a rapidly escalating crisis within the USSR that hastened its disintegration. Gorbachev initiated the policies of economic and political reform and democratisation within the country. The reforms were opposed by leaders within the communist party. This increased the speed of disintegration of Soviet Union. The effect of ‘Glasnost’ (openness) policy first took place in Lithuania. Movement for the freedom from USSR began. Soon it spread to Estonia and Latvia. But Gorbachev took the favour of Glasnost instead resolving the matter. In October 1989, he declared that Warsaw pact members were free to decide their own future. In the next month, November 1989, citizens of Germany toppled the Berlin Wall. In February 1990, elections held at Soviet Parliament (Duma). Gorbachev stripped the Soviet Communist Party of its 72 years old monopoly owned power by calling on the Soviet Parliament (Duma) to permit multiparty politics. It had surprising consequences. The communist party which ruled for last 72 years lost the elections. Lithunia declared its independence in March 1990. Russian Parliament declared its independence from Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin played an important role in this process. This was the most deepest indication of disintegration of Soviet Union. The public revolt that occurred to remove of communist party in all the republics of Soviet Union after falling of Berlin Wall in 1989 was so powerful that it wasn’t possible to resolve it with the help of military force. In December 1991, under the leadership of Yeltsin, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, three major republics of the USSR, declared that the Soviet Union was disbanded. And in this way, Soviet Union was disintegrated. Q.7. Explain how did the Cuban Missile Crisis drive the world on the brink of a nuclear war? [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. (i) In April 1961, the USSR was worried that USA would attack Cuba and overthrow the government of Fidel Castro. Therefore, the leaders of Cuba decided to convert the country into a Russian base. (ii) Consequently, the USSR placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. This strategic move put the USA for the first time, under the fire from close range.
 "
Eastern European countries came into which bloc?,Soviet bloc.,"Q.1. What was Soviet System? Ans. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR) came into being after the socialist revolution in Russia in 1917. The revolution was inspired by the ideals of socialism and the need for an egalitarian society. This attempt was to abolish the institution of private property and consciously design a society based on principles of equality. Q.2. Write two features of Soviet Union. [CBSE Delhi 2014] Or Explain any two features of Soviet Political System. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Two features of Soviet Political System are as follows: 1. To give preference to communist party without accepting any other political party’s identity. 2. To develop the economy, planned and controlled by the state. Q.3. What do you understand by ‘Second World’? Ans. After the Second World War, the nations of Eastern Europe came under the control of USSR. Soviet army had liberated them from facist forces. The political and economic system of all these countries were moulded as per USSR’s political and socialist ideals. This group of countries was termed as ‘Second World’ or ‘Socialist bloc’. Q.4. Which was the largest ‘garage sale’ in the history of Soviet Union? [CBSE (AI) 2009] Ans. In Russia, the large state–controlled industrial complex almost collapsed, as about 90 percent of its industries were put up for Sale to private individuals and companies. Since the restructuring was carried out through market forces and not by the government— directed industrial policies, it led to the disappearance of industries virtually. This was called the ‘largest garage sale in history’ as valuable industries were undervalued and sold at throwaway prices. Q.5. Write a brief description of Vladimir Lenin. Ans. Vladimir Lenin was a young theorist. Karl Marx’s theory of communism (against capitalism) inspired him. He founded Bolshevik communist party of Russia. In 1917, he
 "
What was the name of the military alliance formed by Soviet Union?,Warsa Pact.,"Explain balance of power as a component of traditional security policy. How could a state achieve this balance? [CBSE Delhi 2016] Ans. Traditional notion of external security– The greatest danger to a country is from military threats. The source of such a security threat emerges from another country which, through its military action, threatens the core values of sovereignity, independence and territorial integrity. Military action even endangers the life of ordinary residents of a country. In a war, it is highly unlikely that only soldiers would die or be hurt. In all the likelihood, men and women, who are ordinary citizens and soft targets are made victims in a war, to break their support for the war. Components of external security: 1. Avoidance of War: Governments may even make the choice of surrender when actually in a war, but this may not be promoted as a country’s defence policy. Security policy, is hence, concerned with preventing war, which is known as deterrence, and with limiting or ending war, which is called defence. 2. Balance of Power: Every country looks around to see potential bigger or stronger countries which can pose as a threat in the future. For instance, a neighbouring country might not declare that it is preparing for an attack. But the very fact, that the neighbour is powerful, points to the fact that in future the neighbour can be aggressive. Over here we can cite the example of South Asia. Even though India has never declared that it would attack upon its neighbours– Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, etc., yet these countries are skeptical about India’s military designs because of its preparedness, size and potential. All governments, are therefore, quite sensitive to the ‘Balance of Power’ between their country and other states. They strive hard to maintain a favourable balance with the other states especially with those with whom they had differences or conflicts in the past. For maintaining balance of power, they build up military power along with economic and technological power as the latter two are the very basis of a country’s hand or military power. Q.4.Write a note on ‘ways of traditional security policy’. Ans. The most important of these are disarmament arms control and confidence building: 1. Disarmament: It requires all states to give up certain kinds of weapons. For example, the 1972 Biological weapons convention (BWC) and the 1992 Chemical weapons convention (CWC) banned the production and possession of these weapons. More than 155 states acceded to the BWC and 181 states acceded to the CWC. Both conventions include all the great powers. But the superpowers — the US and Soviet Union did not want to give up the third type of weapons of mass destruction, namely, nuclear weapons, so they pursued arms control.
 2. Arms Control: Arms Control regulates the acquisition or development of weapons. The Anti-ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 1972 tried to stop the United States and Soviet Union from using ballistic missiles as a defensive shield to launch a nuclear attack. While it did allow both countries to deploy a very limited number of defensive systems, it stopped them from large-scale production of those systems. The US and Soviet Union signed a number of other arms control treaties including the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty II or SALT II and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). The Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 was an arms control treaty in the sense that it regulated the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Those countries that had tested and manufactured nuclear weapons before 1967were allowed to keep their weapons; and those that had done to were to give up the right to acquire them. 3. Confidence Building: Traditional security also accepts confidence building as a means of avoiding violence. Confidence building is a process in which countries share ideas and information with their rivals. They tell each other about their military intentions and, upto a point, their military plans. This is a way of show that they are not planning a surprise attack. They also update each other about the kind of forces they possess, and they may share information on where those forces are deployed. In short, confidence building is a process designed to ensure that countries do not go to war through misunderstanding or misperception. All in all, traditional conceptions of security are principally concerned with the use or threat of use of military force. In traditional security, force is both the principal threat to security and the principal means of achieving security. Q.5. Explain non-traditional conception of security. Ans. 1. Human security: Human security is all about the protection of people more than the protection of countries. Human security and state security should be same. But secure states do not automatically mean secure peoples. Protecting citizens from foreign attack may be a necessary condition for the security of individuals, but it is certainly not a sufficient one. Indeed, during the last 100 years, more people have been killed by their own governments than by foreign armies. All defenders of human security agree that its primary goal is the protection of individuals. However, there are differences about precisely what threats individuals should be protected from. Advocates of the ‘narrow’ concept of human security focus on violent threats to individuals or, as former UN secretary–General Kofi Annan puts it, “the protection of communities and individuals from internal violence.” Proponents of the ‘broad’ concept of human security argue that the threat agenda should include hunger, disease and natural disasters because these kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined. Human security policy, they argue, should protect people from these threats and violence too. In its broadest formulation, the human security agenda also envelops economic security and ‘threats’ to ‘human dignity’. Put differently, the expansive formulation stresses what has been called ‘freedom from wants’ and ‘freedom from fear’ respectively.

Was this the best way to make a transition from communism to capitalism? [NCERT] Ans. Most of the Soviet Union republics went through painful process of transition from an authoritarian socialist system to a democratic capitalist system after the collapse of communism. The model of transition in Russia, Central Asia and East Europe was influenced by World Bank and the IMF came to be known as ‘Shock therapy’. Shock therapy varied in intensity and speed amongst the former second world countries, but its direction and features remained the same. Each of these countries was required to make a total shift to a capitalist economy, which meant rooting out completely any structures evolved during the Soviet period. Above all, it meant that private ownership was to be the dominant pattern of ownership of property. Privatisation of state assets and corporate ownership patterns were to be immediately brought in. Collective forms were to be replaced by private farming and capitalism in agriculture. This transition ruled out any alternate or ‘third way’, other than state-controlled socialism or capitalism.

Q.6. ‘Despite the mixed record of the democratic experience, the people in all these countries share the aspiration for democracy.’ Explain. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are included in South Asia. They stand for diversity in every sense. The various countries in South Asia do not have the same kind of political systems. Sri Lanka and India have democratic system. Pakistan and Bangladesh have experienced both civilian and military rulers. Nepal has a constitutional monarchy but democracy has established there as well. Maldives has also achieved democracy. The social dominance of the military, clergy and landowning aristocracy has led to the frequent overthrow of elected governments and the establishment of military government in Pakistan. Pakistan’s conflict with India has made the pro-military groups more powerful. Democratic system was adopted in Bangladesh after its independence. Soon afterwards, Sheikh Mujib abolished all the parties except his own, which led to conflicts and tensions. He was assassinated in a military uprising in August 1975 and military rule was established. Democracy was again established there due to public outrage. Nepal had a constitutional monarchy but due to public revolt, democraticconstitution was given acceptance in 1990. In 2002, king Gyanendra abolished the parliament and dismissed the government. Process of establishing democracy had started after elections held in 2007. Presently, democracy has been established there. Democracy is playing an active role in Bhutan and Maldives as well. Q.7. Write any two reasons of public outrage of eastern Pakistan (Present Bangladesh) against Western Pakistan. [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. 1. The people of this region resented the domination of Western Pakistan and the imposition of the Urdu language. Soon after the partition, they began protests against the unfair treatment meted out to the Bengali culture and language. They also demanded fair representation in administration and a fair share in political power. 2. National Assembly elections were held in 1970. The Awami League led by Sheikh Mujib ur Rehman won all the seats in East Pakistan and secured a majority in the proposed constituent assembly for the whole of Pakistan. But the government dominated by the West Pakistani leadership refused to convene the assembly. Sheikh Mujib ur Rehman was arrested. Public of eastern Bengal outraged and demanded for independence.

India’s relations with Russia and an important aspect of India’s foreign policy. Indo-Russian relations are embedded in a history of trust and common interests and are matched by popular preceptions. Indian heroes from Raj Kapoor to Amitabh Bachchan are household names in Russia and Many post-Soviet countries. One can hear Hindi film songs all over the region, and India is part of popular memory. Russia and India share a vision of a multipolar world order. What they mean by a multipolar world order is the co-existence of several powers in the international system. Collective security greater regionalism, negotiated settlements of international conflicts, an independent foreign policy for all countries and decision making through bodies like the UN that should be strengthened, democratised and empowered. More than 80bilateral agreements have been signed between India and Russia as part of the Indo Russia strategic Agreements of 2001. India stands to benefit from its relationship with Russia on the issues like Kashmir, energy supplies, sharing information on international terrorism, access to Central Asia, and balancing its relations with China. Russia stands to benefit from this relationship because India is the second largest arms market for Russia. The Indian military gets most of its hardware from Russia. Q.19. Write an essay for or against the following proposition. With the disintegration of the Second World, India should change its foreign policy and focus more on friendship with the US rather than with traditional friends like Russia. [NCERT] Ans. The arguments in favour and against the statement are as follows: Arguments in favour: Unipolar system was originated in the World after the disintegration of Soviet Union. USA was the only superpower on international front. The war which continued for so many years between communist and capitalist ideology was finally ended along with the disintegration of Soviet Union. The capitalist system had proved its superiority over communist system. That’s why India needs to change its foreign policies and should lend a hand of friendship towards America. America wants to establish trade relationship with India for its own interest. So, India should be conscious while establishing its trade relationships and should exercise the friendship of superpower of the world to its own interests. Arguments in against: Indo-Soviet relations have always been cordial. Russia had always helped India. Although, India was a non-aligned country, even then Soviet Union provided India with economic and military assistance at the time of Bangladesh crises in 1971. Indo-Soviet relations became deeper after Tashkent treaty to avoid Indo Pak War. Indo-Russian relations were cordial even after disintegration of Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin visited India on 27 January 1993, where he signed an Indo-Russian treaty for military and technical agreement. India stood benefitted from its relationship with Russia on issues like Kashmir. On 23 December 1994, the Russian P.M. visited India and
 agreement was signed between both the countries for military, technology and trade. Russia supported India during Indo-Pak War. On 7 December 1999, a ten-year agreement between India and Russia was signed. According to this, Indo-Russia would collectively produce military and non-military aircrafts. Indian nuclear tests were supported by Russia in 1998. By keeping in mind all the above factors, we reach on a conclusion that India should not be much dependent on America after having Russia, as a trusted friend. The following are the reasons for the above conclusion: 1. America forced Britain to free India but it opposed India when India adopted nonalignment policy after independence. Instead, it supported Pakistan, India’s rival country and started providing military assistance to Pakistan. 2. America doesn’t want India to emerge as a powerful nation. It opposed India’s nuclear tests and forced India to sign Nuclear Treaty CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty). India always stood against America’s dual policy. 3. America also adopts a dual policy on the issue of terrorism. It says India to remain patient on the issue of Pakistan’s terror attacks. On the contrary, it attacked Afghanistan, causing huge devastation when it was under terror attack. 4. Indo-America’s relationship can’t be as cordial as Pak-America relationship. Pakistan has always been a country of America’s alliance and also gained military assistance from America. Q.20. There had always been an apprehension and risk of struggle and tension in most of the former Soviet Republics. Explain with any 3 examples. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Or Explain the struggle and tension in former Soviet Republics. Ans. Bipolarity has collapsed. Second World War didn’t end the struggle and tension in former Soviet Republics. Most of the former Soviet Republics are prone to conflict and many had civil wars and insurgencies. Growing involvement of outside power had complicated the picture. Some examples are as follows:
 1. In Russia, two republics Chechnya and Dagestan had violent secessionist movements. Moscow’s method while dealing with the Chechen rebel and indiscriminate military bombing had led to many human right violations but it failed to deter the aspirations for independence. 2. In Central Asia, Tajikistan witnessed a civil war for ten years, till 2001. The region as whole has many sectarian conflicts. 3.

Bill Clinton was the President of USA for eight years. He belonged to ‘Democratic Party’.
 Ans. Mikhail Gorbachev became president of Soviet Union in 1985. Reforms were necessary to keep the USSR abreast of the information and technological revolutions taking place in West. To resolve this situation, he introduced reform policies of ‘perestroika’ (restructuring) and ‘glasnost’ (openness); However Gorbachev’s decision to normaliserelations with the West and democratise and reforms the Soviet Union had some other effects that neither he nor anyone else intended or anticipated. The people in the East European countries, which were earlier the part of the Soviet bloc started to protest against their own governments and Soviet control. Unlike in the past, the Soviet Union, under Gorbachev, did not intervene when the disturbances occurred and the communist regimes collapsed one after another. These developments were accompanied by a rapidly escalating crisis within the USSR that hastened its disintegration. Gorbachev initiated the policies of economic and political reform and democratisation within the country. The reforms were opposed by leaders within the communist party. This increased the speed of disintegration of Soviet Union. The effect of ‘Glasnost’ (openness) policy first took place in Lithuania. Movement for the freedom from USSR began. Soon it spread to Estonia and Latvia. But Gorbachev took the favour of Glasnost instead resolving the matter. In October 1989, he declared that Warsaw pact members were free to decide their own future. In the next month, November 1989, citizens of Germany toppled the Berlin Wall. In February 1990, elections held at Soviet Parliament (Duma). Gorbachev stripped the Soviet Communist Party of its 72 years old monopoly owned power by calling on the Soviet Parliament (Duma) to permit multiparty politics. It had surprising consequences. The communist party which ruled for last 72 years lost the elections. Lithunia declared its independence in March 1990. Russian Parliament declared its independence from Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin played an important role in this process. This was the most deepest indication of disintegration of Soviet Union. The public revolt that occurred to remove of communist party in all the republics of Soviet Union after falling of Berlin Wall in 1989 was so powerful that it wasn’t possible to resolve it with the help of military force. In December 1991, under the leadership of Yeltsin, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, three major republics of the USSR, declared that the Soviet Union was disbanded. And in this way, Soviet Union was disintegrated. Q.7. Explain how did the Cuban Missile Crisis drive the world on the brink of a nuclear war? [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. (i) In April 1961, the USSR was worried that USA would attack Cuba and overthrow the government of Fidel Castro. Therefore, the leaders of Cuba decided to convert the country into a Russian base. (ii) Consequently, the USSR placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. This strategic move put the USA for the first time, under the fire from close range.

Thus, Environment became the priority issue for countries. Q.16. ‘The global economy relied on oil for much of the 20th century.’ Explain. Ans. The global economy relied on oil for much of the 20th century as a portable and imperative fuel. The immense wealth associated with oil generates political struggles to control it, and the history of petroleum is also the history of war and struggle. Nowhere is this more obviously the case than in West Asia and Central Asia. West Asia, specifically the Gulf region, accounts for about 30 per cent of global oil production. But it has about 64 percent of the planet’s known reserve, and is therefore the only region able to satisfy any substantial raise in oil demand. Saudi Arabia has a quarter of the world’s total reserve and is the single target producer. Iraq’s known reserve are second only to Saudi Arabia’s. And since substantial portions of Iraqi territory are yet to be fully explored, there is a fair chance that actual reserve might be far larger. The United States, Europe, Japan, and increasingly India and China, which consume this petroleum, are located at a considerable distance from the region. Q.17. What distinguishes the forest movements of the South from those of the North? Ans. Forest movements of the South and those of the North vary largely. Countries of eastern are believed to be deprived of forests. Human are not seen as part of nature and try to protect environment from human. While most environmental issues in the South are based on the assumption that people live in the forests. Wilderness-oriented perspectives have been predominant in Australia, Scandinavia, North America and New Zealand. In these regions, there are still large tracts of relatively underdeveloped wilderness. Wilderness campaigns are active in the South. In the Phillippines, green organisations fought to protect eagles and other birds of prey from extinctions. In India, a battle goes on to protect the alarmingly low number of Bengal tigers. In Africa, a long campaign has been waged against the ivory trade and the savage slaughter of elephants. All of these campaigns focus on individual species as well as the conservation of the wild habitats, which support them. Many of these campaigns have been initiated and funded by NGOs such as the world wide wildlife fund (WWF), in association with local people. Q.18. What was the ‘Earth Summit’? How far did the summit prove to be useful? Explain. [CBSE (AI) 2016 Ans. Earth Summit was a conference on environment and development held in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) in June 1992.

There are five permanent members and ten non-permanent members. America, Britain, China, France and Russia are its permanent members. The non-permanent members serve for only two years at a time. There are two ways to vote to take decision in Security council. In Procedural means, vote of atleast 9 members out of 15 members should be in favour of the proposal. While taking decisions related to military, finance or other important issues, all five permanent nations should agree in addition to the votes in favour of the proposal. In other words, the proposal does not pass if any one of the permanent member is not in its favour, irrespective of the number of votes came in its favour. This process of election in the security council is known as ‘veto’ power of the permanent-members of the UN. The Security Council is a powerful organistion of the UN. It can give directions to other countries to resolve conflicts between nations or can solve them by intervention, maintaining peace, law, order and security by resolving conflicts as it is the responsibility of the Security Council. If these peaceful ways do not work, then the Security Council adopts coercive method before war. It can even order the country found guilty to break trade-commerce-financial and diplomatic relations. If coercive method does not work, then military actions against the country found guilty, can also be taken. Reforms in structure of the Security Council can pave way for the UN’s improvement as the Security Council is the backbone of the UN. The structure of the Security Council is such that it plays role of a judge in all matters, so UN cannot be improved without structural reforms in the Security Council. Q.17. Although UN has failed to act as effective checks on the hegemony of US, nations prefer its continuation. Suggest any three suitable arguments to justify the relevance of UN in the post-cold war era. [CBSE Sample Paper 2016] Ans. Relevance of UN in the post-cold war period: (i) In the unipolar world, the UN can and has served to bring US and rest of the world into discussion on various issues.

IAEA teams regularly inspect nuclear facilities. Q.16. What is World Trade Organisation? Ans. The World Trade Organisation is an international organisation, which sets the rules for global trade. This organisation was set up in 1995 as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) created after the second world war. It has 164 member.

The developing countries often complain of non-transparent procedures and being pushed around by big powers. Q.17. Which three elements of resolution for the reform in structures and processes of UN are reflected and adopted by General Assembly? Ans. Three elements of resolution for the reform in structures and processes are as follows: 1. The security council of UN no longer represents contemporary political realities. 2.

Technology promises to increase planetary interdependence, and therefore the importance of the UN will only enhance. People and government will have to find ways to gain support and using the UN and other international organisations in ways that are consistent with their own interests and the interests of the International community more broadly.

What do you understand by International Atomic Energy Agency?,The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established in 1957. It came into being to implement US president Dwight Eisenhower’s ‘Atoms for peace’ proposal. It seeks to  promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to prevent its use for military purposes. IAEA teams regularly inspect nuclear facilities.,"2. Arms Control: Arms Control regulates the acquisition or development of weapons. The Anti-ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 1972 tried to stop the United States and Soviet Union from using ballistic missiles as a defensive shield to launch a nuclear attack. While it did allow both countries to deploy a very limited number of defensive systems, it stopped them from large-scale production of those systems. The US and Soviet Union signed a number of other arms control treaties including the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty II or SALT II and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). The Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 was an arms control treaty in the sense that it regulated the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Those countries that had tested and manufactured nuclear weapons before 1967were allowed to keep their weapons; and those that had done to were to give up the right to acquire them. 3. Confidence Building: Traditional security also accepts confidence building as a means of avoiding violence. Confidence building is a process in which countries share ideas and information with their rivals. They tell each other about their military intentions and, upto a point, their military plans. This is a way of show that they are not planning a surprise attack. They also update each other about the kind of forces they possess, and they may share information on where those forces are deployed. In short, confidence building is a process designed to ensure that countries do not go to war through misunderstanding or misperception. All in all, traditional conceptions of security are principally concerned with the use or threat of use of military force. In traditional security, force is both the principal threat to security and the principal means of achieving security. Q.5. Explain non-traditional conception of security. Ans. 1. Human security: Human security is all about the protection of people more than the protection of countries. Human security and state security should be same. But secure states do not automatically mean secure peoples. Protecting citizens from foreign attack may be a necessary condition for the security of individuals, but it is certainly not a sufficient one. Indeed, during the last 100 years, more people have been killed by their own governments than by foreign armies. All defenders of human security agree that its primary goal is the protection of individuals. However, there are differences about precisely what threats individuals should be protected from. Advocates of the ‘narrow’ concept of human security focus on violent threats to individuals or, as former UN secretary–General Kofi Annan puts it, “the protection of communities and individuals from internal violence.” Proponents of the ‘broad’ concept of human security argue that the threat agenda should include hunger, disease and natural disasters because these kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined. Human security policy, they argue, should protect people from these threats and violence too. In its broadest formulation, the human security agenda also envelops economic security and ‘threats’ to ‘human dignity’. Put differently, the expansive formulation stresses what has been called ‘freedom from wants’ and ‘freedom from fear’ respectively.

[CBSE (AI) 2016] Ans. UN Security Council is an important organ of United Nations. It has fifteen members – five permanent and ten elected by the General Assembly for two year terms. Difference in the privileges between permanent and non-permanent members: (i) The main privileges of the permanent members are permanency and the veto power, which can neglect any resolution of the Security Council. (ii) The non-permanent members serve for only two years at a time. A country cannot be re-elected immediately after completing their term. They do not have Veto power. (iii) The permanent members were not chosen through an election while nonpermanent members are elected by general assembly. Q.15. Though the UN has failed in preventing wars and related miseries, nations prefer its continuation. What makes the UN an indispensable organisation? [NCERT] Ans. Though the UN has failed in preventing wars and related miseries, nations prefer its continuation. Following are the reasons behind this thinking: 1. UN has failed in preventing small scale war. But the greatest success of UN lies in preventing the whole world from third world war which can destroy the human kind. 2. UN is the only international organisation in which 193 member countries are included. It provides a platform to discuss on issues like international peace, security, economy, social aspects with open minds. 3. It is the only platform where mutual differences are settled not by war but peacefully by filing a complaint against each other in UN security council. It has prohibited the use of chemicals and nuclear weapons.
 4. UN provides medical aid in emergency and loan from World Bank and IMF to backward countries. 5. Works on certain areas like – education, epidemic, health and terrorism which cannot be done without international cooperation. 6. Unipolar system is there in the world and US hegemony is seen in the world. UN can control US. It can hold a discussion between US and other countries on certain issues. UN, alongwith its member nations can react to US hegemony and actions. Q.16. ‘Reforming the UN means restructuring of the security council.’ Do you agree with this statement? Give arguments for or against this position. [NCERT] Ans. Security Council is an integral part of the United Nations. It acts as UN’s executive head. There are five permanent members and ten non-permanent members. America, Britain, China, France and Russia are its permanent members. The non-permanent members serve for only two years at a time. There are two ways to vote to take decision in Security council. In Procedural means, vote of atleast 9 members out of 15 members should be in favour of the proposal. While taking decisions related to military, finance or other important issues, all five permanent nations should agree in addition to the votes in favour of the proposal. In other words, the proposal does not pass if any one of the permanent member is not in its favour, irrespective of the number of votes came in its favour. This process of election in the security council is known as ‘veto’ power of the permanent-members of the UN. The Security Council is a powerful organistion of the UN. It can give directions to other countries to resolve conflicts between nations or can solve them by intervention, maintaining peace, law, order and security by resolving conflicts as it is the responsibility of the Security Council. If these peaceful ways do not work, then the Security Council adopts coercive method before war. It can even order the country found guilty to break trade-commerce-financial and diplomatic relations. If coercive method does not work, then military actions against the country found guilty, can also be taken. Reforms in structure of the Security Council can pave way for the UN’s improvement as the Security Council is the backbone of the UN. The structure of the Security Council is such that it plays role of a judge in all matters, so UN cannot be improved without structural reforms in the Security Council. Q.17. Although UN has failed to act as effective checks on the hegemony of US, nations prefer its continuation. Suggest any three suitable arguments to justify the relevance of UN in the post-cold war era. [CBSE Sample Paper 2016] Ans. Relevance of UN in the post-cold war period: (i) In the unipolar world, the UN can and has served to bring US and rest of the world into discussion on various issues.

Though UN is an imperfect body but can the world survive without its presence?,"The UN is an imperfect body, but without it, the World would be worse off. Given the growing connection and interdependence, it is hard to imagine how more than seven billion people would live together without an organisation such as the UN. Technology promises to increase planetary interdependence, and therefore the importance of the UN will only enhance. People and government will have to find ways to gain support and using the UN and other international organisations in ways that are consistent with their own interests and the interests of the International community more broadly.  ","(iii) The UN consists of many structures and agencies (iv) War, peace, and difference between the member states are discussed in the General Assembly. (v) Social and Economic issues are dealt with by many agencies including WTO, UNDP, UNHRC, UNICEF and UNESCO. (Any four points or any other relevant points) Q.6. Write the importance of the UN in unipolar world. Ans. With the disappearance of the Soviet Union, the US stands as the only superpower. Its military and economic power allow it to ignore the UN or any other international organisation. Secondly, within the UN, the influence of the US is considerable. As the single largest contributor to the UN, the US has unmatched Financial power. The fact that the UN is physically located within the US territory gives it additional influence. The power of the US and its veto power the US can stop any moves that it finds annoying or damaging toits interests or the interest of its friends and allies. The UN is not therefore a great balance to the US, Nevertheless, in a unipolar world in which the US is dominant, only the UN can initiate the talks between the US and various countries on different issues. UN provides an arena in which it is possible to modify US attitudes and policies. UN does provide a space within which argument and policies are heard and compromises and concessions can be shaped. The UN is an imperfect body, but without it the world would be worse off. Given the growing connections and independence, it is hard to imagine how more than seven billion people would live together without an organisation such as the UN. Q.7. List any four steps proposed by the member countries of UN in 2005 to make it more contemporary in the world. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Or Keeping in view the changed scenario, highlight any four steps taken by the member countries in 2005 to make the UN more contemporary. [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. The Question of UN membership is a serious one. As the UN completed 60 years of its existence, the heads of all the member-states met in September 2005 to celebrate the anniversary and review the situation. The leaders in this meeting decided that the following steps should be taken to make the UN more relevant in the changing context. 1. Creation of a peace building commission. 2. Acceptance of the responsibility of the international community in case of failure of national governments to protect their own citizens from atrocities. 3. Establishment of a Human Rights Council (Operational since 19th June, 2016)

Define ‘Globalisation’.,"Globalisation is a process in which views, theories, ideologies and human values in one country affect the lives of other countries of the earth by flow and communication.","Q.1 What is globalisation? Enlighten any three reasons for globalisation. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Or Define globalisation. Explain any three reasons for globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Globalisation means globalise the social relationship in such a way that events taking place in some parts of the world could have an impact on another part of the world. Thus, globalisation is a process in which whole earth became a global village, in which socio-economic contact is based on mutual cooperation. Main reasons for Globalisation are as follows: 1. Revolution in Communication Technique: Technology remains a critical element. There is no doubt that the invention of telegraph, the telephone, and the microchip in more recent times has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. When printing initially came into being, it laid the basis for the creation of nationalism. Technology has affected us at individual and collective levels. Technological advancements have stimulated the transfer and movement of capital, thoughts, commodities and people from one part of the world to another and that too, easily. The movement of capital and commodities has been more than the movement of peoples across different parts of the world. 2. Flow of Capital and Commodities: Economic concept of the world has to play an important role in world politics. The mention of economic globalisation draws our attention immediately to the role of international institutions like IMF and the WTO and the role they play in determining economic policies across the world. Yet globalisation must not be viewed in such narrow terms. Economic globalisation involves many factors other than these international institutions. A much broader way of understanding of economic globalisation require us to look at the distribution of economic gains, i.e., who get the most from globalisation and who gets less, indeed who loses from it. 3. Impact of an event on all the people of World: Globalisation, however, does not emerge merely because of the availability of improved communications. What is important is for people in different parts of the world is to recognise these interconnections with the rest of the world. Currently, we are aware of the fact that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on the another part of the world. The Bird Flu or Tsunami is not confined to any particular nation. It does not respect national boundaries. Similarly, when major economic events take place, their
 impact is felt outside their immediate local, national or regional environment at the international level. Q.2. What is global ‘mutual connection’? What are its components? [NCERT] Ans. Global mutual connection means the free flow of ideas, capital commodities and people from one part of the world to another. In present times, different parts of world have come close to each other. And its credit goes to the development of means of communication. The invention of telegraph, the telephone and the microchips has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. Printing connected people living at different corners of the globe. But Globalisation however does not emerge merely because of the availability of improved communications. But people in different partsof the world recognise that they are connected to each other. Currently, we are aware of the fact that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on another part of the world like Bird Flu or Tsunami. Q.3. How do technologies contribute in the direction of globalisation? Explain. [CBSE Delhi 2013, CBSE Delhi 2015] Or How has technology contributed to the globalisation? [NCERT] Ans. Revolution in Communication Technique: Technology remains a critical element. There is no doubt that the invention of telegraph, the telephone, and the microchip in more recent times has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. When printing initially came into being, it laid the basis for the creation of nationalism. Technology has affected us at individual and collective levels. Technological advancements have stimulated the transfer and movement of capital, thoughts, commodities and people from one part of the world to another and that too, easily. The movement of capital and commodities has been more than the movement of peoples across different parts of the world. Q.4. Why is globalisation a multidimensional concept? Ans. Globalisation is a multidimensional concept because it cannot be limited within a certain sphere. Its effect can be seen in all the sectors like economic, political and cultural. It would be a blunder to accept globalisation only as an economic, political or a cultural event. The impact of globalisation is vastly uneven— it affects some parts more than others. Q.5. Define globalisation. Explain any one criticism for globalisation. [CBSE Delhi (C) 2014]
 Ans.Globalisation means globalise the social relationship in such a manner that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on another part of the world. Thus globalisation is a process in which whole earth became a global village, in which socioeconomic contact is based on mutual corporation. Apart from the sphere of economics and politics, Globalisation has affected us culturally. What we eat, drink, think and wear reflect our culture. Imposition of Western Culture on the rest of the world is leading the world to homogenous culture. It is the result of US Hegemony. Cultures seeking to buy into the dominant American dream is dangerous not only for poor countries but also for the whole of humanity, for it might lead to the shinkage of the rich cultural heritage of the entire globe. Q.6. Clarify any two positive and any two negative effects of globalisation. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. Two positive effects of globalisation are as follows: (i) As a consequence of globalisation, enhanced technologies are available with states. With these technologies, it has become easy for state to collect information about its citizens. (ii) Globalisation improves economical aspects. Economic policy of openness makes business flourish. The countries following these policies progress and prosper immensely. Negative effects of globalisation are as follows: (i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. (ii) Powerfully influenced by the American way of life, globalisation has given rise to the cultural pollution in many countries of the world. Q.7. Explain any four reasons for resistance to globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. Following are the reasons for the resistance to globalisation: (i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that make the rich richer and the poor poorer. (ii) Wea kening of the state leads to the reduction in the capacity of the state to protect the interests of its citizens, especially poor. (iii) Many countries also fear the weakening of state in political terms. Economically, they want a return to self-reliance and protectionism, at least in certain areas of the economy.
 Q.1. Define ‘Globalisation’. Ans. Globalisation is a process in which views, theories, ideologies and human values in one country affect the lives of other countries of the earth by flow and communication. Q.2. What are the types of flow there? Ans. Flow are of following types: (i) Flow of ideas from one place to another place of world, (ii) Flow of Capital for more than one year, (iii) Flow of commodity in many countries, (iv) Visit of people in different countries to earn livelihood. Q.3. List the factors responsible for globalisation. Ans. (i) Development of Technologies. (ii) Awareness among the people of different parts of the world that they all are interconnected in one way or the other. Q.4.

Awareness among the people of different parts of the world that they all are interconnected in one way or the other.,Benefits of Globalisation: 1. 2. 3. 4.  There is an increase in the volume of trade in goods and services. Inflow of private foreign capital gets enhanced. New jobs are created by MNCs. Improved production efficiency and healthy competition. (Any two points) ,"Q.1. Explain any three advantages of Globalisation with examples. [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. Three advantages of Globalisation are as follows: 1. Political Advantages: State also gains political benefit due to globalisation. State can work efficiently by collecting information about its citizen by technology. Globalisation intensifies closeness between countries. Event occurs in one part of the world and also affects other parts of the world. States become more powerful than they were earlier as a result of globalisation. The primary of the state continues to be the unchallenged basis of political community. The state continues to discharge its essential functions (Law and order, national security) and consciously withdraws from certain domains from which it wishes. With enhanced technologies available at the disposal of the state, they can collect information about its citizens. With this information, the state is able to rule better, not less able. Thus, state becomes more powerful. 2. Economic Advantages: Globalisation has involved greater trade in commodities across the globe; the restrictions imposed by different countries on allowing the imports of the other countries have been reduced. Similarly, the restrictions on the movement of Capital across countries have also been reduced. Now the investor can invest his money anywhere in the world. Advocates of economic globalisation argue that it generates greater economic growth and well being for larger sections of the population when there is de-regulation. Greater trade among countries allows each economy to do what it does the best. This would benefit the whole world. 3. Cultural Advantages: Globalisation leads to the rise of a uniform culture. Cultures are not static things. All culture accept outside influences all the time. Sometimes external influences simply enlarge our choices, and sometimes they modify our cultures without overwhelming the traditional. The burger is no substitute for a Sambhar Vada and, therefore, does not pose any real challenge. It is simply added on to our food choices. Blue jeans, on the other hand, can go well with a homespun khadi kurta. It is interesting that this unique combination has been exported back to the country that gave us blue jeans. Globalisation lead to each culture becoming more different and distinctive. Q.2. What initiatives did India take for globalisation? Ans. India took the following initiatives for Globalisation: 1. Reforms in trade policy: These reforms in trade policy by India were carried out. •

(b) Trade unions of industrial work force as well those representing farmer interests have organised protests against the entry of multinationals.  ","(i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. It should be kept in mind that always same results cannot be seen even after adopting the same policy. Different effects of it can be seen in the different parts of the world. Those who criticise globalisation have raised their voices that poor countries would lead to an extent of destruction. (ii) Weakening of the state leads to a reduction in the capacity of state to protect the interest of its poor. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. They point out that it is likely to benefit only a small section of the population while impoverishing those who were dependent on the government for jobs and welfare (education, health, sanitation, etc.) (iii) In political terms, they also fear the weakening of the state, economically they want a return to self-reliance and protectionism, at least in certain areas of the economy. Culturally, they are worried that traditional culture will be harmed and people will loose their age-old values and ways.

Similarly, the restrictions on movement of capital across countries have also been reduced. (iii) Globalisation has led to the flow of ideas across national boundaries; spread of internet and computer related services is an example of that. (iv) Economic globalisation has created an intense division of opinion all over the world. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. (v) Globalisation generates greater economic growth and well being for larger sections of the population when there is deregulation. Greater trade among countries allows each economy to do what it does best. Q.5. How has globalisation affected India and what has been India’s response?

Flow or exchange can take various forms: Commodities, Capital, people and ideas, Globalisation has involved greater trade in commodities across the globe; the restrictions imposed by different countries on allowing the imports of other countries have been reduced. The restrictions on movement of capital across countries have also been reduced. In operational terms, it means that investors in the rich countries can invest their money in countries other than their own, including developing countries, where they might get better return. Globalisation has also led to the flow of ideas across national boundaries. The spread of internet and computer related services is an example of that. Consequences of globalisation are not the same in every country. They may vary. Economic globalisation has created an intense division of opinion all over the world. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. They point out that it is likely to benefit only a small section of the population while impoverishing those who were dependent on the government for job and welfare (education, health, sanitation, etc.) They have emphasised the need to ensure institutional safeguards or creating ‘social safety nets’ to minimise the negative effects of globalisation on those who are economically weak. Advocates of economic globalisation argue that it generates greater economic growth and well-being for larger section of the population when there is de-regulation. They also advocate that economic globalisation is inevitable and it is not wise to resist the march of history. More moderate supporters of globalisation says that globalisation provide a challenge that can be responded to intelligently without accepting it uncritically. Interdependence and integration between governments, business and ordinary people in different parts of the world has increased as a result of globalisation. In 1991, responding to a financial crisis and to the desire for higher rates of economic growth, India embarked on a programme of economic reforms that has sought increasingly to deregulate various sectors including trade and foreign investment. It is not possible to say how good this has been for India, the ultimate test is not high growth rates as making sure that the benefits of growth are shared so that everyone is better off. Q.15. Do you agree with the argument that globalisation leads to cultural heterogeneity? [NCERT] Ans. Yes. Globalisation influence our culture upto an extent. Globalisation affect us in our home, in our home, in what we eat, drink, wear and indeed in what we think. Globalisation leads to the rise of a uniform culture or what is called homogenisation. The rise of a uniform culture is not the evolution of a global culture. This is imposition of Western culture on the rest of the world. US hegemony can be seen on different cultures. The popularity of a burger or blue jeans, some argue, has a lot to do with the powerful effect of the American way of life. Thus, the culture of the politically and economically dominant society leaves its imprint on a less powerful society, and the
 world begins to look more like the dominant power wishes is to be. McDonaldisation of the world is a clear example of increasing effect of American culture. Culture is a dynamic concept. All culture accept outside influences all the time. These changes simple enlarge our choices, and sometimes they modify our culture without overwhelming the traditional. The Burger is added on to our food choices. In the same way Blue jeans can go well with the homespun khadi kurti. The outcome of outside influence is a new combination that is unique, a Khadi kurta worn over jeans, interestingly this clothing combination has been exported back to the country that gave us blue jeans so that it is possible to see young Americans wearing a Kurta and jeans. While cultural globalisation is a facet of globalisation, the same process also generate precisely the opposite effect. It leads to each culture becoming more different and distinctive. This phenomenon is called cultural heterogenisation. This is not to deny that there remain differences in power when cultures interact but instead more fundamentally to suggest that cultural exchange is rarely one way. Q.16. Explain any four consequences of globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. (i) Political: Globalisation affect ‘traditional conceptions of state sovereignty’. It result in an erosion of state capacity, that is, the ability of government to do what they do. It encourages more minimalist states in place of welfare state. Now they perform only two core functions of maintenance of law and under and the security of its citizen from foreign attack. However it withdraws from many of its earlier welfare functions directed at economic and social well being. (ii) Economic: Economic concept of world is a part of chain of globalisation. Economic gloabalisation play a very important role in the world’s politics. Economic globalisation involve many international institutions like World Bank and International monetary fund. Both of these institutions play a very important role in determining economic policies across the world. Yet, globalisation must not be viewed in such narrow turns. Economic globalisation involves many factors other than these international institutions. (iii) Cultural: The consequences of globalisation are not confined only to the sphere of politics and economy. Globalisation affect us in our home, in what we eat, drink wear and indeed in what we think. It shapes what we think are our preferences. The cultural influence of globalisation leads to the fear that this process poses a threat to cultures in world. It does so, because globalisation leads to the rise of a uniform culture or what is called ‘cultural homogenisation’. The rise of a uniform culture is not the evolution of a global culture. Thus, global culture is the imposition of western culture on the rest of the world. The popularity of burger or blue jeans has a lot to do with the powerful influence of the American way of life. (iv) Economic: Globalisation encourages different opinion all through the world. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. They point out that it is likely to benefit
 only a small section of the population while impoverishing those who were dependent on the government for job and welfare (education, health, sanitation, etc.) They have called for a halt to force economic globalisation, for the poor within these countries. This would mark re-colonisation of the world. Q.17. “Sovereignty has come in the hands of global consumers rather than nation state because of globalisation.” Explain the statement. [CBSE (AI) 2012] Ans. Those on the left argue that ‘sovereignty has come in the hands of global consumers rather than nation state because of globalisation’. The statement can be explained by the following ways: i. Globalisation has influenced the role of state in developing countries. In clear words, globalisation limits the strength or capability of state or government. The ideology of welfare state has been faded and it has given way to more minimalist states. ii. The state now limits itself to core functions such as the maintenance of law and order and the security of its citizens. However, it withdraws from many of its earlier welfare functions directed at economic and social well-being. In place of the welfare state, it is the market that becomes prime determinant of economic and social priorities. iii. The entry and the increased role of multinational companies all over the world leads to a reduction in the capacity of governments to take decisions as their own. iv. Globalisation has also led to the flow of ideas across national boundaries. The spread of internet and computer related services is an example of that. v. Government is lacking behind in some of its responsibilities due to globalisation. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. vi. The culture of the politically and economically dominant society leaves its imprint on a less powerful society and the world begins to look more like the dominant power it wishes to be. Q.18. Explain the positive impacts of globalisation on the present day world. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. Positive impacts of Globalisation on the present day world. (i) It has increased the opportunities for employment to a large number of people in the world. (ii) It has provided an opportunities for the flow of ideas moving from one part of the world to another. (iii) Capital can soon be transferred to any part of the world to the people in need.
 differences in power when cultures interact but instead more fundamentally to suggest that cultural exchange is rarely one way. Q.7. What are the arguments given by the supporters of economic globalisation? Ans. Supporters of economic globalisation believe that it enhances prosperity and ‘openness’, promotes happiness among public. It enables a country to perform better after its trade being promoted. This benefits the whole world. Advocates of globalisation say that economic globalisation is necessary and resisting the march of history is not a good idea. Q.8. What are the reasons for the promotion in trade of goods in world by globalisation? Ans. 1. Reduction in restriction imposed on imports by various countries. 2. Reduction in restriction on entry and exit of Capital. Q.9. What are the reasons for Globalisation resistance? Ans. Following are the reasons for Globalisation resistance: 1. Globalisation make rich richer and poor poorer. 2. Traditional culture will be harmed and people will loose their age-old values and ways. Q.10. What is World Social Forum? What are its objectives? [CBSE (AI) 2009] Ans. World Social Forum is a global platform, which brings together a wide coalition composed of human right activists, environmentalists, labours, youth and women activists. Their main objective is to oppose neo-liberal globalisation. Q.11. How have different social and pressure groups resisted against globalisation in India? [CBSE Sample paper 2016] Ans. (a) Resistance to Globalisation has come from different sections and divisions of the society. There have been left wing protests to economic liberalisation, voiced through political parties as well as through forums like The Indian social Forum. (b) Trade unions of industrial work force as well those representing farmer interests have organised protests against the entry of multinationals.

[CBSE Delhi 2012, 2013; (AI) 2014] Ans. (i) End of the Cold War: Disintegration of Soviet Union led to end of the Cold War confrontations. The ideological dispute over, whether the socialist system would beat the capitalist system was not an issue anymore. (ii) End of Massive Arms Race: Cold War with Ideological dispute had engaged the military of two blocs, had triggered a massive arms race and accumulation of nuclear weapons, and had led to the existence of military blocs. The end of the confrontation brought a ray of hope to that there will be an end to this arms race and peace would be established. (iii) Unipolar System: The possibility of disintegration of Soviet Union was expressed as either unipolar international politics with the domination of remaining one superpower on the rapidly changing international stage or European Union, SAARC, ASEAN, etc., could become important players in the international system,thereby bringing in a multipolar system where no one power could dominate. As it turned out, the US became the sole superpower.

 Q.7. What do you mean by US hegemony in today’s world? Which two constraints control US hegemony? [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. US hegemony in today’s world politics means dominance of US at global stage. After the Collapse of bipolar world, US has emerged as a sole superpower and unipolar system is established in the world. US hegemony can be seen as hard power, structural power and soft power. It can interfere in any part of the world in its economy and military affairs. There are two constraints on American power: 1. The system of division of American powers among three parts. 2. NATO-NATO is the only organization in International system that could possibly moderate the exercise of American Power today. Q.8. What are the constraints on American hegemony today? Which of these do you expect to get more importance in the future? [NCERT] Or Mention any two constraints that come in the wars of American hegemony. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. History tells us that empires decline because they decay from within. Similarly the biggest constraints to American hegemony lie within the heart of hegemony itself. Although, none of these constraints seemed to operate in the years following 9/11, but it now appears that all three of these constraints are slowly beginning to operate again. These are as follows: (i) Institutional Architecture of America: The first constraint is the institutional architecture of America itself. A system of division of powers between the three branches of the government, places significant breaks upon the unrestrained and immoderate exercise of America’s military power of the executive branch. This isthe best example of constraints on American hegemony today. (ii) Domestic Nature of American Power: The second constraint on American hegemony is internal and domestic nature of American power. Although the American mass media may from time to time impose or promote a particular perspective on domestic public opinion in the US, there is nevertheless a deep skepticism regarding the purposes and methods of government in American political culture. This factor is a huge constraint on US military action overseas. (iii) North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO): NATO is the third most important factor that imposes a constraint on American power in global politics. Clearly, the US
 has an enormous interest in keeping the alliance of democracies that follow the market economies alive and therefore it is possible that its allies in the NATO will be able to moderate the exercise of US hegemony. Q.9. Describe US hegemony as a soft power. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Or ‘US’s hegemony as a soft power cannot be denied.’ Comment. Ans. After the Second World War, America’s cultural superiority along with military and soft power dominance can also be seen. Here, hegemony implies class ascendancy in the social, political and particularly ideological spheres. Hegemony arises when the dominant country can win the consent of dominated classes, by persuading the dominated classes to view the world in a manner favourable to the ascendancy of the dominant class. A dominant power deploys notonly military power but also ideological resources to shape the behavior of competing and lesser powers. Consent, in other words, goes hand-in-hand with, and often more effective than, coercion. The predominance of the US in the world today is based not only on its military power and economic powers, but also on its cultural presence. India’s example can justify this. It is the dream of every literate Indian that he/she wants to go settle in US by any means because they feel their future is secured in US. India is adopting culture, living sense of US. US has been benefitted by this reaction is expanding its dominance. Even during the Cold War, the society of Soviet Union was very much impressed by the improvised of US. The youth of Soviet Union was most impressed by wearing the popular blue jeans. As a result, they used to feel satisfied after purchasing blue jeans from market ever if they spend their yearly income. These blue jeans were not available in their own country. During the Cold War, the US found it difficult to score victories against the Soviet Union in the realm of hard power. It was in the area of structural power and soft power that the US scored notable victories. The interest of citizens of Soviet Union in blue jeans clearly shows this. The US culture is very attractive and is most powerful. It is that aspect of soft power where the country wins the consent of dominated classes.

Bush the elections of First Gulf War lost the presidency elections held in 1992 by Bill Clinton, leader of democratic party. Bill Clinton won in 1996 also and ruled for eight years. He campaigned on domestic rather than foreign policy issues. It often seemed that the US had withdrawn into the internal affairs and was not withdrawn into the internal affairs and was not engaged in world politics. In foreign policy, the Clinton government tended to focus on ‘Soft issues’ like democracy promotion, climate change and world trade rather than on the ‘hard politics of military power and security.

Give classic example of America as a structural power. Ans. A classic example of the structural power, of the US in the academic degree called the Masters in Business Administration (MBA). The idea that business is a profession that depends upon skills that can be taught in a university is uniquely American.

The attacks have come to be known as ‘9/11’. Q.10. What do you mean by Bandwagon strategy? [CBSE (Comptt.) 2014]
 Ans. Instead of engaging in activities opposed to the hegemonic power, it may be advisable to extract benefits by operating within the hegemonic system. This is called the ‘bandwagon’ strategy. In other words benefitting itself by being under the hegemony of America instead of fighting against it. Q.11. What do you mean by ‘Operation Enduring Freedom’? [CBSE Delhi 2013, (AI) 2014] Ans. Al-Qaeda and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan were held responsible for 9/11 attack in US. The US launched ‘Operation Enduring Freedom’ against terrorism. American President George Bush announced the objective of ‘Global War on Terror’ as a means to eliminate terrorists’ groups spread in the world. Q.12. Write the objectives of Iraq invasion by US. Ans. Iraq had surplus oilfields. US wanted to gain a control over Iraq’s oilfields. Although, US has 40 percent oil resources, but it still wanted to maintain its hegemony on oil resources of Iraq and other oil-producing countries. US wanted to increase its hegemony in the world and wanted to install a regime friendly to the US so that it could establish a friendly relations with Kuwait and other Gulf and Oil-producing countries.
 Salaam, Tanzania were bombed in 1998. These bombings were attributed to Al-Qaeda, a terrorist organization strongly influenced by extremist Islamist ideas. President Clinton ordered ‘Operation Infinite Reach’, a series of cruise missile strikes on Al-Qaeda terrorists, targets in Sudan and Afghanistan. The US did not bother about the UN sanction or provisions of international law in this regard. Q.4. When and why was ‘Operation Enduring Freedom’ launched? [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. As a part of its ‘Global War on Terror’, US launched ‘Operation Enduring Freedom’ in 2001 against all those suspected to be behind 9/11 attack, mainly Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Bush, the US President, clearly declared that the overall objective of the ‘Global War on Terror’ was not only to disrupt Al-Qaeda network worldwide but also to prevent all danger from terrorists teaming with a small groups of nations seeking to develop nuclear and biological weapons. The Taliban regime was overthrown easily. The US forces have made arrests throughout the world. Sometimes these arrests have been without the knowledge of the governments of their home countries. Q.5. Give a brief description of Iraq War. Ans. US, in regard to destruction of 9/11, concentrated on Iraq after defeating Afghanistan. The news was spreaded in the world that Iraq’s President has an illegal collection of weapons of mass destruction. So, it has become necessary to prevent Iraq from developing weapons of mass destruction. More than 40 other countries joined and was named as ‘coalition of the willing’. On 19 March 2003, the US launched its invasion of Iraq under the codename ‘operation Iraqi freedom’. Even UN’s permission was not taken for this invasion. The government of Saddam Hussein fell swiftly. Since no evidence of WMD has been unearthed in Iraq, it is speculated that the invasion was motivated by other objectives, such as controlling Iraqi oilfields and installing a regime friendly to the US. Even after winning, US has not been able to ‘pacify’ Iraq. Instead, a full-fledged insurgencies against US Occupation was ignited in Iraq. While the US has lost over 3,000 military personnel in the war, Iraqi casualties are very much higher. 50,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed in the US-led invasion. Q.6. Write a short note on ‘First Gulf War’. Ans. The ‘First Gulf War’ revealed the vast technological gap that had opened up between the US military capability and that of other states. The highly publicised use of socalled ‘smart bombs’ by the US led observers to call this a ‘computer war’. Widespread television coverage also made it as ‘video game war’, with viewers around the worldwatching the destruction of Iraqi forces live on TV in the comfort of their living rooms. Incredibly, the US may actually have made a profit from the war. The US received more money from countries like Germany, Japan and Saudi Arabia that it had spent on the war.

","the adversary while its forces are sheltered to the maximum extent possible from the dangers of war. The absolute capabilities of the US is the fact that no other power today can remotely match them. The US today spends more on its military capability than the next 12 powers combined. Although, the US invasion of Iraq reveals several American vulnerabilities. The US has not been able to force the Iraqi people into submitting to the occupation forces of the US-led coalition. Imperial powers through history have used military forces to accomplish four tasks: to conquer, deter, punish and police. US has been able to succeed in first three tasks. It has won Iraq and has restricted Iraqi powers. Punishment of death to President Hussain and his supporters was given but US military capability has thus far been shown to have serious weaknesses in policing an occupied territory. Q.6. Describe US hegemony as a structural power. Ans. In the world politics, economic power also plays an important role with hard power. It raises political dominance of the country as well. This is known as structural power. The basic idea is that an open world economy requires a hegemony or dominant power to support its creation and existence. The hegemony must possess both the ability and the desire to establish certain norms for order and must sustain the global structure. The hegemony usually does this to its own advantage but often its relative detriment, as its competitors take advantage of the openness of the world economy without paying the costs of maintaining its openness. Hegemony is reflected in the role played by the US in providing global public goods. Public goods are those goods that can be consumed by one person without reducing the goods available for someone else. Fresh air and roads are examples of public goods. In the context of world economies, the best examples of a global public goods are sea-lines of communication, (SLOCs), the sea routes were commonly used by merchant ships. Free trade in an open world economy would not be possible without open SLOCs. Naval power of hegemony underwrites the law of the sea and ensures freedom of navigation in international waters. Since the decline of British naval power after the Second World War, the multi-oceanic US navy has played this role. Another example of a global public good is the Internet. It is the direct outcome of a US military research project, making the virtual world of the World Wide Web possible. US is present in all the sectors of the World economy and in all areas of technology. The US share of the world economy is 28 per cent. The US also accounts for 15 percent of World trade. The Bretton woods system, set up by the US after the Second World War still constitute the basic structure of the world economy. We can regard the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Trade Organisation (WTO) as the products of American hegemony. A classic example of the structural power of the US is the academic degree called Masters in Business Administration (MBA). The idea that business is a profession that depends upon skills that can be taught in a university is uniquely American. The first business school in the world, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, was established in 1881. The first MBA courses were initiated around 1900.

According to the structure of political democratic structure of Pakistan from 1988 to 1999, Benezir Bhutto’s government centered around Pakistan People’s Party and Muslim league of Nawaz Sharif. In starting of 1999, military under leadership of General Parvez Musharraf overthrew government of Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister of Pakistan and was dismissed from Pakistan. General Musharraf got himself elected as the President. Announcement of emergency in Pakistan was done in the last months of 2006.

Even after sharing a same history, why roots of democracy could not be strengthened in Pakistan as they are in India? [CBSE (AI) 2011] Ans. The reasons behind unstable democracy in Pakistan are as follows: (i) The social dominance of the military, clergy and landowning aristocracy has led to the frequent overthrow of elected governments and the establishment of military government. Pakistan’s conflict with India has made the pro-military groups more powerful. These groups have often said that political parties and democracy inPakistan are flawed, that Pakistan’s security would be harmed by selfish-minded parties and chaotic democracy, and that army’s stay in power, is therefore, justified. While democracy has not been fully successful in Pakistan, there has been a strong prodemocracy sentiment in the country. (ii) Pakistan has a courageous and relatively free press and a strong human rights movement. The lack of genuine international support for its democratic rule in Pakistan has further encouraged the military to continue its dominance. The United States and other western countries have encouraged the military’s authoritarian rule in the past, for their own reasons. Given the fact that the threat of what they call as ‘Global Islamic Terrorism’ and the apprehension that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal might fall into the hands of these terrorist groups, the military regime in Pakistan has been seen as the protector of Western interests in West Asia and South Asia.

The Maldives successfully organised the 5th SAARC summit in its capital, Male’ in 1990. India is Supporting the Maldives in its plans. It has given Indira Gandhi
 monarch and the ruling elite. This led to a violent conflict between the Maoist guerrillas and the armed forces of the king. For some time, there was a triangular conflict among the Monarchist forces, the democrats and the Maoists. In 2002, the king abolished the parliament and dismissed the government. King of Nepal, Virendra was assasinated and Gyanendra, brother of Virendra became king of Nepal. He also adopted the policy of suppression of democracy and Maoists. This led to a massive, country wide, prodemocracy protests in April 2002. As a result, the king was forced to restore the House of Representatives that had been dissolved inApril 2002. The largely non-violent movement was led by the Seven Party Alliance (SPA), the Maoists and the social activists. Monarchy has sacrificed all its rights. Nepal is considered as a secural country. A constitutional assembly has been formed for new constitution of Nepal. Nepal is a democratic country now. India has got Nepal as a democratic partner with increase in aspirations. Q.18. Countries of South Asia do not trust each other. This region is unable to exert its influence at international level. Justify this statement and suggest measures to strengthen South Asia. Ans. The statement is totally justified that SAARC is an association of countries of South Asia but is not able to carry out work as an effective organisation due to mutual differences between these countries. They do not trust each other, especially suspicious towards India. Following are the two examples to justify the statement: 1. India-Pakistan are powerful countries of SAARC. Both countries are involved in various conflicts and differences after division and hence, they do not trust each other. Pakistan has held hand of America against India. Two wars have been done between both the countries. The Indian government blamed Pakistan for terrorism and Pakistan government hold India responsible for increasing unstability and unrest. America and China get chance to interfere due to these differences and struggle. 2. There are tensions between India and Sri Lanka. The settlement of Indian Tamils in Sri Lanka is the main reason behind the tensions.

"Before 1971, explain any two reasons which led to a war between East Pakistan (Present Bangladesh) and West Pakistan. ","(i) After partition, eastern part of Bengal from Pakistan became a part of East Pakistan. There was a distance of 1,200 miles between both regions of Pakistan. Pakistan’s government didn’t pay attention to this region and Urdu language was imposed on them. (ii) Sheikh Mujibur Rahman could not become Prime Minister even after gaining majority (160 seats out of 300 seats were won by him) in the elections.","the Awami league led by Shiekh Mujib won all seats in East Pakistan and secured majority in the proposed constituent assembly for the whole of Pakistan. But the government dominated by the West Pakistan refused to convene the assembly. 4. Shiekh Mujib was arrested and under the military rule of General Yahya Khan, the Pakistani army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. This led to a large scale migration into India, creating huge refugee problem for India. 5. The government of India supported the demands of the people of east Pakistan for their Independence and helped them financially and militarily. 6. This resulted in a war between India and Pakistan in December 1971 that ended in the formation of Bangladesh as an independent nation. Q.9. Give a description of India-Sri Lanka relationship by describing ethnic conflicts of Sri Lanka. Ans. Sri Lanka is a small island located at South of India. Like India, Sri Lanka has successfully operated a democratic system since their independence from the British. But lives of the citizens have become bothersome due to ethnic conflicts. Sri Lanka has majority of Sri Lankan natives called ‘Sinhalas’. But a large number of Tamils, who had migrated from India to Sri Lanka are also settled there. They live mainly at Northeastern parts of Sri Lanka. The migration continued even after the independence. Majority of country, i.e., Sinhalas do not like Tamils living in Sri Lanka. They believe that Sri Lanka belongs to Sinhalas only. In 1964, ‘Shastri-Sinimavo Bandaranaike agreement’ was signed to solve the problem concerning Indian Tamils but that couldn’t be implemented properly.After some years, left wing extremists revolted against government in Sri Lanka and government was busy in suppressing them. The neglect and hatred of Tamil by Sinhalas led to fights. Violent fights took place between both communities in 1983. Sri Lankan army suppressed Tamils heartlessly. A serious reaction was seen on Tamilians. The ‘Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam’ (LTTE) was formed and demanded ‘Tamil Eelam’ or a separate country for the Tamils of SriLanka. Firing by aeroplanes in order to destroy Tamil’s military base by Sri Lankan government further worsened the situation. Pressure was put on Tamil Nadu government by Tamils to take measures in the direction of saving their interests and security. The difficulties in the relationship between the governments of India and Sri Lanka are mostly over ethnic conflict in the island nation. Indian leaders and citizens find it impossible to remain neutral when Tamils are politically unhappy and are being killed. After the military intervention in 1987, the Indian government now prefers a policy of disengagement visà-vis Sri Lanka’s internal troubles. India signed a free trade agreement with Sri Lanka, which strengthened relations between two-countries. India’s help in post-tsunami reconstruction in Sri Lanka has also brought the two countries closer. Q.10. Describe important issues or struggles held between India and Pakistan. Ans. Following struggles have taken place between India and Pakistan:
 1. Country division and Violence: At the time of division of country, it was expected that demands of Mulsim league related to Pakistan would be met and peace would be established between both the countries. But this did not happen. Hindus and Sikhs bearing hair were pushed to India from Pakistan. Property of billions weredestroyed. Crores were displaced. Modesty of mothers and sisters was destroyed. Its reaction was seen in India as well and Muslims left India and settled Pakistan. 2. Attack on Kashmir: Pakistan occupied 2/5 part of the Kashmir by attacking India’s undivided Jammu-Kashmir in 1947. As India believes in the peace policy, the matter was raised in UNO by India. But Pakistan didn’t follow orders of security council. On the other side, India, during the war of 1965 and 1971, released Pakistani regions such as Kashmir, Punjab and Sindh on the basis of Line of Control of 1948 in Jammu and Kashmir. But still, no cooperation could be seen from Pakistan’s side. Pakistan is hostile to India. It takes help of separatists of Jammu-Kashmir and Punjab. Pakistani terrorists have come to Jammu-Kashmir and an undeclared war against India could be sensed. 3. Attack on Kutchh: In January 1965, Pakistan attacked Rann of Kutchh, region of Gujarat, India. War came to an end between both the countries in June 1965 due to international pressures. The matter was given to international judgement for final decision. The problem was thus resolved. 4. Indo-Pakistan War: On September 1965, Pakistan attacked Indian region, Kashmir. Indian army gave a befitted reply to Pakistan. 740 square miles instead of 240 square miles of India was occupied. Pakistan agreed to end the war due to international pressure and internal weeknesses. As per the Tashkent agreement done with the help of Soviet Union, both the countries got ready to station their armies on the boundaries before war could start. In the end of 1971, Pakistan again attacked India but Pakistan had to pay for that. Its eastern alliance Bengal was no longer a part of Pakistan and it emerged as an independent country called ‘Bangladesh’. It was badly defeated by Western alliance and war ceased due to international interference. After the formation of BJP government in March 1998, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee tried to maintain better political relationship with Pakistan. Lahore Bus visit was done by him in February 1999 had this objective. But after some time, Pakistan attacked Kargil area of Jammu-Kashmir in May 1999. Indian army showed bravery, freed each inch of land of India from the enemy. Pakistan had a setback at its political front and was isolated at international front. Pakistan was suspended from the Commonwealth Organisation (Councils of Commonwealth) because of the unconstitutional overthrow of the democratically elected government of Pakistan as a serious violation of the commonwealth’s fundamental political principles (1999). The United States has withheld $50 million remaining in military reimbursements to Pakistan for fiscal year 2016 because it believes that Islamabad has not done enough to blunt the Islamist militant Haqqani network. Indo-Pak relations continue to be stressful from the time of kargil war. All are aware of the fact that Pakistani terrorists are responsible for destructive activities
 in Jammu-Kashmir, India. As a result, relationships have become stressful and mutual discussions between the two countries have stopped. Q.11. Write about Pakistan’s changing relationship with India. [CBSE Delhi 2011] Ans. Indo-Pak changing relationship can be understood by the following points: 1. Pakistan attacked India in 1965 and India too gave a befitting reply. An agreement was signed by both of them in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, with the help of Soviet Union. As a result, Pakistan states, which were won by India, returned back to Pakistan. 2. In 1971, a war between India and Pakistan again took place concerning Bangladesh. Pakistan was badly defeated by India. In addition to this, East Pakistan broke away to emerge as an independent country called ‘Bangladesh’. Prime Ministers of both the countries (India and Pakistan) met at Shimla. A treaty called ‘Shimla Pact’ was signed by them. According to this, both the countries agreed to find solutions to the major problems peacefully. 3. Ministers and officials of India and Pakistan visited each others country in 1985. Agreements to improve agriculture, science and technology and trade were signed. Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi met Pakistani President, General Zia several times. But no solid outcome was observed. Ms. Benezir Bhutto became Prime Minister ofPakistan in 1988. It was expected that relationship between both the countries would become cordial due to democracy, but this didn’t happen. The behaviour opted by Prime Minister of Pakistan, Sh. Nawaz Sharif towards India brought bitterness in Indo-Pak relations. 4. Indo-Pak relations have become better from time to time but promotion to terrorism and separatists in India by Pakistan have made their relations bitter. Hence, no solution has been found out so far. Q.12. Describe common problems of South Asian countries. [CBSE (AI) 2011] Ans. 1. Some member countries of SAARC think that SAFTA is a way for India to ‘Invade’ the markets and to influence their societies and politics through commercial ventures and a commercial presence in their countries. On the other hand, India thinks that there are real economic benefits for all from SAFTA and that a region that trades more freely will be able to cooperate better on political issues. 2. SAARC countries have many internal conflicts. Conflicts over issues such as distribution of river waters and boundaries always continue to remain. India is worried of Pakistan’s initiated terrorism whereas Pakistan has differences with India over on the issue of Kashmir. SAARC has not been able to achieve success properlyas they shake hands but are not unified by their hearts.

How was ‘Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam’ formalised?,"The neglect of Tamil, concerns by Sinhala community of Sri Lanka led to militant Tamil nationalism. Tamils who had migrated from India were treated badly by Sri Lankan government. As a result, ‘Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam’ (LTTE) was formed and started demanding ‘Tamil Eelam’ or a separate country for the Tamils of Sri Lanka.","the Awami league led by Shiekh Mujib won all seats in East Pakistan and secured majority in the proposed constituent assembly for the whole of Pakistan. But the government dominated by the West Pakistan refused to convene the assembly. 4. Shiekh Mujib was arrested and under the military rule of General Yahya Khan, the Pakistani army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. This led to a large scale migration into India, creating huge refugee problem for India. 5. The government of India supported the demands of the people of east Pakistan for their Independence and helped them financially and militarily. 6. This resulted in a war between India and Pakistan in December 1971 that ended in the formation of Bangladesh as an independent nation. Q.9. Give a description of India-Sri Lanka relationship by describing ethnic conflicts of Sri Lanka. Ans. Sri Lanka is a small island located at South of India. Like India, Sri Lanka has successfully operated a democratic system since their independence from the British. But lives of the citizens have become bothersome due to ethnic conflicts. Sri Lanka has majority of Sri Lankan natives called ‘Sinhalas’. But a large number of Tamils, who had migrated from India to Sri Lanka are also settled there. They live mainly at Northeastern parts of Sri Lanka. The migration continued even after the independence. Majority of country, i.e., Sinhalas do not like Tamils living in Sri Lanka. They believe that Sri Lanka belongs to Sinhalas only. In 1964, ‘Shastri-Sinimavo Bandaranaike agreement’ was signed to solve the problem concerning Indian Tamils but that couldn’t be implemented properly.After some years, left wing extremists revolted against government in Sri Lanka and government was busy in suppressing them. The neglect and hatred of Tamil by Sinhalas led to fights. Violent fights took place between both communities in 1983. Sri Lankan army suppressed Tamils heartlessly. A serious reaction was seen on Tamilians. The ‘Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam’ (LTTE) was formed and demanded ‘Tamil Eelam’ or a separate country for the Tamils of SriLanka. Firing by aeroplanes in order to destroy Tamil’s military base by Sri Lankan government further worsened the situation. Pressure was put on Tamil Nadu government by Tamils to take measures in the direction of saving their interests and security. The difficulties in the relationship between the governments of India and Sri Lanka are mostly over ethnic conflict in the island nation. Indian leaders and citizens find it impossible to remain neutral when Tamils are politically unhappy and are being killed. After the military intervention in 1987, the Indian government now prefers a policy of disengagement visà-vis Sri Lanka’s internal troubles. India signed a free trade agreement with Sri Lanka, which strengthened relations between two-countries.

India has allowed trading of the products made by other countries of South Asia without paying any trade tariffs. This was announced in SAARC summit organised at Delhi on April 2007. India thinks that free trade across the borders of countries of South Asia would increase trade relations (according to SAFTA) and formation of a free trade zone would increase political cooperation. India has bilateral agreements with Nepal and Sri Lanka. Q.9. What were the challenges faced by Sri Lanka after independence? Ans. Sri Lanka had to face challenge from ethnic conflict after independence. Sri Lanka was dominated by the forces that represented the interest of the majority of Sinhala community. They were hostile to a large number of Tamils who had migrated from India to Sri Lanka and settled there.

The neglect of Tamil concerns led to militant Tamil nationalism for interests of culture, language and identity. Q.10. How are the external powers influencing bilateral relations in South Asia? [NCERT] Ans. South Asia has been under the influence of external powers due to its natural formation. India adopted the policy of non-alignment during the cold war but Pakistan became a member of NATO, thus affecting India-Pakistan relations and leading to conflicts and tensions. Pakistan supported terrorist activities in India with the assistance given by America. China and USA play an important role in politics of South Asia. IndiaChina relations became bitter on issues of Tibet crises and McMohan line. Chinese support to Pakistan was one of the reasons for bitterness in their relations. In recent years, India-China economic relations have improved. American coherence has been increased in this region from the end of Cold War. America has tried to maintain cordial relationship with India and Pakistan. Economic development, globalisation and
 liberalisation have increased the role of America in this region. America thinks that safety and peace is essential in the region as there is a hugepopulation and huge market in South Asia. Q.11. Why were superpowers more interested in South Asian countries during the Cold War era? How did this affect the region? Ans. South Asia is the region where lots of internal affairs and global struggles exist. American involvement in South Asia rapidly increased after the cold war because this region could provide ports against its enemies - Soviet Union and China. America looked towards India but since India became a member of non-aligned movement, it headed towards Pakistan. A series of issues arose in this region. Issues like boundary affairs and distribution of river waters have made this region unrest. The fact that the region can develop if the countries cooperate with each other was observed by citizens of these countries. Q.12. Why did India interfere in the affair of East Pakistan? Ans. After independence, people of East Pakistan resented the domination of Western Pakistan and the imposition of the Urdu language. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led the popular struggle against West Pakistani domination. They demanded autonomy for the eastern region. In 1970, national assembly elections were held in Pakistan. The Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur won all the seats in East Pakistan and secured a majority (313 out of 167) is proposed constituent assembly for the whole of Pakistan. But the government dominated by the West Pakistani leadership refused to convene the assembly. Sheikh Mujibur was arrested. Under the military rule of General YahyaKhan, the Pakistan army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. Thousands were killed by the Pakistani army. This led to a large scale migration into India, creating a huge refugee problem for India. The government of India supported the demand of the people of East Pakistan for independence and helped them financially and militarily. This resulted in a war between India and Pakistan in December 1971 that ended in the surrender of the Pakistani forces in East Pakistan and the formation of ‘Bangladesh’ as an independent country. Q.13. Why did India had to call back its army from Sri Lanka? Ans. There was a considerable pressure from Tamil people in India to effect that the Indian government should protect the interests of the Tamils in Sri Lanka. On 29 July, 1987, India signed an accord with Sri Lanka in which provincial councils in northern and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka were formed and provincial autonomy to them was given. The aim of the agreement was to save interests of Tamil and their identity by maintaining sovereignty of Sri Lanka. It was also decided that ‘Tamil Tigers’ would end the struggle and give up their weapons. But the agreement could not be implemented completely. Sri Lanka said India to sent military troops in order to establish peace in north-eastern states of country. Indian military troops tried to establish peace in Sri Lanka with the help of Sri Lankan government. Eventually, the Indian army got into a
 fight with LTTE. Shri Premdas became Presidentof Sri Lanka. He was completely against the presence of Indian army in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan citizens saw this as an India’s attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka. Indian Tamils were also unhappy with the proceedings being done against them (Sri Lankan Tamilians) by India. Sri Lankan President Premdasa openly demanded India to take back its armed forces on 29 July, 1989. Uncertainty and strain continued for some time in Sri Lanka. But in December 1989, after the formation of new government, Indian Peace Keeping Force was called back from Sri Lanka on 31 March, 1990. Q.14. What steps have been taken to normalise Indo-Pak relations by Indian rulers in last two decades? Ans. Pakistan’s support to terrorism in Kashmir still continues. Despite of this, Prime Minister Gujral tried to improve bilateral relations. Prime Minister Vajpayee did Lahore Bus Tour and signed Lahore announcement letter in order to promote harmony. In return to this, kargil war was held between both the countries as an undisclosed war. Agra-talks of 2001 failed and terrorist attack on Parliament in December 2001 inspired India to end all diplomatic relations with Pakistan. Pakistan’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) is alleged to be involved in managing in Anti-Indian campaigns. Diplomatic initiatives were again started in 2003 but this was a pain staking way and both the countries were heading for friendly solution carefully. This pause was broken down by Vajpayee’s visit to Islamabad and to start cricket between both countries again. A Re-evaluation of relationship of both the countries was proposed by Manmohan Singh (former Prime Minister of India). Hindrance was seen during Mumbai bomb blast in 2006 but both countries agreed to continue discussion. SAARC summit held at New Delhi 2007 paved way for peace and friendliness in this area between both the countries. They accepted that terrorisom is a challenge in the way of peace and security. When Pakistani Prime Minister visited India in 2014, people of both the countries hoped for a fresh start and improved relations. But Pakistan’s irresponsible attitude towards terrorism cannot be trusted upon. It agrees on eliminating terrorism but does not take any initiative. Instead, it promotes terrorism. Q.15. Mention some of the recent agreements between India and Pakistan. [NCERT] Ans. Although India-Pakistan relations seem revolving around conflicts, there have been a series of efforts to manage tensions and build peace. Following are the recent agreements between them: 1. India-Pakistan held differences over distribution of Indus river waters. Indus River Treaty was signed by India and Pakistan in 1960 by mediation of World Bank. Despite of the differences, the treaty is still in effect. 2. After Indo-Pak war of 1971, Shimla pact was signed by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Indira Gandhi.

Write any two reasons for unstable democracy in Pakistan. ,"There are several reasons for unstable democracy in Pakistan. The two main reasons are as follows: (i) Social dominance of the military, clergy, and landowning aristocracy. (ii) Pakistan’s conflict with India has made the pro-military groups more powerful.","Q.1. Describe any two major issues between India and Pakistan which led to war of 1971. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. War of 1971 held because of two main reasons: (i) Refugee problem in 1971: A disintegrated Pakistan came in elections of 1970. Parties of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Sheikh Mujibur succeeded in Western and Eastern Pakistan respectively. Bengali population of eastern Pakistan voted heavily against Western Pakistan. Rulers of Western Pakistan considered citizens of eastern Pakistan as ‘another level’ citizens. Pakistan didn’t consider decision of democracy taken by eastern Pakistan valid. They also refused to convene the assembly of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Sheikh Mujibur was arrested and Pakistani army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. This led to a large scale migration into India, creating a huge refugee problem in India. The government of India supported people of east Pakistan. Consequently, India had a war with Pakistan. (ii) To support Bangladesh for its independence: In 1971, people of eastern Pakistan resented the domination of Western Pakistan and the imposition of an Urdu language. Thousands were killed by the Pakistani army which led to huge scale migration into India. India too gave them shelter. In addition to this, India support Bangladesh in its struggle for independence. Pakistan strongly opposed this step of India and attacked on its airports on 3 December, 1971. Indian army too attacked Pakistan. Pakistan lost the war which resulted in the transformation of eastern Pakistan into newly independent country ‘Bangladesh’. Q.2. ‘Pakistan has witnessed both civilian and democratic system’. Explain. Ans. Pakistan has witnessed civilian system many times despite of citizens aspiration for democracy. In last 65 years, almost 29-30 years were ruled by civilians in Pakistan from 1947 to 2012. General Ayub Khan, General Yahya, General Zia-ul-Haq and General Pervez Musharraf were among the leaders of civil-rule. The first military rule inPakistan was established under the leadership of General Ayub Khan and was succeeded in announcing constitution ruler of Pakistan through the drama of elections. But he couldn’t befool public and public outrage increased. Unstability and dissatisfaction against him was increasing in Pakistan army. General Yahya took advantage, overthrew the government and himself became the dictator. Separation of eastern part of Pakistan and Pakistan’s defeat from India banished Yahya Khan from his power and an elected government under the leadership of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto came into power. Within the period of 7 years, Bhutto government was removed by General Zia-ul-Haq by a military revolution and was hanged after sometime.Dissatisfaction
 towards military rule of General Zia-ul-Haq and democratic government under the leadership of Benezir Bhutto, daughter of Bhutto was established in Pakistan. According to the structure of political democratic structure of Pakistan from 1988 to 1999, Benezir Bhutto’s government centered around Pakistan People’s Party and Muslim league of Nawaz Sharif. In starting of 1999, military under leadership of General Parvez Musharraf overthrew government of Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister of Pakistan and was dismissed from Pakistan. General Musharraf got himself elected as the President. Announcement of emergency in Pakistan was done in the last months of 2006. Elections were planned on 8 January 2008 but were postponed due to death of Benezir Bhutto during campaigning. Recently, ordinary elections took place in Pakistan, where Pakistan Muslim League (PML) was formed and Nawaz Sharif was elected as Prime Minister. Q.3. Even after sharing a same history, why roots of democracy could not be strengthened in Pakistan as they are in India? [CBSE (AI) 2011] Ans. The reasons behind unstable democracy in Pakistan are as follows: (i) The social dominance of the military, clergy and landowning aristocracy has led to the frequent overthrow of elected governments and the establishment of military government. Pakistan’s conflict with India has made the pro-military groups more powerful. These groups have often said that political parties and democracy inPakistan are flawed, that Pakistan’s security would be harmed by selfish-minded parties and chaotic democracy, and that army’s stay in power, is therefore, justified. While democracy has not been fully successful in Pakistan, there has been a strong prodemocracy sentiment in the country. (ii) Pakistan has a courageous and relatively free press and a strong human rights movement. The lack of genuine international support for its democratic rule in Pakistan has further encouraged the military to continue its dominance. The United States and other western countries have encouraged the military’s authoritarian rule in the past, for their own reasons. Given the fact that the threat of what they call as ‘Global Islamic Terrorism’ and the apprehension that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal might fall into the hands of these terrorist groups, the military regime in Pakistan has been seen as the protector of Western interests in West Asia and South Asia. Q.4. Explain any three factors that are responsible for the failure of building a stable democratic rule in Pakistan. Ans. The factors responsible for the failure of building a stable democratic rule in Pakistanare as follows: 1. The social dominance of the military, clergy and landowning aristocracy has led to frequent overthrow of elected governments and establishment of military governments.
 Q.1. List challenges to democracy in Pakistan. [NCERT] Ans. There are several challenges to democracy in Pakistan. The social dominance of the military, clergy and landowning aristocracy has led to the frequent overthrow of elected governments and the establishment of military government. Pakistan’s conflict with India has made the pro-military groups more powerful. These groups have often said that political parties and democracy in Pakistan are flawed, that Pakistan’s security would be harmed by selfish-minded parties and chaotic democracy, and that the army’s stay in power is justified while democracy has not been completely successful in Pakistan, there has been a strong pro-democracy sentiment in the country, Pakistan has a courageous and relatively free press and a strong human rights movement. Q.2. Write any four reasons for ethnic conflicts in Sri Lanka. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. Following were the reasons for ethnic conflicts in Sri Lanka. 1. Demand of separate country for the Tamils of Sri Lanka. 2. Pressure of majority of Sinhala community on Sri Lankan Politics. 3. Majority of Sinhala community was hostile to a large number of Tamils, who had migrated from India to Sri Lanka and settled there. 4. Neglect of Tamil by Sinhalas and believing that Sri Lanka belongs to the Sinhala people only. Q.3. Who play a major role in ethnic conflicts in Sri Lanka? [NCERT] Ans. Indian natives Tamils play a major role in ethnic conflicts in Sri Lanka. Before independence, British took Tamils as workers to Sri Lanka, who settled there. The settlement of Tamils in Sri Lanka continued even after its independence too. There was a domination of Sinhala community in Sri Lanka. They thought that Sri Lanka shouldnot give ‘concessions’ to the Tamils because Sri Lanka belongs to the Sinhala people only. The neglect of Tamil concerns led to militant Tamil nationalism. From 1983 onwards, the militant organisation, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has been fighting an armed struggle with the army of Sri Lanka and demanding ‘Tamil Eelam’ or a separate country for the Tamils of Sri Lanka. The LTTE controls the northeastern parts of Sri Lanka.

What are the factors responsible for conflicts in political relations of IndoPakistan?,(i) To create situations of sudden war by continuous provoking on Kashmir issue and intrusion by Pakistan. (ii) To arise tensions by giving infuriating statements for muslims living in India. (iii) To close the Indian Commerce embassy in Karachi.  (iv) Pakistan’s possession of nuclear weapons. (v) Kargil War.,"1. Country division and Violence: At the time of division of country, it was expected that demands of Mulsim league related to Pakistan would be met and peace would be established between both the countries. But this did not happen. Hindus and Sikhs bearing hair were pushed to India from Pakistan. Property of billions weredestroyed. Crores were displaced. Modesty of mothers and sisters was destroyed. Its reaction was seen in India as well and Muslims left India and settled Pakistan. 2. Attack on Kashmir: Pakistan occupied 2/5 part of the Kashmir by attacking India’s undivided Jammu-Kashmir in 1947. As India believes in the peace policy, the matter was raised in UNO by India. But Pakistan didn’t follow orders of security council. On the other side, India, during the war of 1965 and 1971, released Pakistani regions such as Kashmir, Punjab and Sindh on the basis of Line of Control of 1948 in Jammu and Kashmir. But still, no cooperation could be seen from Pakistan’s side. Pakistan is hostile to India. It takes help of separatists of Jammu-Kashmir and Punjab. Pakistani terrorists have come to Jammu-Kashmir and an undeclared war against India could be sensed. 3. Attack on Kutchh: In January 1965, Pakistan attacked Rann of Kutchh, region of Gujarat, India. War came to an end between both the countries in June 1965 due to international pressures. The matter was given to international judgement for final decision. The problem was thus resolved. 4. Indo-Pakistan War: On September 1965, Pakistan attacked Indian region, Kashmir. Indian army gave a befitted reply to Pakistan. 740 square miles instead of 240 square miles of India was occupied. Pakistan agreed to end the war due to international pressure and internal weeknesses. As per the Tashkent agreement done with the help of Soviet Union, both the countries got ready to station their armies on the boundaries before war could start. In the end of 1971, Pakistan again attacked India but Pakistan had to pay for that. Its eastern alliance Bengal was no longer a part of Pakistan and it emerged as an independent country called ‘Bangladesh’. It was badly defeated by Western alliance and war ceased due to international interference. After the formation of BJP government in March 1998, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee tried to maintain better political relationship with Pakistan. Lahore Bus visit was done by him in February 1999 had this objective. But after some time, Pakistan attacked Kargil area of Jammu-Kashmir in May 1999. Indian army showed bravery, freed each inch of land of India from the enemy. Pakistan had a setback at its political front and was isolated at international front. Pakistan was suspended from the Commonwealth Organisation (Councils of Commonwealth) because of the unconstitutional overthrow of the democratically elected government of Pakistan as a serious violation of the commonwealth’s fundamental political principles (1999). The United States has withheld $50 million remaining in military reimbursements to Pakistan for fiscal year 2016 because it believes that Islamabad has not done enough to blunt the Islamist militant Haqqani network. Indo-Pak relations continue to be stressful from the time of kargil war. All are aware of the fact that Pakistani terrorists are responsible for destructive activities
 in Jammu-Kashmir, India. As a result, relationships have become stressful and mutual discussions between the two countries have stopped. Q.11. Write about Pakistan’s changing relationship with India. [CBSE Delhi 2011] Ans. Indo-Pak changing relationship can be understood by the following points: 1. Pakistan attacked India in 1965 and India too gave a befitting reply. An agreement was signed by both of them in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, with the help of Soviet Union. As a result, Pakistan states, which were won by India, returned back to Pakistan. 2. In 1971, a war between India and Pakistan again took place concerning Bangladesh. Pakistan was badly defeated by India. In addition to this, East Pakistan broke away to emerge as an independent country called ‘Bangladesh’. Prime Ministers of both the countries (India and Pakistan) met at Shimla. A treaty called ‘Shimla Pact’ was signed by them. According to this, both the countries agreed to find solutions to the major problems peacefully. 3. Ministers and officials of India and Pakistan visited each others country in 1985. Agreements to improve agriculture, science and technology and trade were signed. Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi met Pakistani President, General Zia several times. But no solid outcome was observed. Ms. Benezir Bhutto became Prime Minister ofPakistan in 1988. It was expected that relationship between both the countries would become cordial due to democracy, but this didn’t happen. The behaviour opted by Prime Minister of Pakistan, Sh. Nawaz Sharif towards India brought bitterness in Indo-Pak relations. 4. Indo-Pak relations have become better from time to time but promotion to terrorism and separatists in India by Pakistan have made their relations bitter. Hence, no solution has been found out so far. Q.12. Describe common problems of South Asian countries. [CBSE (AI) 2011] Ans. 1. Some member countries of SAARC think that SAFTA is a way for India to ‘Invade’ the markets and to influence their societies and politics through commercial ventures and a commercial presence in their countries. On the other hand, India thinks that there are real economic benefits for all from SAFTA and that a region that trades more freely will be able to cooperate better on political issues. 2. SAARC countries have many internal conflicts. Conflicts over issues such as distribution of river waters and boundaries always continue to remain. India is worried of Pakistan’s initiated terrorism whereas Pakistan has differences with India over on the issue of Kashmir. SAARC has not been able to achieve success properlyas they shake hands but are not unified by their hearts.

Who formed SEZ?,China.,"Q.10. ‘China and India are emerging as economic power’. Do you agree? Support your answer with any three arguments. [CBSE Delhi 2011] Ans. Yes, the above statement is true. The arguments in favour are: 1. China and India are those two countries of Asia which are powerful and rich in resources. Friendship and a sound relationship between these two countries can be a reason of worry for America. Both of these countries are capable of challenging unipolar power, US and its friendly alliances by adopting similar policies andideology on international political front. 2. The population of China and India is more than 200 crores. Such a huge population can serve as a huge market for goods made by America. These countries can provide skilled and unskilled cheap labour to western and other countries.
 3. China and India are developing countries. These are in favour of country’s economy, Free Trade Policy, liberalisation, globalisation, etc. Both countries can accelerate the speed of economic development by welcoming foreign currency investment by establishment of MNCs. 4. While taking loan from the World Bank and IMF, both the countries can control the baseless conditions of America and other powers. 5. Both the countries can develop significantly in their fields of science and technology with mutual help and efforts. Q.11. The emerging economies of China and India have great potential to challenge the unipolar world. Do you agree with the Statement? Substantiate your arguments. [NCERT] Ans. Economies of China and India are developing with a rapid pace. The emerging economies of China and India have great potential to challenge the increasing US hegemony. Both the countries share some similarities that make them capable of doing so. These are: 1. India and China are populous countries. If its population be used in right direction, then it can be a challenge for any country. Huge population can provide a large market to America where it can consume its goods. 2. China and India are developing countries. Both want to adopt the policies of economy, Free Trade Policy, liberalisation and international assistance. Countries full of resources, like America can be attracted for capital investment. 3. India and China are rich in nuclear resources and weapons. They can stop US monopoly. America would like to maintain a healthy relationship with the countries rich in arms and weapons instead of putting them under its control. 4. Both the countries can produce electricity, can resolve the problem of scarcity of water and promote other industries by channeling rivers present on boundaries. Thus, China and India should resolve their boundary conflicts. 5. India and China can provide skilled and unskilled cheap labour to America, which would be helpful in resolving the issue of unemployment and can gain foreign currency. Q.12. Identify the contentious issues between China and India. How could these be resolved for greater cooperation? Give your suggestions. [NCERT] Ans. India and China are two ancient countries and their relations are also ancient. Many priests promoted Buddhism in China and many Chinese travelled India too. Relations between both the countries were normal but some issues led to bitterness among their relations. Those issues are as follows:
 (i) Tibet Crises: After the revolution of 1949, Chinese leaders sent their troops in Tibet in 1950. India didn’t support this action but neither opposed this openly. In 1959, Dalai Lama eloped and came at India, this was considered as an act of enmity by China, which led to bitterness between China and India relations. (ii) Chinese on Indian region: After China controlled Tibet, a large portion of Arunachal in the south of NEFA and Ladakh was depicted as Chinese region. When India attracted China’s attention towards it, China tried to escape by giving an excuse that the map was formed under Chiang Kai-shek’s government. In the meanwhile, it laid a trap and roads, placed its military in those areas. India was completely unaware of China’s act because of the absence of roads that lead to these areas. (iii) Chinese attack of 1962: China and India were involved in a border conflict in 1962 over competing territorial claims principally in Arunachal Pradesh and in the Aksai Chin region of Ladakh. The conflict of 1962, in which India suffered military reverses, had long term implications for India-China relations. Due to public outrage and fearing the US interference, the war was ended but the geographical area that was captured by China during war is still under China. (iv) China supporting Pakistan: China always supported Pakistan and stood against India. It prepared a military in Kashmir region that was under Pakistan. It helped Pakistan and started revolting against India in international world. Pakistan received full assistance from China in Indo-Pak war in 1965 and 1971. It openly warned India regarding sikkim in 1971 and started calling India as ‘an attacker’. Following reforms can be suggested to improve India-China relations: 1. A new limit to resolve boundary conflicts should be proposed and no country shall cross the limit. 2. Leaders of both the countries should meet, time to time and mutual differences should be solved at verbal level. 3. India and China should promote agreements based on cultural exchanges and cooperation in science and technology. Exchange of computer related technology can be done between both the countries. 4. Both the countries should promote Free Trade Policy and should be concerned about their economic development by maintaining a sound relationship. 5. Expenses should be saved by establishing mutual peace and tranquillity. India and China should focus on common problems such as population, unemployment, poverty and backwardness by investing the expenses saved from safety budget. Q.13.

Who is being credited for initiating the ‘Open door’ policy?,Deng Xiaoping.,"Ans. In 1978, the then leader of Communist Party, Deng Xiaoping announced the ‘open door’ policy and economic reforms in China. This generated higher productivity by investments of capital and technology from abroad. The new economic policies helped the Chinese economy to break from stagnation. Privatisation of agriculture led to aremarkable rise in agricultural production and rural incomes. High personal savings in the rural economy lead to an exponential growth in rural industry. The Chinese economy, including both industry and agriculture, grew at a faster rate. The new trading laws and the creation of Special Economic Zones led to a phenomenal rise inforeign trade. Q.15.

What is Marshall Plan?,The extension of America for massive financial help for reviving Europe’s economy came to be known as Marshall Plan.,"for reviving Europe’s economy under what was called the ‘Marshall Plan’ in 1948. Western countries were made clear that they would definitely have to face a huge destruction if they continue to fight amongst themselves. The incident of monopoly of a communist government in Czechoslovakia in February 1948 made this clear. The Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) was established in 1948 to channel aid to the West European states. ‘The Council of Europe’ established in 1949, was another step forward in political cooperation. The process of economic integration of European capitalist countries proceeded step by step leading to the formation of the European Economic Community in 1957. The Collapse of the Soviet bloc put Europe on a fast track and resulted inthe establishment of the European Union in 1992. The foundation was thus laid for a common foreign and security policy, cooperation on justice and home affairs and the creation of a single currency. It has its own flag, anthem, founding date, and currency. It also has some form of a common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations. Q.3. Name the pillars and objectives of the ASEAN Community. [NCERT] Ans. Countries of South-East Asia were under pressure of colonialism before the Second World War. The colonialism was of European countries like France, Britain and Holland. These countries, even after their independence had to suffer from miseries like poverty, illiteracy, scarcity of food, economic backwardness and formation of nation. They had to suffer from the hegemony of a single superpower after the end of Cold War. Bandung summit and NAM didn’t prove successful in promoting unity in Asia and third world countries. In this condition, five countries of South-East Asia namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand by signing the Bangkok Declaration in 1967, established Association for Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN took step forward to form ASEAN community based on the following three pillars in 2003: 1. ASEAN security community: ASEAN security community was based on the conviction that outstanding territorial disputes should not escalate into armed confrontation. By 2003, ASEAN has several agreements in place by which member state promised to uphold peace, neutrality, cooperation, noninterference, and respect for national differences and sovereign rights. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), established in 1994, is an organisation that carries out coordination of security and foreign policy. 2. ASEAN Economic Community: ASEAN still remains principally an economic association. While the ASEAN region as a whole is a much smaller economy compared to the US, the EU and Japan, its economy is growing much faster than all these.

To promote regional peace and stability based on the rule of law and the principles of the ‘Charter of the United Nations’. Q.5. Explain India’s policies towards ASEAN. Ans. ASEAN is rapidly growing into a very important regional organisation. The current economic strength of ASEAN, especially its economic relevance as a trading and investment partner to the growing Asian economies such as India and China, makes this an attractive proposition. ASEAN which came into effect in 1967, held no importance inIndia’s foreign policy. But 1991, India adopted the policy of ‘Go towards East’. This has helped Asian countries like Japan, South Korea, China to expand their trade. Its trade relations have become cordial with ASEAN as well.

Pakistan’s conflict with India has made the pro-military groups more powerful. Democratic system was adopted in Bangladesh after its independence. Soon afterwards, Sheikh Mujib abolished all the parties except his own, which led to conflicts and tensions. He was assassinated in a military uprising in August 1975 and military rule was established. Democracy was again established there due to public outrage. Nepal had a constitutional monarchy but due to public revolt, democraticconstitution was given acceptance in 1990. In 2002, king Gyanendra abolished the parliament and dismissed the government.

How much trade occurred between China–India in 2006?,A trade worth 18 Arab dollar was seen between China–India in 2006.,"Q.10. ‘China and India are emerging as economic power’. Do you agree? Support your answer with any three arguments. [CBSE Delhi 2011] Ans. Yes, the above statement is true. The arguments in favour are: 1. China and India are those two countries of Asia which are powerful and rich in resources. Friendship and a sound relationship between these two countries can be a reason of worry for America. Both of these countries are capable of challenging unipolar power, US and its friendly alliances by adopting similar policies andideology on international political front. 2. The population of China and India is more than 200 crores. Such a huge population can serve as a huge market for goods made by America. These countries can provide skilled and unskilled cheap labour to western and other countries.
 3. China and India are developing countries. These are in favour of country’s economy, Free Trade Policy, liberalisation, globalisation, etc. Both countries can accelerate the speed of economic development by welcoming foreign currency investment by establishment of MNCs. 4. While taking loan from the World Bank and IMF, both the countries can control the baseless conditions of America and other powers. 5. Both the countries can develop significantly in their fields of science and technology with mutual help and efforts. Q.11. The emerging economies of China and India have great potential to challenge the unipolar world. Do you agree with the Statement? Substantiate your arguments. [NCERT] Ans. Economies of China and India are developing with a rapid pace. The emerging economies of China and India have great potential to challenge the increasing US hegemony. Both the countries share some similarities that make them capable of doing so. These are: 1. India and China are populous countries. If its population be used in right direction, then it can be a challenge for any country. Huge population can provide a large market to America where it can consume its goods. 2. China and India are developing countries. Both want to adopt the policies of economy, Free Trade Policy, liberalisation and international assistance. Countries full of resources, like America can be attracted for capital investment. 3. India and China are rich in nuclear resources and weapons. They can stop US monopoly. America would like to maintain a healthy relationship with the countries rich in arms and weapons instead of putting them under its control. 4. Both the countries can produce electricity, can resolve the problem of scarcity of water and promote other industries by channeling rivers present on boundaries. Thus, China and India should resolve their boundary conflicts. 5. India and China can provide skilled and unskilled cheap labour to America, which would be helpful in resolving the issue of unemployment and can gain foreign currency. Q.12. Identify the contentious issues between China and India. How could these be resolved for greater cooperation? Give your suggestions. [NCERT] Ans. India and China are two ancient countries and their relations are also ancient. Many priests promoted Buddhism in China and many Chinese travelled India too. Relations between both the countries were normal but some issues led to bitterness among their relations. Those issues are as follows:
 (i) Tibet Crises: After the revolution of 1949, Chinese leaders sent their troops in Tibet in 1950. India didn’t support this action but neither opposed this openly. In 1959, Dalai Lama eloped and came at India, this was considered as an act of enmity by China, which led to bitterness between China and India relations. (ii) Chinese on Indian region: After China controlled Tibet, a large portion of Arunachal in the south of NEFA and Ladakh was depicted as Chinese region. When India attracted China’s attention towards it, China tried to escape by giving an excuse that the map was formed under Chiang Kai-shek’s government. In the meanwhile, it laid a trap and roads, placed its military in those areas. India was completely unaware of China’s act because of the absence of roads that lead to these areas. (iii) Chinese attack of 1962: China and India were involved in a border conflict in 1962 over competing territorial claims principally in Arunachal Pradesh and in the Aksai Chin region of Ladakh. The conflict of 1962, in which India suffered military reverses, had long term implications for India-China relations. Due to public outrage and fearing the US interference, the war was ended but the geographical area that was captured by China during war is still under China. (iv) China supporting Pakistan: China always supported Pakistan and stood against India. It prepared a military in Kashmir region that was under Pakistan. It helped Pakistan and started revolting against India in international world. Pakistan received full assistance from China in Indo-Pak war in 1965 and 1971. It openly warned India regarding sikkim in 1971 and started calling India as ‘an attacker’. Following reforms can be suggested to improve India-China relations: 1. A new limit to resolve boundary conflicts should be proposed and no country shall cross the limit. 2. Leaders of both the countries should meet, time to time and mutual differences should be solved at verbal level. 3. India and China should promote agreements based on cultural exchanges and cooperation in science and technology. Exchange of computer related technology can be done between both the countries. 4. Both the countries should promote Free Trade Policy and should be concerned about their economic development by maintaining a sound relationship. 5. Expenses should be saved by establishing mutual peace and tranquillity. India and China should focus on common problems such as population, unemployment, poverty and backwardness by investing the expenses saved from safety budget. Q.13.

What kind of concept is globalisation?,Globalisation is a multidimensional concept.,"Q.1 What is globalisation? Enlighten any three reasons for globalisation. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Or Define globalisation. Explain any three reasons for globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Globalisation means globalise the social relationship in such a way that events taking place in some parts of the world could have an impact on another part of the world. Thus, globalisation is a process in which whole earth became a global village, in which socio-economic contact is based on mutual cooperation. Main reasons for Globalisation are as follows: 1. Revolution in Communication Technique: Technology remains a critical element. There is no doubt that the invention of telegraph, the telephone, and the microchip in more recent times has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. When printing initially came into being, it laid the basis for the creation of nationalism. Technology has affected us at individual and collective levels. Technological advancements have stimulated the transfer and movement of capital, thoughts, commodities and people from one part of the world to another and that too, easily. The movement of capital and commodities has been more than the movement of peoples across different parts of the world. 2. Flow of Capital and Commodities: Economic concept of the world has to play an important role in world politics. The mention of economic globalisation draws our attention immediately to the role of international institutions like IMF and the WTO and the role they play in determining economic policies across the world. Yet globalisation must not be viewed in such narrow terms. Economic globalisation involves many factors other than these international institutions. A much broader way of understanding of economic globalisation require us to look at the distribution of economic gains, i.e., who get the most from globalisation and who gets less, indeed who loses from it. 3. Impact of an event on all the people of World: Globalisation, however, does not emerge merely because of the availability of improved communications. What is important is for people in different parts of the world is to recognise these interconnections with the rest of the world. Currently, we are aware of the fact that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on the another part of the world. The Bird Flu or Tsunami is not confined to any particular nation. It does not respect national boundaries. Similarly, when major economic events take place, their
 impact is felt outside their immediate local, national or regional environment at the international level. Q.2. What is global ‘mutual connection’? What are its components? [NCERT] Ans. Global mutual connection means the free flow of ideas, capital commodities and people from one part of the world to another. In present times, different parts of world have come close to each other. And its credit goes to the development of means of communication. The invention of telegraph, the telephone and the microchips has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. Printing connected people living at different corners of the globe. But Globalisation however does not emerge merely because of the availability of improved communications. But people in different partsof the world recognise that they are connected to each other. Currently, we are aware of the fact that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on another part of the world like Bird Flu or Tsunami. Q.3. How do technologies contribute in the direction of globalisation? Explain. [CBSE Delhi 2013, CBSE Delhi 2015] Or How has technology contributed to the globalisation? [NCERT] Ans. Revolution in Communication Technique: Technology remains a critical element.

The movement of capital and commodities has been more than the movement of peoples across different parts of the world. Q.4. Why is globalisation a multidimensional concept? Ans. Globalisation is a multidimensional concept because it cannot be limited within a certain sphere. Its effect can be seen in all the sectors like economic, political and cultural. It would be a blunder to accept globalisation only as an economic, political or a cultural event. The impact of globalisation is vastly uneven— it affects some parts more than others. Q.5. Define globalisation. Explain any one criticism for globalisation. [CBSE Delhi (C) 2014]

Define globalisation. Explain any one criticism for globalisation. [CBSE Delhi (C) 2014]
 Ans.Globalisation means globalise the social relationship in such a manner that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on another part of the world. Thus globalisation is a process in which whole earth became a global village, in which socioeconomic contact is based on mutual corporation. Apart from the sphere of economics and politics, Globalisation has affected us culturally. What we eat, drink, think and wear reflect our culture. Imposition of Western Culture on the rest of the world is leading the world to homogenous culture. It is the result of US Hegemony. Cultures seeking to buy into the dominant American dream is dangerous not only for poor countries but also for the whole of humanity, for it might lead to the shinkage of the rich cultural heritage of the entire globe. Q.6. Clarify any two positive and any two negative effects of globalisation. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. Two positive effects of globalisation are as follows: (i) As a consequence of globalisation, enhanced technologies are available with states. With these technologies, it has become easy for state to collect information about its citizens. (ii) Globalisation improves economical aspects. Economic policy of openness makes business flourish. The countries following these policies progress and prosper immensely. Negative effects of globalisation are as follows: (i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. (ii) Powerfully influenced by the American way of life, globalisation has given rise to the cultural pollution in many countries of the world. Q.7. Explain any four reasons for resistance to globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. Following are the reasons for the resistance to globalisation: (i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that make the rich richer and the poor poorer. (ii) Wea kening of the state leads to the reduction in the capacity of the state to protect the interests of its citizens, especially poor. (iii) Many countries also fear the weakening of state in political terms. Economically, they want a return to self-reliance and protectionism, at least in certain areas of the economy.
 Q.1. Define ‘Globalisation’. Ans. Globalisation is a process in which views, theories, ideologies and human values in one country affect the lives of other countries of the earth by flow and communication. Q.2. What are the types of flow there? Ans. Flow are of following types: (i) Flow of ideas from one place to another place of world, (ii) Flow of Capital for more than one year, (iii) Flow of commodity in many countries, (iv) Visit of people in different countries to earn livelihood. Q.3. List the factors responsible for globalisation. Ans. (i) Development of Technologies. (ii) Awareness among the people of different parts of the world that they all are interconnected in one way or the other. Q.4. Awareness among the people of different parts of the world that they all are interconnected in one way or the other. Ans. Benefits of Globalisation: 1. 2. 3. 4.

List the effect of Globalisation.,"Globalisation has political, economical, social and cultural effect.","world begins to look more like the dominant power wishes is to be. McDonaldisation of the world is a clear example of increasing effect of American culture. Culture is a dynamic concept. All culture accept outside influences all the time. These changes simple enlarge our choices, and sometimes they modify our culture without overwhelming the traditional. The Burger is added on to our food choices. In the same way Blue jeans can go well with the homespun khadi kurti. The outcome of outside influence is a new combination that is unique, a Khadi kurta worn over jeans, interestingly this clothing combination has been exported back to the country that gave us blue jeans so that it is possible to see young Americans wearing a Kurta and jeans. While cultural globalisation is a facet of globalisation, the same process also generate precisely the opposite effect. It leads to each culture becoming more different and distinctive. This phenomenon is called cultural heterogenisation. This is not to deny that there remain differences in power when cultures interact but instead more fundamentally to suggest that cultural exchange is rarely one way. Q.16. Explain any four consequences of globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. (i) Political: Globalisation affect ‘traditional conceptions of state sovereignty’. It result in an erosion of state capacity, that is, the ability of government to do what they do. It encourages more minimalist states in place of welfare state. Now they perform only two core functions of maintenance of law and under and the security of its citizen from foreign attack. However it withdraws from many of its earlier welfare functions directed at economic and social well being. (ii) Economic: Economic concept of world is a part of chain of globalisation. Economic gloabalisation play a very important role in the world’s politics. Economic globalisation involve many international institutions like World Bank and International monetary fund. Both of these institutions play a very important role in determining economic policies across the world. Yet, globalisation must not be viewed in such narrow turns. Economic globalisation involves many factors other than these international institutions. (iii) Cultural: The consequences of globalisation are not confined only to the sphere of politics and economy. Globalisation affect us in our home, in what we eat, drink wear and indeed in what we think. It shapes what we think are our preferences. The cultural influence of globalisation leads to the fear that this process poses a threat to cultures in world. It does so, because globalisation leads to the rise of a uniform culture or what is called ‘cultural homogenisation’. The rise of a uniform culture is not the evolution of a global culture. Thus, global culture is the imposition of western culture on the rest of the world. The popularity of burger or blue jeans has a lot to do with the powerful influence of the American way of life. (iv) Economic: Globalisation encourages different opinion all through the world. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. They point out that it is likely to benefit
 only a small section of the population while impoverishing those who were dependent on the government for job and welfare (education, health, sanitation, etc.) They have called for a halt to force economic globalisation, for the poor within these countries. This would mark re-colonisation of the world. Q.17. “Sovereignty has come in the hands of global consumers rather than nation state because of globalisation.” Explain the statement. [CBSE (AI) 2012] Ans. Those on the left argue that ‘sovereignty has come in the hands of global consumers rather than nation state because of globalisation’. The statement can be explained by the following ways: i. Globalisation has influenced the role of state in developing countries. In clear words, globalisation limits the strength or capability of state or government. The ideology of welfare state has been faded and it has given way to more minimalist states. ii. The state now limits itself to core functions such as the maintenance of law and order and the security of its citizens. However, it withdraws from many of its earlier welfare functions directed at economic and social well-being. In place of the welfare state, it is the market that becomes prime determinant of economic and social priorities. iii. The entry and the increased role of multinational companies all over the world leads to a reduction in the capacity of governments to take decisions as their own. iv. Globalisation has also led to the flow of ideas across national boundaries. The spread of internet and computer related services is an example of that. v. Government is lacking behind in some of its responsibilities due to globalisation. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. vi. The culture of the politically and economically dominant society leaves its imprint on a less powerful society and the world begins to look more like the dominant power it wishes to be. Q.18. Explain the positive impacts of globalisation on the present day world. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. Positive impacts of Globalisation on the present day world. (i) It has increased the opportunities for employment to a large number of people in the world. (ii) It has provided an opportunities for the flow of ideas moving from one part of the world to another. (iii) Capital can soon be transferred to any part of the world to the people in need.

Define globalisation. Explain any one criticism for globalisation. [CBSE Delhi (C) 2014]
 "
Define Globalisation. ,Globalisation means integration of a country’s economy with the world economy.,"[CBSE (AI) 2011] Ans. Globalisation refers to create social relationship world wide in such a way that a small event in a different region affects the another event taking place in a far off region. Thus globalisation is a process in which the whole earth is termed as a ‘global village’ and socio-economic contacts are based on mutual cooperation.Globalisation is different from internationalisation: (i) Globalisation focuses to link its economy with that of other countries by liberalisation and adoption of new economic policy. It strictly opposes indifferent and trade obstacles. (ii) Globalisation focuses towards international brotherhood, international institution like—USSR, World Bank, human rights and problems related to environment along with cooperation at international level and to fight against terrorism by communication. Q.8. Explain two economic consequences of globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. Economic consequences are as follows: 1. The most economic consequences of economic globalisation is greater economic flows among different countries of the world. In economic globalisation, flow of capital, commodities and ideas take place at a very high speed. Globalisation has involved greater trade in commodities across the globe. Restrictions imposed by different countries on allowing the imports of other countries have been reduced, which has eased the expansion of trade at global level. Investment on capital has also become easy. Investors now can take more profit by investing in developing and economically backward countries. 2. Economic globalisation has created an intense division of opinion all over the world. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. They point out that it is likely to profit only a small section of the population while impoverishing those who are dependent on government for job and welfare (education, health, sanitation, etc.) They have emphasised the need to ensure institutional safeguards or creating ‘social safety nets’ to minimise the negative effects of the globalisation on those who are economically weak. Q.9. Explain any four political consequences of globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2014] Or Explain any two political consequences of Globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Political consequences of globalisation are as follows:
 Q.1 What is globalisation? Enlighten any three reasons for globalisation. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Or Define globalisation. Explain any three reasons for globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Globalisation means globalise the social relationship in such a way that events taking place in some parts of the world could have an impact on another part of the world. Thus, globalisation is a process in which whole earth became a global village, in which socio-economic contact is based on mutual cooperation. Main reasons for Globalisation are as follows: 1. Revolution in Communication Technique: Technology remains a critical element. There is no doubt that the invention of telegraph, the telephone, and the microchip in more recent times has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. When printing initially came into being, it laid the basis for the creation of nationalism. Technology has affected us at individual and collective levels. Technological advancements have stimulated the transfer and movement of capital, thoughts, commodities and people from one part of the world to another and that too, easily. The movement of capital and commodities has been more than the movement of peoples across different parts of the world. 2. Flow of Capital and Commodities: Economic concept of the world has to play an important role in world politics. The mention of economic globalisation draws our attention immediately to the role of international institutions like IMF and the WTO and the role they play in determining economic policies across the world. Yet globalisation must not be viewed in such narrow terms. Economic globalisation involves many factors other than these international institutions. A much broader way of understanding of economic globalisation require us to look at the distribution of economic gains, i.e., who get the most from globalisation and who gets less, indeed who loses from it. 3. Impact of an event on all the people of World: Globalisation, however, does not emerge merely because of the availability of improved communications. What is important is for people in different parts of the world is to recognise these interconnections with the rest of the world. Currently, we are aware of the fact that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on the another part of the world. The Bird Flu or Tsunami is not confined to any particular nation. It does not respect national boundaries. Similarly, when major economic events take place, their
 impact is felt outside their immediate local, national or regional environment at the international level. Q.2. What is global ‘mutual connection’? What are its components? [NCERT] Ans. Global mutual connection means the free flow of ideas, capital commodities and people from one part of the world to another. In present times, different parts of world have come close to each other. And its credit goes to the development of means of communication. The invention of telegraph, the telephone and the microchips has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. Printing connected people living at different corners of the globe. But Globalisation however does not emerge merely because of the availability of improved communications. But people in different partsof the world recognise that they are connected to each other. Currently, we are aware of the fact that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on another part of the world like Bird Flu or Tsunami. Q.3. How do technologies contribute in the direction of globalisation? Explain. [CBSE Delhi 2013, CBSE Delhi 2015] Or How has technology contributed to the globalisation? [NCERT] Ans. Revolution in Communication Technique: Technology remains a critical element. There is no doubt that the invention of telegraph, the telephone, and the microchip in more recent times has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. When printing initially came into being, it laid the basis for the creation of nationalism. Technology has affected us at individual and collective levels. Technological advancements have stimulated the transfer and movement of capital, thoughts, commodities and people from one part of the world to another and that too, easily. The movement of capital and commodities has been more than the movement of peoples across different parts of the world. Q.4. Why is globalisation a multidimensional concept? Ans. Globalisation is a multidimensional concept because it cannot be limited within a certain sphere. Its effect can be seen in all the sectors like economic, political and cultural. It would be a blunder to accept globalisation only as an economic, political or a cultural event. The impact of globalisation is vastly uneven— it affects some parts more than others. Q.5. Define globalisation. Explain any one criticism for globalisation. [CBSE Delhi (C) 2014]
 Ans.Globalisation means globalise the social relationship in such a manner that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on another part of the world. Thus globalisation is a process in which whole earth became a global village, in which socioeconomic contact is based on mutual corporation. Apart from the sphere of economics and politics, Globalisation has affected us culturally. What we eat, drink, think and wear reflect our culture. Imposition of Western Culture on the rest of the world is leading the world to homogenous culture. It is the result of US Hegemony. Cultures seeking to buy into the dominant American dream is dangerous not only for poor countries but also for the whole of humanity, for it might lead to the shinkage of the rich cultural heritage of the entire globe. Q.6. Clarify any two positive and any two negative effects of globalisation. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. Two positive effects of globalisation are as follows: (i) As a consequence of globalisation, enhanced technologies are available with states. With these technologies, it has become easy for state to collect information about its citizens. (ii) Globalisation improves economical aspects. Economic policy of openness makes business flourish. The countries following these policies progress and prosper immensely. Negative effects of globalisation are as follows: (i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. (ii) Powerfully influenced by the American way of life, globalisation has given rise to the cultural pollution in many countries of the world. Q.7. Explain any four reasons for resistance to globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. Following are the reasons for the resistance to globalisation: (i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that make the rich richer and the poor poorer. (ii) Wea kening of the state leads to the reduction in the capacity of the state to protect the interests of its citizens, especially poor. (iii) Many countries also fear the weakening of state in political terms. Economically, they want a return to self-reliance and protectionism, at least in certain areas of the economy.

Globalisation means integration of a country’s economy with the world economy. Q.10. Which technique provides base for Nationalism? Ans. Printing (sealing) technique provide base for Nationalism. Q.11. What has been possible due to technology? Ans. The ability of ideas, capital, commodities and people to move more easily from one part of the world to another has been made possible largely by technological advances. Q.12. What is Economic Globalisation? Ans. Economic Globalisation is a process which involves greater economic flows among different countries of the world. Q.13. What are the negative effects of Globalisation? Ans. Globalisation has promoted the trend of consumerism and capitalism. Q.14. What is the political effect of Globalisation? Ans. In some aspects, globalisation reduce state capacity to protect the interests of poor but in some other aspects, state capacity has received a boost also as a consequence of globalisation as enhanced technology helps states to collect the information of its citizens. Q.15. Write one negative effect of Globalisation. Ans. It has reduced the state capacity. Q.16. To what works do states limit itself? Ans. State limits itself to perform certain core functions such as the maintenance of law and order and the security of its citizens. Q.17. How do developed countries guard their National boundaries? Ans. Developed countries have guarded their borders with Visa policies. Q.18. What is the positive effect of globalisation on state? Ans. The state capacity has received a boost with globalisation. As a consequence of globalisation, with enhanced technologies available, state can collect information about its citizens. Q.19. What has been termed as ‘recolonised’ by economists? Ans. Economists call economic globalisation as re-colonisation. Q.20. How do moderate support argue in relation to globalisation? Ans. We should face the challenges of globalisation intelligently with full care.

Explain any three advantages of Globalisation with examples. [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. Three advantages of Globalisation are as follows: 1. Political Advantages: State also gains political benefit due to globalisation. State can work efficiently by collecting information about its citizen by technology. Globalisation intensifies closeness between countries. Event occurs in one part of the world and also affects other parts of the world. States become more powerful than they were earlier as a result of globalisation. The primary of the state continues to be the unchallenged basis of political community. The state continues to discharge its essential functions (Law and order, national security) and consciously withdraws from certain domains from which it wishes. With enhanced technologies available at the disposal of the state, they can collect information about its citizens. With this information, the state is able to rule better, not less able. Thus, state becomes more powerful. 2. Economic Advantages: Globalisation has involved greater trade in commodities across the globe; the restrictions imposed by different countries on allowing the imports of the other countries have been reduced. Similarly, the restrictions on the movement of Capital across countries have also been reduced. Now the investor can invest his money anywhere in the world. Advocates of economic globalisation argue that it generates greater economic growth and well being for larger sections of the population when there is de-regulation. Greater trade among countries allows each economy to do what it does the best. This would benefit the whole world. 3. Cultural Advantages: Globalisation leads to the rise of a uniform culture. Cultures are not static things. All culture accept outside influences all the time. Sometimes external influences simply enlarge our choices, and sometimes they modify our cultures without overwhelming the traditional. The burger is no substitute for a Sambhar Vada and, therefore, does not pose any real challenge. It is simply added on to our food choices. Blue jeans, on the other hand, can go well with a homespun khadi kurta. It is interesting that this unique combination has been exported back to the country that gave us blue jeans. Globalisation lead to each culture becoming more different and distinctive. Q.2. What initiatives did India take for globalisation? Ans. India took the following initiatives for Globalisation: 1. Reforms in trade policy: These reforms in trade policy by India were carried out. •

Reforms in trade policy: These reforms in trade policy by India were carried out. •
 (i) Globalisation results in an erosion of state capacity, that is, the ability of government to do what they do. (ii) Old Welfare state is now giving way to a more minimalist state that performs certain core functions. (iii) State withdraws from many of its earlier welfare functions directed at economic and social well-being. In place of the welfare state, it is the market that becomes the prime determinant of economic and social priorities. (iv) The entry and the increased role of multinational companies all over the world leads to the reduction in the capacity of government to take decisions on their own. (Any two for II part) Q.10. ‘Welfare State is getting replaced by market.’ Analyse the reason for this change. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. Welfare state is being replaced by increasing trend of globalisation. Reasons for this change are: (i) Globalisation results in erosion of state capacity. (ii) Concept of state sovereignty is getting affected. (iii) It withdraws many welfare functions from the government. (Any two) Q.11. What are the positive impacts of Globalisation on the capabilities of the states? Ans. Globalisation results in an erosion of the state capacity is not complete true. Globalisation does not always reduce state capacity. The primacy of the state continues to be unchallenged basis of political community. The old jealousies and rivalries between countries have not ceased to matter in world politics. The state continues to discharge its essential functions (law and order, national security) and consciously withdraws from certain domains from which it wishes to. States continues to be important. Positive effects of globalisation on capacity of state are as follows: 1. State capacity has received a boost as a consequence of globalisation. 2. Increase in Information Technology has increased the capability of governance of state. 3. States have became more strong and powerful due to revolution in Information Technology. Q.12. What are the situations that encourage the globalisation?
 Ans. Situations that encourage the globalisation are as follows: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.
 Development in Science and technological sector. Collapse of communism and end of the Cold war with disintegration of USSR. Revolution in Information technology and Media. Advancement of Transport and Communication. Increase of Multinational Corporation and efforts to transform the whole world into market by developed countries. 6. Developing Countries were forced to adopt disinvestment and globalisation by World bank and International Monetary Fund due to their increased indebtedness. 7. Free Flow of money and commodities. 8. Increase in interdependence of nations. Q.13. Critically evaluate the impact of the changing role of the state in the developing countries in the context of globalisation. [NCERT] Ans. Role of developing countries is varying in the context of globalisation. Globalisation is a serious attack on politics. It has affected traditional concept of sovereignty of state. Globalisation results in an erosion of state capacity, i.e., the ability of government to do what they do. All over the world, the old welfare state is now giving way to be more minimalist state that perform certain core functions such as the maintenance of law and order and the security of its citizens. However it withdraws from many of its earlier Welfare functions directed at economic and social well-being. In place of the welfare state, it is the market that becomes the prime determinant of economic and social priorities. The entry and the increased role of multinational companies all over the world leads to a reduction in the capacity of governments to take decisions on their own. Globalisation does not always reduce state capacity. The primacy of the state continues to be the unchallenged basis of political community. The old jealousies and rivalries between countries have not ceased to matter in world politics. The state continues to discharge its essential functions (law and order, national security) and consciously withdraws from certain domains from which it wishes to. State continues to be important. Actually, globalisation has provided energy to the state. Increase in Information Technology has increased the capability of governance of state. States have become more strong and powerful due to revolution in Information Technology. Q.14. What are the economic implications of globalisation? How has globalisation impacted on India with regard to this particular dimension? [NCERT] Ans. The most important feature of process of economic globalisation is greater economic flows among different countries of the world. Some of this is voluntary and

What are the situations that encourage the globalisation?
 "
To what works do states limit itself?,State limits itself to perform certain core functions such as the maintenance of law and order and the security of its citizens.,"The Government subsidised the basic needs including health, education, etc. There were no unemployment. Minimum standard of living was ensured for all the citizens.
 "
How do developed countries guard their National boundaries?,Developed countries have guarded their borders with Visa policies.,"2. Arms Control: Arms Control regulates the acquisition or development of weapons. The Anti-ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 1972 tried to stop the United States and Soviet Union from using ballistic missiles as a defensive shield to launch a nuclear attack. While it did allow both countries to deploy a very limited number of defensive systems, it stopped them from large-scale production of those systems. The US and Soviet Union signed a number of other arms control treaties including the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty II or SALT II and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). The Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 was an arms control treaty in the sense that it regulated the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Those countries that had tested and manufactured nuclear weapons before 1967were allowed to keep their weapons; and those that had done to were to give up the right to acquire them. 3. Confidence Building: Traditional security also accepts confidence building as a means of avoiding violence. Confidence building is a process in which countries share ideas and information with their rivals. They tell each other about their military intentions and, upto a point, their military plans. This is a way of show that they are not planning a surprise attack. They also update each other about the kind of forces they possess, and they may share information on where those forces are deployed. In short, confidence building is a process designed to ensure that countries do not go to war through misunderstanding or misperception. All in all, traditional conceptions of security are principally concerned with the use or threat of use of military force. In traditional security, force is both the principal threat to security and the principal means of achieving security. Q.5. Explain non-traditional conception of security. Ans. 1. Human security: Human security is all about the protection of people more than the protection of countries. Human security and state security should be same. But secure states do not automatically mean secure peoples. Protecting citizens from foreign attack may be a necessary condition for the security of individuals, but it is certainly not a sufficient one. Indeed, during the last 100 years, more people have been killed by their own governments than by foreign armies. All defenders of human security agree that its primary goal is the protection of individuals. However, there are differences about precisely what threats individuals should be protected from. Advocates of the ‘narrow’ concept of human security focus on violent threats to individuals or, as former UN secretary–General Kofi Annan puts it, “the protection of communities and individuals from internal violence.” Proponents of the ‘broad’ concept of human security argue that the threat agenda should include hunger, disease and natural disasters because these kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined. Human security policy, they argue, should protect people from these threats and violence too. In its broadest formulation, the human security agenda also envelops economic security and ‘threats’ to ‘human dignity’. Put differently, the expansive formulation stresses what has been called ‘freedom from wants’ and ‘freedom from fear’ respectively.
 2. Global Security: The idea of global security emerged in the 1990s in response to the global nature of threats such as global warming, international terrorism, and health epidemics like AIDS and bird flu and so on. No country can resolve these problems alone. And, in some situations, one country may have to disproportionately bear the brunt of a global problem such as environment degradation. For example, dueto global warming, a sea level rise of 1.5–2.0 metres would flood 20 percent of Bangladesh, inundate most of the Maldives, and threaten nearly half the population of Thailand. Since these problems are global in nature, international cooperation is important, even though it is difficult to achieve. Q.6. In spite of strongly propagating for nuclear disarmament since Independence, India herself became nuclear in 1998. Analyse the reasons behind this development and also highlight important features of India’s nuclear policy. [CBSE Sample Paper 2016] Ans. Reasons for becoming nuclear: India shares hostile relations with its two immediate neighbours – China and Pakistan. There was a direct threat to India’s national security as China was already a nuclear state and had a war with India in 1962. Both the countries do not share very cordial relations with each other. Pakistan was also preparing to become nuclear with the help of Chinese government. So in order to preserve its national security, it was equally important for India to become a nuclear state. Features of India’s nuclear policy: 1. India believes in both horizontal and vertical nuclear disarmament. It is ready to disarm its nuclear weapons if all other counties of the world possessing nuclear weapons also disarm their nuclear weapons. 2. India has committed that it will never initiate a nuclear war against any country and will use nuclear weapons only for defensive purpose. 3. It will try to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and would possess only minimum nuclear deterrence. 4. India strongly opposes NPT and CTBT treaties as they were seen unjust and discriminatory. 5. It reiterates India’s commitment to global, verifiable and non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament leading to a nuclear weapon free world. Q.7. What is meant by traditional notions of internal and external security? Explain. [CBSE Delhi 2016] Ans. Traditional notion of internal security: The traditional notion of internal security stems from the security of a country within its borders. The nations stem from security
 from internal rebellion, dissent and other forms of attacks. After 1945, USA, Soviet Union and Europe began to see security within their internal borders while newly independent countries such as from Asia and Africabegan to see civil wars, internal uprisings, etc. within their borders. Traditional notion of external security: The traditional notion of external security stems from protecting the territorial integrity of a nation from aggression and balance of power with other nations. This notion was seen dominant till the Second World War in North America and Europe but is still continuing in Asia and Africa.

Blue jeans, on the other hand, can go well with a homespun khadi kurta. It is interesting that this unique combination has been exported back to the country that gave us blue jeans. Globalisation lead to each culture becoming more different and distinctive. Q.2. What initiatives did India take for globalisation? Ans. India took the following initiatives for Globalisation: 1. Reforms in trade policy: These reforms in trade policy by India were carried out. •
 (i) Globalisation results in an erosion of state capacity, that is, the ability of government to do what they do. (ii) Old Welfare state is now giving way to a more minimalist state that performs certain core functions. (iii) State withdraws from many of its earlier welfare functions directed at economic and social well-being. In place of the welfare state, it is the market that becomes the prime determinant of economic and social priorities. (iv) The entry and the increased role of multinational companies all over the world leads to the reduction in the capacity of government to take decisions on their own. (Any two for II part) Q.10. ‘Welfare State is getting replaced by market.’ Analyse the reason for this change. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. Welfare state is being replaced by increasing trend of globalisation. Reasons for this change are: (i) Globalisation results in erosion of state capacity. (ii) Concept of state sovereignty is getting affected. (iii) It withdraws many welfare functions from the government. (Any two) Q.11. What are the positive impacts of Globalisation on the capabilities of the states? Ans. Globalisation results in an erosion of the state capacity is not complete true. Globalisation does not always reduce state capacity. The primacy of the state continues to be unchallenged basis of political community. The old jealousies and rivalries between countries have not ceased to matter in world politics. The state continues to discharge its essential functions (law and order, national security) and consciously withdraws from certain domains from which it wishes to. States continues to be important. Positive effects of globalisation on capacity of state are as follows: 1. State capacity has received a boost as a consequence of globalisation. 2. Increase in Information Technology has increased the capability of governance of state. 3. States have became more strong and powerful due to revolution in Information Technology. Q.12. What are the situations that encourage the globalisation?
 Ans. Situations that encourage the globalisation are as follows: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.
 Development in Science and technological sector. Collapse of communism and end of the Cold war with disintegration of USSR. Revolution in Information technology and Media. Advancement of Transport and Communication. Increase of Multinational Corporation and efforts to transform the whole world into market by developed countries. 6. Developing Countries were forced to adopt disinvestment and globalisation by World bank and International Monetary Fund due to their increased indebtedness. 7. Free Flow of money and commodities. 8. Increase in interdependence of nations. Q.13. Critically evaluate the impact of the changing role of the state in the developing countries in the context of globalisation. [NCERT] Ans. Role of developing countries is varying in the context of globalisation. Globalisation is a serious attack on politics. It has affected traditional concept of sovereignty of state. Globalisation results in an erosion of state capacity, i.e., the ability of government to do what they do. All over the world, the old welfare state is now giving way to be more minimalist state that perform certain core functions such as the maintenance of law and order and the security of its citizens. However it withdraws from many of its earlier Welfare functions directed at economic and social well-being. In place of the welfare state, it is the market that becomes the prime determinant of economic and social priorities. The entry and the increased role of multinational companies all over the world leads to a reduction in the capacity of governments to take decisions on their own. Globalisation does not always reduce state capacity. The primacy of the state continues to be the unchallenged basis of political community. The old jealousies and rivalries between countries have not ceased to matter in world politics. The state continues to discharge its essential functions (law and order, national security) and consciously withdraws from certain domains from which it wishes to. State continues to be important. Actually, globalisation has provided energy to the state. Increase in Information Technology has increased the capability of governance of state. States have become more strong and powerful due to revolution in Information Technology. Q.14. What are the economic implications of globalisation? How has globalisation impacted on India with regard to this particular dimension? [NCERT] Ans. The most important feature of process of economic globalisation is greater economic flows among different countries of the world. Some of this is voluntary and
 "
What has been termed as ‘recolonised’ by economists?,Economists call economic globalisation as re-colonisation.,"[CBSE (AI) 2011] Ans. Globalisation refers to create social relationship world wide in such a way that a small event in a different region affects the another event taking place in a far off region. Thus globalisation is a process in which the whole earth is termed as a ‘global village’ and socio-economic contacts are based on mutual cooperation.Globalisation is different from internationalisation: (i) Globalisation focuses to link its economy with that of other countries by liberalisation and adoption of new economic policy. It strictly opposes indifferent and trade obstacles. (ii) Globalisation focuses towards international brotherhood, international institution like—USSR, World Bank, human rights and problems related to environment along with cooperation at international level and to fight against terrorism by communication. Q.8. Explain two economic consequences of globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. Economic consequences are as follows: 1. The most economic consequences of economic globalisation is greater economic flows among different countries of the world. In economic globalisation, flow of capital, commodities and ideas take place at a very high speed. Globalisation has involved greater trade in commodities across the globe. Restrictions imposed by different countries on allowing the imports of other countries have been reduced, which has eased the expansion of trade at global level. Investment on capital has also become easy. Investors now can take more profit by investing in developing and economically backward countries. 2. Economic globalisation has created an intense division of opinion all over the world. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. They point out that it is likely to profit only a small section of the population while impoverishing those who are dependent on government for job and welfare (education, health, sanitation, etc.) They have emphasised the need to ensure institutional safeguards or creating ‘social safety nets’ to minimise the negative effects of the globalisation on those who are economically weak. Q.9. Explain any four political consequences of globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2014] Or Explain any two political consequences of Globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Political consequences of globalisation are as follows:
 some forced by international institutions and powerful countries. Flow or exchange can take various forms: Commodities, Capital, people and ideas, Globalisation has involved greater trade in commodities across the globe; the restrictions imposed by different countries on allowing the imports of other countries have been reduced. The restrictions on movement of capital across countries have also been reduced. In operational terms, it means that investors in the rich countries can invest their money in countries other than their own, including developing countries, where they might get better return. Globalisation has also led to the flow of ideas across national boundaries. The spread of internet and computer related services is an example of that. Consequences of globalisation are not the same in every country. They may vary. Economic globalisation has created an intense division of opinion all over the world. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. They point out that it is likely to benefit only a small section of the population while impoverishing those who were dependent on the government for job and welfare (education, health, sanitation, etc.) They have emphasised the need to ensure institutional safeguards or creating ‘social safety nets’ to minimise the negative effects of globalisation on those who are economically weak. Advocates of economic globalisation argue that it generates greater economic growth and well-being for larger section of the population when there is de-regulation. They also advocate that economic globalisation is inevitable and it is not wise to resist the march of history. More moderate supporters of globalisation says that globalisation provide a challenge that can be responded to intelligently without accepting it uncritically. Interdependence and integration between governments, business and ordinary people in different parts of the world has increased as a result of globalisation. In 1991, responding to a financial crisis and to the desire for higher rates of economic growth, India embarked on a programme of economic reforms that has sought increasingly to deregulate various sectors including trade and foreign investment. It is not possible to say how good this has been for India, the ultimate test is not high growth rates as making sure that the benefits of growth are shared so that everyone is better off. Q.15. Do you agree with the argument that globalisation leads to cultural heterogeneity? [NCERT] Ans. Yes. Globalisation influence our culture upto an extent. Globalisation affect us in our home, in our home, in what we eat, drink, wear and indeed in what we think. Globalisation leads to the rise of a uniform culture or what is called homogenisation. The rise of a uniform culture is not the evolution of a global culture. This is imposition of Western culture on the rest of the world. US hegemony can be seen on different cultures. The popularity of a burger or blue jeans, some argue, has a lot to do with the powerful effect of the American way of life. Thus, the culture of the politically and economically dominant society leaves its imprint on a less powerful society, and the
 world begins to look more like the dominant power wishes is to be. McDonaldisation of the world is a clear example of increasing effect of American culture. Culture is a dynamic concept. All culture accept outside influences all the time. These changes simple enlarge our choices, and sometimes they modify our culture without overwhelming the traditional. The Burger is added on to our food choices. In the same way Blue jeans can go well with the homespun khadi kurti. The outcome of outside influence is a new combination that is unique, a Khadi kurta worn over jeans, interestingly this clothing combination has been exported back to the country that gave us blue jeans so that it is possible to see young Americans wearing a Kurta and jeans. While cultural globalisation is a facet of globalisation, the same process also generate precisely the opposite effect. It leads to each culture becoming more different and distinctive. This phenomenon is called cultural heterogenisation. This is not to deny that there remain differences in power when cultures interact but instead more fundamentally to suggest that cultural exchange is rarely one way. Q.16. Explain any four consequences of globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. (i) Political: Globalisation affect ‘traditional conceptions of state sovereignty’. It result in an erosion of state capacity, that is, the ability of government to do what they do. It encourages more minimalist states in place of welfare state. Now they perform only two core functions of maintenance of law and under and the security of its citizen from foreign attack. However it withdraws from many of its earlier welfare functions directed at economic and social well being. (ii) Economic: Economic concept of world is a part of chain of globalisation. Economic gloabalisation play a very important role in the world’s politics. Economic globalisation involve many international institutions like World Bank and International monetary fund. Both of these institutions play a very important role in determining economic policies across the world. Yet, globalisation must not be viewed in such narrow turns. Economic globalisation involves many factors other than these international institutions. (iii) Cultural: The consequences of globalisation are not confined only to the sphere of politics and economy. Globalisation affect us in our home, in what we eat, drink wear and indeed in what we think. It shapes what we think are our preferences. The cultural influence of globalisation leads to the fear that this process poses a threat to cultures in world. It does so, because globalisation leads to the rise of a uniform culture or what is called ‘cultural homogenisation’. The rise of a uniform culture is not the evolution of a global culture. Thus, global culture is the imposition of western culture on the rest of the world. The popularity of burger or blue jeans has a lot to do with the powerful influence of the American way of life. (iv) Economic: Globalisation encourages different opinion all through the world. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. They point out that it is likely to benefit
 only a small section of the population while impoverishing those who were dependent on the government for job and welfare (education, health, sanitation, etc.) They have called for a halt to force economic globalisation, for the poor within these countries. This would mark re-colonisation of the world. Q.17. “Sovereignty has come in the hands of global consumers rather than nation state because of globalisation.” Explain the statement. [CBSE (AI) 2012] Ans. Those on the left argue that ‘sovereignty has come in the hands of global consumers rather than nation state because of globalisation’. The statement can be explained by the following ways: i. Globalisation has influenced the role of state in developing countries. In clear words, globalisation limits the strength or capability of state or government. The ideology of welfare state has been faded and it has given way to more minimalist states. ii. The state now limits itself to core functions such as the maintenance of law and order and the security of its citizens. However, it withdraws from many of its earlier welfare functions directed at economic and social well-being. In place of the welfare state, it is the market that becomes prime determinant of economic and social priorities. iii. The entry and the increased role of multinational companies all over the world leads to a reduction in the capacity of governments to take decisions as their own. iv. Globalisation has also led to the flow of ideas across national boundaries. The spread of internet and computer related services is an example of that. v. Government is lacking behind in some of its responsibilities due to globalisation. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. vi. The culture of the politically and economically dominant society leaves its imprint on a less powerful society and the world begins to look more like the dominant power it wishes to be. Q.18. Explain the positive impacts of globalisation on the present day world. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. Positive impacts of Globalisation on the present day world. (i) It has increased the opportunities for employment to a large number of people in the world. (ii) It has provided an opportunities for the flow of ideas moving from one part of the world to another. (iii) Capital can soon be transferred to any part of the world to the people in need.

[CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Internal notion of traditional security: (i) Internal military conflicts.
 (ii) Separatist movements: Internally, these states feared threats from separatist movements which wanted to form independent states. Sometimes, both external and internal threats submerged. This was because a neighbour might aid and abet internal separatist movements leading to tension between the two neighbouring states. (iii) Internal wars: Internal wars now account for more than 95% of the armed conflicts all over the world. There has been a steep rise twelve times in the number of civil wars, between 1946 and 1991 the highest jump in over 200 years. External notion of traditional security: (i) Danger to a country from military threats The source of such a security threat emerges from another country which, through its military action, threatens the core values of sovereignity, independence and territorial integrity. Military action even endangers the life of ordinary residents of a country. In a war, it is highly unlikely that only soldiers would die or be hurt. In all the likelihood, men and women, who are ordinary citizens and soft targets are made victims in a war, to break their support for the war. (ii) Deterrence, defence and balance of power Governments may even make the choice of surrender when actually in a war, but this may not be promoted as a country’s defence policy. Security policy, is hence, concerned with preventing war, which is known as deterrence, and with limiting or ending war, which is called defence. (iii) Alliance building as components of traditional security An alliance is a coalition of countries to deter or defend themselves unitedly against any possible military attack. Most alliances are formal written treaties based on a clear identification of potential threatening countries. Countries form military alliances to revitalise their effective power strength against other possible military alliance threats. (Any two points) Q.15. Nuclear weapons as deterrence or defence have limited usage against contemporary security threats to states. Explain the statement. [NCERT] Ans. Non-traditional notions of security go beyond military threats to include a wide range of threats and dangers affecting the conditions of human existence. These threats are poverty, epidemic, global warming, etc. Military attack causes threat not only the country but also affects whole human existence. Hunger, disease and natural disasters kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined. When war was considered as the greatest threat condition to the security, it occurred due to nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are of no use in front of these threats at present. They cannot contribute in any way to solve them. Q.16. Rapid environmental degradation is causing a serious threat to security. Do you agree with the statement? Substantiate your arguments.

What are the two notions of non-traditional security?,1. Human Security 2. Global Security,"[CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. Following are the reasons behind increasing terrorism on international level: 1. Information and Technology have paved way for terrorism in its way of execution. That is why, terrorism is a global problem all over the world. 2. Globalisation of economy is responsible behind the situations like theft, hijacking plains or planting of bombs, etc. The exchange of currency of any country has become easier for terrorists. 3. There is a competition of selling modernised weapons. The mastermind, government and traders are equally responsible behind spreading terror at individual level. 4. Advanced transport systems and mediums have enhanced terrorism. Q.8. Identify and elaborate any four sources of security threats. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. Following are the new sources of security threats: 1. Terrorism: It refers to political violence that targets civilians deliberately and indiscriminately. International terrorism involves the citizens or territory of more than one country. Terrorist groups seek to change a political context or condition that they do not like by force or threat of force. Civilian targets are usually chosen to terrorise the public and to use the unhappiness of the public as a weapon against national governments or other parties in conflict. 2. Global Poverty: Global Poverty is another source of insecurity. World population now at 650 crore will reach 700 to 800 within 25 years and may eventually level out of 900 to 1000 crore. Currently, half the world’s population growth occurs in just six countries—India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Among the World’s poorest countries, population is expected to triple in the next 50 years, whereas many rich countries will see population’s shrinkage in that period. High growth rate, high per capita income, high Education level and low population growth will make rich states or rich social groups get richer where as low growth rate, low per capita income, low education level and huge population growth reinforce each other to make poor states and poor groups become poorer. 3. Migration: Poverty in the South has also led to large-scale migration to seek a better life, especially better economic opportunities in the North. This has created international political frictions. International law and norms make a distinction between migrants and refugees. States are generally supposed to accept refugees,but they do not have to accept migrants. While refugees leave their country of origin, people who have fled their homes but remain within national borders are called internally displaced people. 4. Health Epidemics: Health Epidemics such as HIV-AIDS, bird flu, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have rapidly spread across countries through migration,
 business, tourism and military operations. One country’s success or failure in limiting the spread of these diseases affects infections in other countries. By 2003, an estimated 4 crore people were infected with HIV-AIDS worldwide, twothirds of them in Africa and half of the rest in South Asia. Q.9. How many types of human rights are there? Ans. Human rights is an issue of human security. Human rights have come to be classified into three types: 1. Political Right seen as voting right, right to contest election and freedom of speech and assembly. 2. Economic and social rights such as right to earn, right to work, right of social security, etc. 3. Right to colonised people or ethnic and indigenous minorities. More emphasis have been given to these rights but there is no agreement on which set of rights should be considered as universal human rights, nor what the international community should do when rights are being violated. Since the 1990s, developments such as Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, the genocide in Rwanda, and the Indonesian military’s killing of people in East Timor have led to a debate on whether or not the UN should intervene to stop human rights abuses. There are those who argue that the UN charter empowers the international community totake up arms in defence of human rights. Others argue that the national interests of the powerful states will determine which instance of human right violations the UN should act upon. Q.10. List any four policy directive principles of state mentioned in Indian constitution to promote and international peace and security. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Measures of environmental protection, security to wild animals and increase in international peace and security have been mentioned in Article 51 of Indian constitution. On the basis of which India would regulate its foreign policy. Following are the principles: 1. To increase international peace and security. 2. To maintain justified and respectful relations between nations. 3. Foster respect for international law and treaty obligations in the dealings of organised peoples with one another. 4. To make efforts to mediate international controversies and promote settlement of international disputes by arbitration. Q.11. Explain the concept of ‘Human Security.’ [CBSE (AI) 2015]

To make efforts to mediate international controversies and promote settlement of international disputes by arbitration. Q.11. Explain the concept of ‘Human Security.’ [CBSE (AI) 2015]
 Ans. Human Security means the protection of the people more than the protection of states. The proponents of human security argue that the primary aim of the state is the protection of its individuals. According to them the concept of human security should include hunger, diseases and natural disasters as they kill even more people than war.Thus, human security should protect people from these threats as well as from violence and war. In its broadest formulation, the human security agenda also encompasses economic security and ‘threats to human dignity’. Q.12. Explain four components of India’s security strategy. [CBSE Delhi, (AI) 2014] Ans. India’s security strategy has four broad components, which have been used in a varying combinations from time to time. 1. Strengthening Military Capabilities: India has been involved in conflicts with its neighbour—Pakistan in 1947-48, 1965, 1971 and 1999; and China in 1962. Since it is surrounded by nuclear-armed countries in the South Asian Region, India’s decision to conduct nuclear test in 1998 was justified by the Indian government in terms of safeguarding national security. India first tested a nuclear device in 1974. 2. Strengthen International Norms: India’s security strategy has been to strengthen international norms and international institutions to protect its security interests. India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru supported the cause of Asian solidarity, decolonisation, disarmament and the UN as a forum in which international conflicts could be settled. Most importantly it used non-alignment to help carve out an area of peace outside the bloc politics of the two superpowers. India joined 160 countries that have signed and ratified the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which provides a road map for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases to check global warming. Indian troops have been sent abroad on UN peacekeeping missions in support of cooperative security initiatives. 3. Internal Security: The third component of Indian security strategy is geared towards meeting security challenges within the country. Several militant groups from areas such as Nagaland, Mizoram, Punjab and Kashmir among others have, from time to time sought to break away from India. India has tried to preserve national unity by adopting a democratic political system, which allows different communities and groups of people to freely articulate their grievances and share political power. 4. Economic Growth: There has been an attempt in India to develop its economy in a way that the vast mass of citizens are lifted out of poverty and misery and huge economic inequalities are not allowed to exist. The attempt has not quite succeeded; we are still a very poor and unequal country. Yet democratic politics allows spaces for articulating the voice of the poor and the deprived citizens. There is a pressure on the democratically elected governments to combine economic growth with human

On what alliances are based?,Alliances are based on National interests and can change when national interest changes.,"Following are the differences between them: Traditional policy 1. There are more changes of military attack. 2. Ordinary men and women are madetargets of war along with the soldiers. 3. Only military comes under threat. 4. It is concerned with preventingwar, balance of power and formingalliances.
 Non-traditional policy 1. Non-traditional notions of securitygo beyond military threats to includea wide range of threats and dangersaffecting the conditions of humanexistence. 2. Whole human existence comesunder threat. 3. Threat involves epidemic, famineand natural calamity. 4. Countries are expected to increasemutual cooperation.
 Alliance building comes under traditional security. Many countries are involved in an alliance. They take steps in the direction of preventing war or defend against military attack. It aims at national interests. Q.13. What are the choices available to a state when its security is threatened, according to traditional security perspective? [NCERT] Ans. In the traditional conception of security, the greatest danger to a country is from military threats. The source of this danger is another country which by threatening military action endangers the core values of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. Agriculture, trade, business and industries of the region of war are affected adversely. Quite often, ordinary women and men are made targets of war to break their support to the war. In responding to the threat of a war, a government has three basic choices: 1. To surrender 2. To prevent the other side from attacking by promising to raise the costs of war to an unacceptable level; 3. To defend itself when war actually breaks out so as to deny the attacking country its objectives. Q.14. Distinguish between the internal and external notion of traditional security. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Internal notion of traditional security: (i) Internal military conflicts.
 Q.1. What is ‘Balance of Power’? How could a state achieve this? [NCERT] Ans. ‘Balance of Power’ is a component of traditional security policy—It is a widely accepted fact that countries of world never had same geography, population, financial resources, military, etc. So, balance of power is integral in states. When small countries look around them, they see that some countries are bigger and stronger. This is a clue to who might be a threat in the future. For instance, a neighbouring country may not say it is preparing for attack. There may be no obvious reason for attack. But the fact that this country is very powerful is a sign that some point in the future, it may choose to be aggressive. Governments are, therefore, very sensitive to the balance of power between their country and other countries. They do work hard to maintain a favourable balance of power with other countries, especially those close by, those with whom they have differences, or with those they have had conflicts in the past. A good part of maintaining a balance of power is to build up one’s military power, although economic and technological power are also important as they are the bases for military power. Q.2. What are the objectives of military alliances? Give an example of a functioning military, alliance with its specific objectives. [NCERT] Ans. An alliance is a coalition of states that coordinate their actions to deter or defend against military attack. Most alliances are formalised in written treaties and are based on a fairly clear identification of who constitutes the threat. Countries form alliances to increase the effective power relative to another country or alliance. NATO is a powerful organisation, which is still into existence. It aims at maintaining military security of American and West European countries that came under the leadership of USA. It also aims at maintaining military, cultural and economic dominance on western countries. Q.3. What are the four elements of security? Give an example of each. [CBSE Sample Paper] Ans. There are the four elements of security: 1. Deterrence: The condition where war is tried to be prevented, like nuclear power acted as a deterrent between both the super powers during the Cold War. 2. Military Power: To raise military power to limit or prevent the war and to face external power.
 3. Balance of power: Every country works hard to maintain a favourable balance of power, especially in military. For example, purchasing weapons from foreign countries for modernisation of military by India and Pakistan. 4. To form alliances: Some countries form an alliance to increase their military power and coordinate their actions to deter or defend against military attack done on any of the country. For example, ‘NATO’ and ‘Warsaw Pact’ were established by America and USSR respectively. Q.4. Explain the process of confidence building under traditional security conception. Ans. Traditional security also accepts confidence building as a means of avoiding violence. Confidence building is a process in which countries share their thoughts and information with their rivals. They tell each other about their military intentions and, up to a point, their military plans. This is a way to show that they are not planning a surprise attack. They also tell each other about the kind of forces they possess, and they may share information on where those forces are deployed. In short, confidence building is a process designed to ensure that rivals do not go to war through misunderstanding or misperception. Q.5. Explain the importance of cooperation in the field of ‘Traditional Security.’ [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. The importance of cooperation in the field of ‘Traditional Security’ is disarmament, arms control, and confidence building. Disarmament requires all states to give up certain kinds of weapons. For example, the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and 1992 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) banned the production and possession of these weapons. Arms control regulates the acquisition or development of weapons. The AntiBallistic Missile (ABM) Treaty 1972 tried to stop the United States and the Soviet Union from using ballistic missiles as a defensive shield to launch a nuclear attack. Confidence Building is accepted as a means of avoiding violence. It is a process in which countries share ideas and information with their rivals. Q.6. What is disarmament? Ans. Disarmament literally means ‘not keeping arms’. But no country can safeguard its boundaries without its military capability. So, disarmament refers to limit traditional weapons within a boundary by preventing nuclear weapons. The competition of weapons among countries have caused a global threat to international peace. The need of the hour is to end this competition and establish international peace. Q.7. What are the reasons behind increase in terrorism at international level?

What do you call a government? ,A renowned organisation which deals with internal threats and violence of a country is called a ‘government’.,"(ii) Separatist movements: Internally, these states feared threats from separatist movements which wanted to form independent states. Sometimes, both external and internal threats submerged. This was because a neighbour might aid and abet internal separatist movements leading to tension between the two neighbouring states. (iii) Internal wars: Internal wars now account for more than 95% of the armed conflicts all over the world. There has been a steep rise twelve times in the number of civil wars, between 1946 and 1991 the highest jump in over 200 years. External notion of traditional security: (i) Danger to a country from military threats The source of such a security threat emerges from another country which, through its military action, threatens the core values of sovereignity, independence and territorial integrity. Military action even endangers the life of ordinary residents of a country. In a war, it is highly unlikely that only soldiers would die or be hurt. In all the likelihood, men and women, who are ordinary citizens and soft targets are made victims in a war, to break their support for the war. (ii) Deterrence, defence and balance of power Governments may even make the choice of surrender when actually in a war, but this may not be promoted as a country’s defence policy. Security policy, is hence, concerned with preventing war, which is known as deterrence, and with limiting or ending war, which is called defence. (iii) Alliance building as components of traditional security An alliance is a coalition of countries to deter or defend themselves unitedly against any possible military attack. Most alliances are formal written treaties based on a clear identification of potential threatening countries. Countries form military alliances to revitalise their effective power strength against other possible military alliance threats. (Any two points) Q.15. Nuclear weapons as deterrence or defence have limited usage against contemporary security threats to states. Explain the statement. [NCERT] Ans. Non-traditional notions of security go beyond military threats to include a wide range of threats and dangers affecting the conditions of human existence. These threats are poverty, epidemic, global warming, etc. Military attack causes threat not only the country but also affects whole human existence. Hunger, disease and natural disasters kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined. When war was considered as the greatest threat condition to the security, it occurred due to nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are of no use in front of these threats at present. They cannot contribute in any way to solve them. Q.16. Rapid environmental degradation is causing a serious threat to security. Do you agree with the statement? Substantiate your arguments.

 "
What does disarmament require?,Disarmament requires all states to give up certain kinds of weapons.,"2. Arms Control: Arms Control regulates the acquisition or development of weapons. The Anti-ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 1972 tried to stop the United States and Soviet Union from using ballistic missiles as a defensive shield to launch a nuclear attack. While it did allow both countries to deploy a very limited number of defensive systems, it stopped them from large-scale production of those systems. The US and Soviet Union signed a number of other arms control treaties including the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty II or SALT II and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). The Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 was an arms control treaty in the sense that it regulated the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Those countries that had tested and manufactured nuclear weapons before 1967were allowed to keep their weapons; and those that had done to were to give up the right to acquire them. 3. Confidence Building: Traditional security also accepts confidence building as a means of avoiding violence. Confidence building is a process in which countries share ideas and information with their rivals. They tell each other about their military intentions and, upto a point, their military plans. This is a way of show that they are not planning a surprise attack. They also update each other about the kind of forces they possess, and they may share information on where those forces are deployed. In short, confidence building is a process designed to ensure that countries do not go to war through misunderstanding or misperception. All in all, traditional conceptions of security are principally concerned with the use or threat of use of military force. In traditional security, force is both the principal threat to security and the principal means of achieving security. Q.5. Explain non-traditional conception of security. Ans. 1. Human security: Human security is all about the protection of people more than the protection of countries. Human security and state security should be same. But secure states do not automatically mean secure peoples. Protecting citizens from foreign attack may be a necessary condition for the security of individuals, but it is certainly not a sufficient one. Indeed, during the last 100 years, more people have been killed by their own governments than by foreign armies. All defenders of human security agree that its primary goal is the protection of individuals. However, there are differences about precisely what threats individuals should be protected from. Advocates of the ‘narrow’ concept of human security focus on violent threats to individuals or, as former UN secretary–General Kofi Annan puts it, “the protection of communities and individuals from internal violence.” Proponents of the ‘broad’ concept of human security argue that the threat agenda should include hunger, disease and natural disasters because these kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined. Human security policy, they argue, should protect people from these threats and violence too. In its broadest formulation, the human security agenda also envelops economic security and ‘threats’ to ‘human dignity’. Put differently, the expansive formulation stresses what has been called ‘freedom from wants’ and ‘freedom from fear’ respectively.

What was the effect of Non-proliferation Treaty?,Non-proliferation Treaty did not end atomic wars but decreased the number of countries that could get this.,"Q.1. Why War didn’t happen during Cold War? Ans. Due to the theory of deterrence. Q.2. Why did smaller states in the alliance link themselves on any of the superpowers? Ans. Self-protection and to limit the authority of other superpower. Q.3. What was the need of land-area of smaller countries to superpowers? Ans. To make the land area as base for the operation of their weapons and their military. Q.4. What was the greatest need of non-aligned countries? Ans. They needed to be economically more developed and improve the living standards of people by bringing them above poverty line. Q.5. What was the major change in nature of non-alignment? Ans. Economic issues received more importance. Q.6. Why did Indian government sign the treaty with Soviet Union in 1971? Ans. India needed diplomatic and possible military support during the Bangladesh crisis. Q.7. Why did both the blocs have huge stock of weapons during the Cold War? Ans. Cold War did not eliminate rivalries between the two alliances, mutual suspicions led them to arm themselves to the teeth and to constantly prepare for war. Huge stock of arms was considered necessary for the prevention of occurrence of war. Q.8. What were the changes in Global politics after the Second World War? Ans. After the Second World War, two new power rose on the global stage. With the defeat of Germany and Japan, the devastation of Europe and in many other parts of the world, the United States and USSR became the greatest powers in the world with the ability to influence events anywhere on earth. The two superpowers were keen on expanding their sphere of influence in different parts of the world. The world was visibly divided between the two alliance systems. Q.9. What was the Chief reason behind the Cold War? Ans. The superpowers emerged in the world after the Second World War. Both the countries wanted to take over the lead and this was the major cause for the Cold War.
 "
Non-traditional notions of security is related to what?,Non-traditional notions of security go beyond military threats to include a wide range of threats and danger affecting the conditions of human existence.,"[CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. 1. In the traditional conception of security, the greatest danger to a country is from military threats. The source of this danger is another country which by threatening military action endangers the core values of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. 2. Military action also endangers the lives of ordinary citizens. Q.10. What is the viewpoint of world towards war under traditional concept of security? Ans. It is now an almost universally accepted view that countries should only go to war for the right reasons, primarily self-defence or to protect other people from genocide. War must also be limited in terms of the means that are used. Armies must avoid killing or hurting non-combatants as well as unarmed and surrendering combatants. They should not be excessively violent. Force must in any case be used only after all the alternatives have failed. Q.11. What is meant by non-traditional notion of security? Differentiate between the narrow and the broad concept of human security. [CBSE (AI) 2016] Ans. Non-traditional notion of security are non-military threats such human security, climate change, environmental security, economic security, pandemics, social issues, etc. Human security is the combination of threats associated with war, genocide, and the displacement of populations. Human security in simple terms means freedom fromwant and ‘freedom from fear’. The narrow concept of human security includes security from violence that’s occurs from wars and armed conflicts. The broader concept of human security includes safety from economic, pandemic, environmental and social conflicts and unrests. Kofi Annan puts it as the protection of communities and individuals from internal violence. Q.12. What is the difference between traditional and non-traditional security? Which category would the creation and sustenance of alliances belong to? [NCERT] Or What are the differences between policies traditional and non-traditional security? [CBSE Delhi 2014, 2015] Ans. There are two policies of security: 1. Traditional policy 2. Non-traditional policy.
 Following are the differences between them: Traditional policy 1. There are more changes of military attack. 2. Ordinary men and women are madetargets of war along with the soldiers. 3. Only military comes under threat. 4. It is concerned with preventingwar, balance of power and formingalliances.
 Non-traditional policy 1. Non-traditional notions of securitygo beyond military threats to includea wide range of threats and dangersaffecting the conditions of humanexistence. 2. Whole human existence comesunder threat. 3. Threat involves epidemic, famineand natural calamity. 4. Countries are expected to increasemutual cooperation.

Whole human existence comesunder threat. 3. Threat involves epidemic, famineand natural calamity. 4. Countries are expected to increasemutual cooperation.
 Alliance building comes under traditional security. Many countries are involved in an alliance. They take steps in the direction of preventing war or defend against military attack. It aims at national interests. Q.13. What are the choices available to a state when its security is threatened, according to traditional security perspective? [NCERT] Ans. In the traditional conception of security, the greatest danger to a country is from military threats. The source of this danger is another country which by threatening military action endangers the core values of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. Agriculture, trade, business and industries of the region of war are affected adversely. Quite often, ordinary women and men are made targets of war to break their support to the war. In responding to the threat of a war, a government has three basic choices: 1. To surrender 2. To prevent the other side from attacking by promising to raise the costs of war to an unacceptable level; 3. To defend itself when war actually breaks out so as to deny the attacking country its objectives. Q.14. Distinguish between the internal and external notion of traditional security. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Internal notion of traditional security: (i) Internal military conflicts.

 "
Which are global threats?,"Global warming, international terrorism, AIDS and bird flu are global threats.","[CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. Following are the reasons behind increasing terrorism on international level: 1. Information and Technology have paved way for terrorism in its way of execution. That is why, terrorism is a global problem all over the world. 2. Globalisation of economy is responsible behind the situations like theft, hijacking plains or planting of bombs, etc. The exchange of currency of any country has become easier for terrorists. 3. There is a competition of selling modernised weapons. The mastermind, government and traders are equally responsible behind spreading terror at individual level. 4. Advanced transport systems and mediums have enhanced terrorism. Q.8. Identify and elaborate any four sources of security threats. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. Following are the new sources of security threats: 1. Terrorism: It refers to political violence that targets civilians deliberately and indiscriminately. International terrorism involves the citizens or territory of more than one country. Terrorist groups seek to change a political context or condition that they do not like by force or threat of force. Civilian targets are usually chosen to terrorise the public and to use the unhappiness of the public as a weapon against national governments or other parties in conflict. 2. Global Poverty: Global Poverty is another source of insecurity. World population now at 650 crore will reach 700 to 800 within 25 years and may eventually level out of 900 to 1000 crore. Currently, half the world’s population growth occurs in just six countries—India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Among the World’s poorest countries, population is expected to triple in the next 50 years, whereas many rich countries will see population’s shrinkage in that period. High growth rate, high per capita income, high Education level and low population growth will make rich states or rich social groups get richer where as low growth rate, low per capita income, low education level and huge population growth reinforce each other to make poor states and poor groups become poorer. 3. Migration: Poverty in the South has also led to large-scale migration to seek a better life, especially better economic opportunities in the North. This has created international political frictions. International law and norms make a distinction between migrants and refugees. States are generally supposed to accept refugees,but they do not have to accept migrants. While refugees leave their country of origin, people who have fled their homes but remain within national borders are called internally displaced people. 4. Health Epidemics: Health Epidemics such as HIV-AIDS, bird flu, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have rapidly spread across countries through migration,

How did madcow and bird flu affect countries?,Britain had lost billions of dollars of income during madcow diseases and bird flu as it had to shut down the supplies of poultry exports from several Asian countries.,"10,000corporate and private shareholders was lost, along with the money kept in the bank by customers. Q.13. How did India benefit from Russia’s friendship after the disintegration of Soviet Union? [CBSE Sample Paper] Ans. Benefit to India from Russia: 1. Russia supported India during the Kargil War. 2. Russia supplied raw material to India for the development of energy sector. Q.14. Analyse Soviet Union’s situation after the Second World War. Ans. After the Second World War, Soviet Union became a great power. Soviet Union progressed in every field. The Soviet economy was then more developed than the rest of the world. Vast mineral and energy resources helped it in its economical development and progress. There was an improvement in the efficiency of transport sector. Eventhe remote areas of USSR were connected with the capital Moscow. It also improved much in scientific sector. It was successful in sending first space traveller to Moon. It was a leading country in terms of production of nuclear weapons. Everyone in Soviet Union had consumer goods, though their quality did not match that of the Western Capitalist countries. Yet basic necessities including health, education, childcare were available to all. There was no unemployment. All citizens were ensured of minimum living standards. Q.15. Why were people dissatisfied with Soviet System? Ans. Soviet system was based on the ideology but after the Second World War, there was an internal dissatisfaction which erupted like fire. The economic, social and political lives of Soviet citizens were under the state control, due to which bureaucracy increased, making life very difficult for its citizens. The Soviet political system centered around communist party. Thus, no proper system of democracy and freedom of speech was there. The party bureaucrats gained more privileges than ordinary citizens, which increased dissatisfaction among the people. The bureaucrats and authoritarians were not answerable to common people. There was a discrimination among the citizens of Russian republics and citizens of other republics due to which the citizens of other republics felt neglected and often suppressed. Q.16. Which step of Soviet Union in the period of Brezhnev led to its disintegration? Ans. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 weakened the system. Its economy ruined due to this step. Even after hard practice of ten years (1979-89), it couldn’t gain full control over Afghanistan and finally, it had to call back its armies. Invading Soviet Union in Afghanistan resulted in continuous shortage of consumer good and food products. The conditions were so miserable that food imports increased every year and
 it led to the increase in the dissatisfaction and anger amongst people. The Soviet economy was faltering in the late 1970s, became stagnant and finally Soviet Union disintegrated. Q.17. How did Soviet disintegration affect International economy? Ans. After the disintegration of Soviet Union, capitalist system gained more popularity than communist system. America gained benefit from this as it didn’t have to face any kind of problem in the expansion of its capitalist system. America evolved as the only superpower. The people of its opposite alliance were attracted towards its system. Now on the basis of America’s power and reputation, capitalist economy is the dominant economy at international level. Institutions like World Bank and IMF became advisories of different countries as these institutions provided loan to those countries to encourage them to move towards capitalist economy. In this manner, disintegration of Soviet Union had completely changed the International economical system. Q.18. ‘Although India has established good relationships with all the communist countries, yet the relations of India and Russia are most cordial.’ Explain the above statement with any three arguments in favour. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Or Describe the relations of India and early communist countries. Ans. During the Cold War era, India and the USSR enjoyed a special relationship, which led critics to say that India was part of the Soviet Camp. It was a multidimensional relationship. (i) Political: The Soviet Union supported India’s stand on the Kashmir issue in the UN. It also supported India during its major conflicts, especially during the war with Pakistan in 1971. India too supported Soviet foreign policy in some crucial but indirect ways (When US had sent flotillas in Pacific Ocean). (ii) Economic: The Soviet Union assisted India’s public sector companies at a time when such assistance was difficult to get. It gave aid and technical assistance for steel plants like Bhilai, Bokaro, Visakhapatnam and machinery plants like Bharat Heavy Electrical Ltd., etc. The Soviet Union accepted Indian currency for tradewhen India was short of foreign exchange. (iii) Military: India received most of its military hardware from the Soviet Union at a time when few other countries were willing at part with military technologies. The Soviet Union entered into various agreements allowing India to jointly produce military equipments. (iv) Culture: Hindi films and Indian culture were popular in the Soviet Union. A large number of Indian writers and artists visited the USSR. India has maintained good
 allow it to make big investments in other countries. As a result of ‘shock therapy’, the value of Rubble, the Russian currency declined dramatically. The real GDP of Russia in 1999 was below what it was in 1989.Ten years after the introduction of Shock therapy, Russia could revive its economy.

What do epidemics demonstrate?,"Epidemics demonstrate the growing inter-dependence of states, making their borders less meaningful than in the past and emphasise the need for international cooperation.","Development in Science and technological sector. Collapse of communism and end of the Cold war with disintegration of USSR. Revolution in Information technology and Media. Advancement of Transport and Communication. Increase of Multinational Corporation and efforts to transform the whole world into market by developed countries. 6. Developing Countries were forced to adopt disinvestment and globalisation by World bank and International Monetary Fund due to their increased indebtedness. 7. Free Flow of money and commodities. 8. Increase in interdependence of nations. Q.13. Critically evaluate the impact of the changing role of the state in the developing countries in the context of globalisation. [NCERT] Ans. Role of developing countries is varying in the context of globalisation. Globalisation is a serious attack on politics. It has affected traditional concept of sovereignty of state. Globalisation results in an erosion of state capacity, i.e., the ability of government to do what they do. All over the world, the old welfare state is now giving way to be more minimalist state that perform certain core functions such as the maintenance of law and order and the security of its citizens. However it withdraws from many of its earlier Welfare functions directed at economic and social well-being. In place of the welfare state, it is the market that becomes the prime determinant of economic and social priorities. The entry and the increased role of multinational companies all over the world leads to a reduction in the capacity of governments to take decisions on their own. Globalisation does not always reduce state capacity. The primacy of the state continues to be the unchallenged basis of political community. The old jealousies and rivalries between countries have not ceased to matter in world politics. The state continues to discharge its essential functions (law and order, national security) and consciously withdraws from certain domains from which it wishes to. State continues to be important. Actually, globalisation has provided energy to the state. Increase in Information Technology has increased the capability of governance of state. States have become more strong and powerful due to revolution in Information Technology. Q.14. What are the economic implications of globalisation? How has globalisation impacted on India with regard to this particular dimension? [NCERT] Ans. The most important feature of process of economic globalisation is greater economic flows among different countries of the world. Some of this is voluntary and
 some forced by international institutions and powerful countries. Flow or exchange can take various forms: Commodities, Capital, people and ideas, Globalisation has involved greater trade in commodities across the globe; the restrictions imposed by different countries on allowing the imports of other countries have been reduced. The restrictions on movement of capital across countries have also been reduced. In operational terms, it means that investors in the rich countries can invest their money in countries other than their own, including developing countries, where they might get better return. Globalisation has also led to the flow of ideas across national boundaries. The spread of internet and computer related services is an example of that. Consequences of globalisation are not the same in every country. They may vary. Economic globalisation has created an intense division of opinion all over the world. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. They point out that it is likely to benefit only a small section of the population while impoverishing those who were dependent on the government for job and welfare (education, health, sanitation, etc.) They have emphasised the need to ensure institutional safeguards or creating ‘social safety nets’ to minimise the negative effects of globalisation on those who are economically weak. Advocates of economic globalisation argue that it generates greater economic growth and well-being for larger section of the population when there is de-regulation. They also advocate that economic globalisation is inevitable and it is not wise to resist the march of history. More moderate supporters of globalisation says that globalisation provide a challenge that can be responded to intelligently without accepting it uncritically. Interdependence and integration between governments, business and ordinary people in different parts of the world has increased as a result of globalisation. In 1991, responding to a financial crisis and to the desire for higher rates of economic growth, India embarked on a programme of economic reforms that has sought increasingly to deregulate various sectors including trade and foreign investment. It is not possible to say how good this has been for India, the ultimate test is not high growth rates as making sure that the benefits of growth are shared so that everyone is better off. Q.15. Do you agree with the argument that globalisation leads to cultural heterogeneity? [NCERT] Ans. Yes. Globalisation influence our culture upto an extent. Globalisation affect us in our home, in our home, in what we eat, drink, wear and indeed in what we think. Globalisation leads to the rise of a uniform culture or what is called homogenisation. The rise of a uniform culture is not the evolution of a global culture. This is imposition of Western culture on the rest of the world. US hegemony can be seen on different cultures. The popularity of a burger or blue jeans, some argue, has a lot to do with the powerful effect of the American way of life. Thus, the culture of the politically and economically dominant society leaves its imprint on a less powerful society, and the

What were the types of threats faced by India?,India has faced traditional and non-traditional threats to its security,"mad-cow disease, and bird flu shut down supplies of poultry exports from several Asian countries. Such epidemics show the growing interdependence of states making their borders less meaningful than in the past and emphasise the need for international cooperation. Q.19. Looking at the Indian scenario, what type of security has been given priority in India, traditional or non-traditional? What examples could you cite to substantiate the argument? [NCERT] Ans. India faces both type of security threats, traditional and non-traditional. So, it does not give priority to any threat. It considers both the threats equally dangerous. Arguments: 1. The foremost component was strengthening India’s military capabilities because it has been involved in conflicts with its neighbours-Pakistan in 1947-48, 1965, 1971 and 1991 and China in 1962. Since it is surrounded by nuclear-armed countries in the South Asian region, India’s decision to conduct nuclear tests in 1998 was justified by the Indian government in terms of safeguarding national security. India first tested a nuclear device in 1974. 2. The third component of Indian security strategy is geared towards meeting security challenges within the country. Several militant groups from areas such as the Nagaland, Mizoram, the Punjab and Kashmir among others have, from time to time, sought to break away from India. India has tried to preserve national unityby adopting a democratic political system, which allows different communities and groups of people to freely articulate their grievances and share political power. 3. India’s security strategy has been to strengthen international norms and international institutions to protect its security interests. India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, supported the cause of Asian solidarity, decolonisation, disarmament, and the UN as a forum in which international conflicts could be settled. India also took initiatives to bring about a universal and non-discriminatory non-proliferation regime in which all countries would have the same rights and obligations with respect to weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, biological, chemical). It argued for an equitable New International Economic Order (NIEO). Most importantly, itused non-alignment to help carve out an area of Peace outside the bloc Politics of the two superpowers. India joined 160 countries that have signed and ratified the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which provides a roadmap for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases to check global warming. Indian troops have been sent abroad on UN peacekeeping missions in support of cooperative security initiatives.
 "
When did India first test a nuclear device?,India first tested a nuclear device in 1974. ,"Ans. Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT): This treaty banned nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water. It was signed by the US, UK and USSR in Moscow on 5 August, 1963. It entered into force on 10 October 1963. (i) Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT): This treaty was signed in Washington, London and Moscow on 1 July, 1968 at the same time and came into force on 5 March 1970. This treaty was extended indefinitely in 1995. It states that on 1 January, 1967, America, USSR (later Russia), Britain, France and China are five nuclear weapon states. As a result, it allowed only the nuclear weapon states to have nuclear weapons and stopped others from acquiring them. (ii) Strategic Arms Limitation Talks I (SALT-I): The first round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks began in November 1969 on a high level at America and USSR. After long conversation of two and half years, the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and the US President Richard Nixon signed the following in Moscow: • •

The ‘eastern alliance’ also formed an organisation named ‘Warsaw Pact’ which was led by the Soviet Union. It was created in 1955. Its principal function was to counter NATO’s forces in Europe. Q.5. Explain the role played by India in maintaining Afro–Asian unity. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Role played by India in maintaining Afro–Asian unity: (i) Under the leadership of Nehru, India convened the Asian Relation Conference in March 1947. (ii) India was a staunch supporter of the decolonization process and firmly opposed racism, especially apartheid in South Africa. (iii) India made earnest efforts for the early realization of an international conference in 1949 to support its freedom struggle. (iv) The Afro–Asian conference held in the Indonesian city of Bandung in 1955, commonly known as Bandung Conference, marked the zenith of India’s engagement with newly independent Asian and African nations. (v) The Bandung Conference later led to the establishment of the NAM. (Any four points) Q.6. Explain any four core objectives of non-aligned movement (NAM). [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Four objectives of NAM are as follows: (i) To follow free and independent foreign policies instead of following that of other countries. (ii) To ensure independence of colonies of United Nations and to give support to dependent people on the issue of full authorities, rights and self-decisiveness. (iii) Support to maintain a distance from allied politics and treaties and to follow a free and independent foreign policy by maintaining a distance from both the blocs, America and USSR. (iv) To reduce tension between international relations, to frame a new international economic system based on justice and independence and to ensure appropriate participation of developing countries. Q.7. Clarify the policies of NAM. Ans. The policies of NAM are as follows:
 "
Which protocol has given a road map in order to reduce emission of green house gases?,Kyoto Protocol.,"Protocol in August 2002. India, China and other developing countries were exempted from the requirements of Kyoto Protocol because their contribution to the emission of green-house gases during the industrialisation period was not significant.

What has been reported in the ‘Human Development Report’ of the United Nations?,"According to the Human Development Report 2006 of the United Nations Development Programme, 1.2 billion people in developing countries have no access to clean and safe water and 2.6 billion have no access to sanitation, resulting in the death of more than three million children every year.","3. The rights of colonised people or ethnic and indigenous minorities. Q.11. Write short note on Global Poverty. Ans. Global Poverty is another source of insecurity. World Population - now at 650 crore will reach 700 to 800 crore within 25 years and may eventually level out at 900 to 1000 crore. Currently, half of the World’s population growth occurs in just six countries— India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Among the World’s poorest countries, population is expected to be triple in the next 50 years, whereas many rich countries will see population shrinkage in that period. High per capita income and low population growth make rich states or rich social group get richer, whereas low incomes and high population growth reinforce each other to make poor state and poor groups get poorer.

What is the importance of Natural forests?,Importance of Natural Forests are as follows: 1. Helps to stabilise the climate 2. Mediates water supplies 3. Harbour a majority of the planet’s biodiversity on land 4. Land is saved from getting converted into barren.,"Q.1. Explain any three environmental concerns in global politics. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. Environmental concerns in global politics: (i) Cultivated area in world is limited and there is less scope to expand it. It is also a matter of concern that a substantial portion of existing agricultural land is losing fertility and are over-harvested. (ii) Issues related to access safe water and sanitation is very important. According to UNDP report, 1.2 billion people in developing countries have no access to safe water and 2.6 billion have no access to sanitation. (iii) For ecological balance, natural forests are important environmental concerns in global politics. Ecological degradation may affect climate change and it may affect biodiversity on land. (iv) A steady decline in the total amount of ozone in the earth’s stratosphere poses a real danger to ecosystems and human health. (v) The Coastal waters are becoming increasingly polluted largly due to landbased activities. It may cause deterioration in the quality of marine environment. Q.2. What is meant by ‘Common but differentiated responsibility’? How could we implement the idea? [NCERT] Or ‘States have Common but different responsibilities towards environment’. Substantiate your answer with a suitable example. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Or Explain ‘Common but different responsibilities’. How and where has this been pressurised? [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. On the issue of ‘Environmental Protection’, the developing countries agree that ecological degradation is a product of industrial development undertaken by advanced countries. Thus responsibilities of its compensation should be a priority. This argument
 was accepted in the Rio Declaration at the ‘Earth Summit’ in 1992 and is called the principle of ‘Common but differentiated responsibilities’. The relevant part of the Rio Declaration says that ‘States shall cooperate in the spirit of global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity of Earth’s ecosystem, in view of the different contributions of global environmental deterioration, states have common but differentiated responsibilities. The developedcountries acknowledge the responsibilities that they bear in the international pursuit of sustainable development in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technological and financial resources they command’. The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also provides that the parties should act to protect the climate system on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Q.3. Explain indigenous people and their rights with respect to India. Ans. The indigenous people bring the issues of environment, resources and politics together. The UN defines indigenous populations as comprising the descendants of peoples who inhabited the present territory of a state at the time when persons of a different culture or ethnic origin arrived there from other parts of the world and overpowered them. Indigenous people today live more in conformity with their particular social, economic, and cultural customs and traditions than the institutions of the country of which they now form a part. In the context of the world politics, the common interest of approximately 30 crore indigenous people spread throughout the world including India, like other social movements, indigenous people speak of their struggles, their agenda and their rights. The indigenous voices in the world politics call for the admission of indigenous people to the world community as equals, indigenous people occupy areas in Central and South America, Africa, India and Southeast Asia. In India, the description ‘Indigenous People’ is usually applied to the scheduled tribes, who constitute nearly 8 per cent of the population of the country. With the exception of small communities of hunters and gatherers, most indigenous population in India depend for their subsistence primarily on the cultivation of land. For Centuries, if notmillennia, they had free access to as much land as they could cultivate. It was only after the establishment of the British colonial rule that areas, which had previously been inhabited by the Scheduled Tribe Communities were subjected to outside forces. Although they enjoy a constitutional protection in political representation, they havenot got much of the benefits of development in the country. In fact, they have paid a huge cost for development since they are the single largest group among the people displaced by various development projects since independence.Issues related to the rights of the indigenous communities have been neglected in domestic and international politics for very long. During the 1970s, growing indigenous leaders from around the world aroused the world a sense of common concern and shared experience. The World Council of Indigenous peoples was formed in 1975. The council became subsequently the first of 11 indigenous NGOs to receive consultative status in the UN.
 Q.4. Describe any three steps taken by the Indian Government to check the environmental degradation. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Steps taken by the Indian government to check the Environmental Degradation: (i) National Auto-fuel policy: Indian National Auto Fuel Policy mandates cleaner fuels for vehicles. (ii) Energy Conservation Act: The Energy Conservation Act passed in 2001, outlines initiatives to improve energy efficiency. The Electricity Act of 2003 encourages the use of renewable energy. (iii) National Mission on Biodiesel: The Indian Government is also keen to launch a National Mission on Biodiesel, using about 11 million hectares of land to produce Biodiesel, and India has one of the largest renewable energy programmes in the world. Q.5. Write a note on Sacred Groves in India. Ans. Protecting nature for religious reasons is an ancient practice in many traditional societies, Sacred groves means parcels of uncut forest vegetation, Sacred groves in India are in the name of certain deities or natural ancestral spirits. As a model of community-based resource management, groves have lately gained an attention in conservation towards this. The sacred groves can be seen as a system that informally forces traditional communities to harvest natural resources in an ecologically sustained fashion. Some researches believe that sacred groves hold the potential for preserving not only the biodiversity and ecological functions, but also cultural diversity. Sacred groves represent a rich set of forest preservation practices and they share characteristics with common property resource systems. Their size ranges from clumps of a few trees to several hundred acres. Traditionally, sacred groves have been valued for their embodied spiritual and cultural attribute. Hindus commonly worshiped natural objects, including trees and groves. Many temples have originated from sacred groves.Deep religious admiration and veneration for nature, rather than resource scarcity, seems to be the basis for the long-standing commitment to preserving these forests. In recent years, however, expansion and human settlement have slowly encroached on sacred forests. In many places, the institutional identity of these traditional forests is fading with the advent of new national forest policies. A real problem in managing sacred groves arises when legal ownership and operational control are held by different entities. The two entities mean the states and the community, vary in their policy norms and underlyingmotives for using the sacred groves. Q.6. ‘There is a difference in the approach towards environment between the countries of the North and the South.’ Explain the statement with reference to the Earth Summit (1992) and the Kyoto Protocol (1997)?
 Q.1. What has been reported in the ‘Human Development Report’ of the United Nations? Ans. According to the Human Development Report 2006 of the United Nations Development Programme, 1.2 billion people in developing countries have no access to clean and safe water and 2.6 billion have no access to sanitation, resulting in the death of more than three million children every year. Q.2. What is the importance of Natural forests? Ans. Importance of Natural Forests are as follows: 1. Helps to stabilise the climate 2. Mediates water supplies 3. Harbour a majority of the planet’s biodiversity on land 4. Land is saved from getting converted into barren. Q.3. How does issues of environmental degradation became a part of world politics? [CBSE Delhi 2008] Ans. Issues of environmental degradation became a part of world politics because environment was getting affected due to the economic development. An effective and concerned initiative was to be taken in order to curb the negative effect on environment. Q.4. How do developing countries argue on environmental degradation? Ans. Developing countries argue that most of the contributions in harming our environment is of developed countries. So, the developed countries should take most of the responsibilities in saving environment. Developing countries are reluctant in having mutual consent of responsibilities with developed countries. Q.5. Among which countries were violent struggles seen on water issues? Ans. There was a struggle between Israel, Syria and Jordan in 1950s and 1960s over attempts by each side to divert water from the Jordan and Yarmulke Rivers, and more recent threats between Turkey, Syria, and Iraq over the construction of dam on the Euphrates River. Q.6. Why should ‘environmental degradation issues’ be seen as a part of contemporary world politics?

What is meant by ‘Common but differentiated responsibility’? How could we implement the idea? [NCERT] Or ‘States have Common but different responsibilities towards environment’. Substantiate your answer with a suitable example. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Or Explain ‘Common but different responsibilities’. How and where has this been pressurised? [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. On the issue of ‘Environmental Protection’, the developing countries agree that ecological degradation is a product of industrial development undertaken by advanced countries. Thus responsibilities of its compensation should be a priority. This argument
 [NCERT] Ans. It has become essential to adopt some ways of environment conservation because of environment degradation due to economic development. But this poses a great threat to pace of economic development. It is a serious challenge in front of world to adopt such approach which neither affect or degrade the environment nor slows down the pace of economic development. From state level to international level steps and initiatives have been taken in this direction. Most significant responses to this challenge have come not from the governments but rather from groups of environmentally conscious volunteers working in different part of the world. It is within social movements that new forms of political action are born on reinvented. These movements raise new ideas and long-term visions of what we should do and what we should not do in our individual and collective lives. Here are just a few examples to show that diversity is an important trait of contemporary environmental movements. 1. Movement in Favour of forest: Forest clearing in the Third world countries at an alarming rate, despite three decades of environmental activism. The destruction of the world’s last remaining grand forests has actually increased in last decade. The forest movement of the South, in Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Malaysia, Indonesia, Continental Africa and India, etc. are faced with enormous pressures. 2. Mines Related Movements: The minerals industry is one of the most powerful forms of industry on the planet. A large number of economies of the South are now being reopened to MNCs through the liberalisation of the global economy. The mineral industry’s extraction of earth, its use of chemicals, its pollution of waterways and land, its clearance of native vegetation, its displacements of community, amongst other factors, continue to invite criticism and resistance in various parts of the world. One example is that of the Philippines, where a vast network of groups and organisations campaigned against the Western Mining Corporation (WMC), an Australia-based multinational company. Much opposition to the company in its own country. 3. Dam Opposing Movements: Another groups of movements are those involved in struggles against mega dams. In every country where a mega dam is being built, one is likely to find an environmental movement opposing it. Increasingly antidam movements are pro-river movements for more sustainable and equitablemanagement of river systems and valleys. The early 1980s saw the first anti-dam movement launched in the North, namely, the campaign to save the Franklin River and its surrounding forests in Australia. At present, there has been a spurt in mega- dam building in the South, from Turkey to Thailand to South Africa, from Indonesia to China. India has had some of the leading anti-dam pro river movements. Narmada Bachao Andolan and Tehri movement are examples of such movements. It is significant note that, in anti-dam and other environmental movements in India, the most important shared idea is nonviolence. Q.20. Explain the arguments in favour of India on environment related issues. [CBSE Delhi 2013]
 Or Explain arguments in favour of India on any three issues of environment. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. Arguments in favour of India on issues related to environment are as follows: 1. India signed and ratified the 1997 Kyoto Protocol in August 2002. India, China and other developing countries were exempted from the requirement of the Kyoto Protocol because their contribution to the emission of greenhouse gases during the industrialisation period was not significant. However, at the G-8 meeting in June2005, India pointed out that the per capita emission rates of developing countries are a tiny fraction of those in the developed world. Following the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. India is of the view that the major responsibility of curbing emission rests with the developed countries, which have accumulated emissions over a long period of time. 2. India’s international negotiating position relies heavily on principles of historical responsibility, as enshrined in UNFCCC. This acknowledges that developed countries are responsible for most historical and current greenhouse gas emissions, and emphasizes that economic and socio development are the first and overridingpriorities of the developing country parties’, so India is wary of recent discussions within UNFCCC about introducing binding commitments on speedily industrialising countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. India feels the controversies that very spirit of UNFCCC. Neither does it seem fair to impose restrictions on India when the country’s rise in per capita carbon emission by 2030 is likely to still represent less than half the world average of 3.8 tonnes in 2000. Indian emissions are predicted to rise from 0.9 tonnes per capita in 2000 to 1.6 tonnes per capita in 2030. 3. The Indian government is already participating in global efforts through a number of programmes. For example, India’s National Auto-fuel Policy mandates cleaner fuels for vehicles. The Energy Conservation Act, passed in 2001, outlines initiatives to improve energy efficiency. Similarly, the Electricity Act of 2003 advocates and promotes the use of renewable energy. Recent trends in importing natural gas and encouraging the adoption of clean coal technologies show that India has been making true efforts. The government also intended to launch a National Mission on Biodiesel, using about 11 million hectares of land to produce bio diesel by 2011-12. And India has one of the largest renewable energy programmes in the world. 4. A review of the implementation of the agreements at the Earth Summit in Rio was undertaken by India at 1997. One of the key conclusions was that there had been no meaningful progress with respect to transfer of new and additional financial resources and environmentally sound technology on concessional terms to developing nations. India encourage SAARC countries to adopt a common position on major global environmental issues, so that the region’s voice carries greater weight. Q.21. Compromise and accommodation are the two essential policies required by states to save planet Earth. Substantiate the statement in the light of the ongoing negotiations between the North and South on environmental issues.
 [NCERT] Ans. Issues of environment is not just related to any individual or country, rather it is related to all those people of countries living on Earth. Thus, in order to save it, mutual and cooperative efforts are required instead of individual efforts. It is important that every country adopts the policy of resolvement and cooperation. There is difference in the approach to environment between the countries of the North and the South. The developed countries of the North want to discuss the environmental issue as it stands now and wants everyone to be equally responsible for ecological conservation. The developing countries of the south feel that much of the ecological degradation in the world is the result of industrial development undertaken by the developed countries. If they have caused more degradation, they must also take more responsibility for undoing the damage now. Moreover, the developing countries are in the process of industrialisation and they must not be subjected to the same restrictions, which apply to the developed countries. Thus, the special needs of the developing countries must be taken into consideration in the development, application, and interpretation of rules of international environmental law. This argument was accepted in the Rio Declaration at the Earth Summit in 1992 and is called the principle of Common but differentiated responsibilities. The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also provides that the parties should act to protect the climate system on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities. The parties to the Convention, agreed that the largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries. It was also acknowledged that per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low. China, India, and other developing countries were, therefore, exempted from the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol. Q.22. What are ‘global commons’? Why is it said that international cooperation over the global commons is not easy? [CBSE Delhi 2016] Ans. Global commons are the resources which are not owned by any one country but rather owned by international community such as earth’s atmosphere, Antarctica, the ocean floor and the outer space. It is difficult to achieve consensus on common environmental agenda. History of outer space as global common shows that the management of these areas is influenced by North East inequalities. Like Earth’s atmosphere and the ocean floor, the crucial issue here is technology and development. The benefits of exploitative activities in outer space are far from being equal either for the present or the future.
 2. Similar and cooperative behaviour towards Global Common should be there. Responsibilities are common but roles are different. Thus, role should be played by all. Q.3. What are the reasons for growing concerns about the environment? [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. Environment concern is a very serious issue because of the following facts: (i) Cultivable area throughout the world is decreasing and losing in fertility. (ii) Water bodies getting polluted due to pollution. (iii) Rapid decline in the total amount of ozone in the earth’s stratosphere. (iv) Global coastal pollution has increased due to land based activities. Q.4. Why is mineral industry criticised and opposed in different parts of the world? Ans. Following are the reasons why mineral industry is being criticised and opposed in different parts of world: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.
 The mineral industry’s extraction of earth. Its use of chemicals. Its pollution of waterways and land. Its clearance of native vegetation. Its displacement of communities.
 One example that can be cited is of the Philippines, where a vast network of groups and organisations campaigned against the Western Mining Corporation (WMC), an Australia-based multinational company. Q.5. Explain the role of Environment Movements to meet the challenge of Environmental Degradation. [CBSE Delhi 2016] Ans. Environmental movements meet the challenge of environmental degradation by: (i) Social movements such as the Chipko movement resist the degradation of their surrounding environment and become a popular movement. (ii) They ensure information campaigns in school, colleges and through popular media to highlight issues of environmental degradation. (iii) They pressurise governments to effectively combat climate change such as in Paris negotiations. (iv) These movements began ground campaigns such as cleaning beaches, etc. and thereby involve public participation.
 "
How do developing countries argue on environmental degradation?,"Developing countries argue that most of the contributions in harming our environment is of developed countries. So, the developed countries should take most of the responsibilities in saving environment. Developing countries are reluctant in having mutual consent of responsibilities with developed countries.","was accepted in the Rio Declaration at the ‘Earth Summit’ in 1992 and is called the principle of ‘Common but differentiated responsibilities’. The relevant part of the Rio Declaration says that ‘States shall cooperate in the spirit of global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity of Earth’s ecosystem, in view of the different contributions of global environmental deterioration, states have common but differentiated responsibilities. The developedcountries acknowledge the responsibilities that they bear in the international pursuit of sustainable development in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technological and financial resources they command’. The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also provides that the parties should act to protect the climate system on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Q.3. Explain indigenous people and their rights with respect to India. Ans. The indigenous people bring the issues of environment, resources and politics together. The UN defines indigenous populations as comprising the descendants of peoples who inhabited the present territory of a state at the time when persons of a different culture or ethnic origin arrived there from other parts of the world and overpowered them. Indigenous people today live more in conformity with their particular social, economic, and cultural customs and traditions than the institutions of the country of which they now form a part. In the context of the world politics, the common interest of approximately 30 crore indigenous people spread throughout the world including India, like other social movements, indigenous people speak of their struggles, their agenda and their rights. The indigenous voices in the world politics call for the admission of indigenous people to the world community as equals, indigenous people occupy areas in Central and South America, Africa, India and Southeast Asia. In India, the description ‘Indigenous People’ is usually applied to the scheduled tribes, who constitute nearly 8 per cent of the population of the country. With the exception of small communities of hunters and gatherers, most indigenous population in India depend for their subsistence primarily on the cultivation of land. For Centuries, if notmillennia, they had free access to as much land as they could cultivate. It was only after the establishment of the British colonial rule that areas, which had previously been inhabited by the Scheduled Tribe Communities were subjected to outside forces. Although they enjoy a constitutional protection in political representation, they havenot got much of the benefits of development in the country. In fact, they have paid a huge cost for development since they are the single largest group among the people displaced by various development projects since independence.Issues related to the rights of the indigenous communities have been neglected in domestic and international politics for very long. During the 1970s, growing indigenous leaders from around the world aroused the world a sense of common concern and shared experience. The World Council of Indigenous peoples was formed in 1975. The council became subsequently the first of 11 indigenous NGOs to receive consultative status in the UN.
 Q.4. Describe any three steps taken by the Indian Government to check the environmental degradation. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Steps taken by the Indian government to check the Environmental Degradation: (i) National Auto-fuel policy: Indian National Auto Fuel Policy mandates cleaner fuels for vehicles. (ii) Energy Conservation Act: The Energy Conservation Act passed in 2001, outlines initiatives to improve energy efficiency. The Electricity Act of 2003 encourages the use of renewable energy. (iii) National Mission on Biodiesel: The Indian Government is also keen to launch a National Mission on Biodiesel, using about 11 million hectares of land to produce Biodiesel, and India has one of the largest renewable energy programmes in the world. Q.5. Write a note on Sacred Groves in India. Ans. Protecting nature for religious reasons is an ancient practice in many traditional societies, Sacred groves means parcels of uncut forest vegetation, Sacred groves in India are in the name of certain deities or natural ancestral spirits. As a model of community-based resource management, groves have lately gained an attention in conservation towards this. The sacred groves can be seen as a system that informally forces traditional communities to harvest natural resources in an ecologically sustained fashion. Some researches believe that sacred groves hold the potential for preserving not only the biodiversity and ecological functions, but also cultural diversity. Sacred groves represent a rich set of forest preservation practices and they share characteristics with common property resource systems. Their size ranges from clumps of a few trees to several hundred acres. Traditionally, sacred groves have been valued for their embodied spiritual and cultural attribute. Hindus commonly worshiped natural objects, including trees and groves. Many temples have originated from sacred groves.Deep religious admiration and veneration for nature, rather than resource scarcity, seems to be the basis for the long-standing commitment to preserving these forests. In recent years, however, expansion and human settlement have slowly encroached on sacred forests. In many places, the institutional identity of these traditional forests is fading with the advent of new national forest policies. A real problem in managing sacred groves arises when legal ownership and operational control are held by different entities. The two entities mean the states and the community, vary in their policy norms and underlyingmotives for using the sacred groves. Q.6. ‘There is a difference in the approach towards environment between the countries of the North and the South.’ Explain the statement with reference to the Earth Summit (1992) and the Kyoto Protocol (1997)?
 [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. The Global south believes that global north is responsible for much of the environmental degradation as most of the developments and industrialisation have taken place in the north only. Their contention is that they are still on the path of development and, therefore, should not be subjected to the same restrictions. Countries of the north havea larger responsibility of ecological conservation. This principle was accepted at the Rio Summit 1992 and is popularly called ‘common but differentiated responsibility’. The Kyoto Protocol, which is based on the principles of UNFCCC 1992, also sets targets for industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Q.7. What is resource geopolitics? Explain with an example. Ans. Resource geopolitics is all about who get what, when, where and how one gets the resources? Resources have provided some of the key means and motives of global European power expansion. They have also been the focus of inter-state rivalry. Western geopolitical thinking about resources has been dominated by the relationship of trade, was and power at the core of which were overseas resources and maritime navigation. Since sea power itself is rested on access to timber, naval timber supply became a key priority for major European powers from the 17th century onwards. The critical importance of ensuring uninterrupted supply of strategic resources, in particular oil, was well established during both the First World War and the Second World War. Throughout the cold war, the industrialised countries of the north adopted a number of methods to ensure a steady flow of resources. These included the deployment of military forces near exploitation sites and along sea-lanes of communication, the stockpiling of strategic resources, efforts to prop up friendly governments in producing countries, as well as support to multinational companies and favourable international agreements. Traditional western strategic thinking remained concerned with access to supplies, which might be threatened by the Soviet Union. A particular concern was western control of oil in the gulf and strategic minerals in Southern and Central Africa. After the end of the cold war and the fragmentation of the Soviet Union, the security of supply continues to worry government and business decision with regard to several minerals, in particular, radioactive materials. However, oil continues to be the most important resource in the global strategy. The global economy relied on oil for much of the 20th century as a portable and imperative fuel. The immense wealth associated with oil generates political struggles to control it, and the history of petroleum is also the history of war and struggle. Now here is this more obviously the case than in West Asia and Central Asia. West Asia, specifically the Gulf region, accounts for about 30 per cent of global oil production. But it has about 64 per cent of the planet’s known resources and it therefore the only region able to satisfy any substantial rise in oil demand. Saudi Arabia has a quarter of the world’s total reserves and it is single largest producer. Iraq’s known resources are second only to Saudi Arabia’s. And since substantial portions of Iraqi territory are yet to be fully explored, there is a fair chance that actual reserve might be far larger. The United States, Europe, Japan and increasingly India and China, which
 Or Explain arguments in favour of India on any three issues of environment. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. Arguments in favour of India on issues related to environment are as follows: 1. India signed and ratified the 1997 Kyoto Protocol in August 2002. India, China and other developing countries were exempted from the requirement of the Kyoto Protocol because their contribution to the emission of greenhouse gases during the industrialisation period was not significant. However, at the G-8 meeting in June2005, India pointed out that the per capita emission rates of developing countries are a tiny fraction of those in the developed world. Following the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. India is of the view that the major responsibility of curbing emission rests with the developed countries, which have accumulated emissions over a long period of time. 2. India’s international negotiating position relies heavily on principles of historical responsibility, as enshrined in UNFCCC. This acknowledges that developed countries are responsible for most historical and current greenhouse gas emissions, and emphasizes that economic and socio development are the first and overridingpriorities of the developing country parties’, so India is wary of recent discussions within UNFCCC about introducing binding commitments on speedily industrialising countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. India feels the controversies that very spirit of UNFCCC. Neither does it seem fair to impose restrictions on India when the country’s rise in per capita carbon emission by 2030 is likely to still represent less than half the world average of 3.8 tonnes in 2000. Indian emissions are predicted to rise from 0.9 tonnes per capita in 2000 to 1.6 tonnes per capita in 2030. 3. The Indian government is already participating in global efforts through a number of programmes. For example, India’s National Auto-fuel Policy mandates cleaner fuels for vehicles. The Energy Conservation Act, passed in 2001, outlines initiatives to improve energy efficiency. Similarly, the Electricity Act of 2003 advocates and promotes the use of renewable energy. Recent trends in importing natural gas and encouraging the adoption of clean coal technologies show that India has been making true efforts. The government also intended to launch a National Mission on Biodiesel, using about 11 million hectares of land to produce bio diesel by 2011-12. And India has one of the largest renewable energy programmes in the world. 4. A review of the implementation of the agreements at the Earth Summit in Rio was undertaken by India at 1997. One of the key conclusions was that there had been no meaningful progress with respect to transfer of new and additional financial resources and environmentally sound technology on concessional terms to developing nations. India encourage SAARC countries to adopt a common position on major global environmental issues, so that the region’s voice carries greater weight. Q.21. Compromise and accommodation are the two essential policies required by states to save planet Earth. Substantiate the statement in the light of the ongoing negotiations between the North and South on environmental issues.

Why should ‘environmental degradation issues’ be seen as a part of contemporary world politics? ,"At present, most of the steps to check environmental degradation are such that no single government can address them fully. Therefore, they have to become part of world politics. They fall within the scope of contemporary world politics.","Q.1. Explain any three environmental concerns in global politics. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. Environmental concerns in global politics: (i) Cultivated area in world is limited and there is less scope to expand it. It is also a matter of concern that a substantial portion of existing agricultural land is losing fertility and are over-harvested. (ii) Issues related to access safe water and sanitation is very important. According to UNDP report, 1.2 billion people in developing countries have no access to safe water and 2.6 billion have no access to sanitation. (iii) For ecological balance, natural forests are important environmental concerns in global politics. Ecological degradation may affect climate change and it may affect biodiversity on land. (iv) A steady decline in the total amount of ozone in the earth’s stratosphere poses a real danger to ecosystems and human health. (v) The Coastal waters are becoming increasingly polluted largly due to landbased activities. It may cause deterioration in the quality of marine environment. Q.2. What is meant by ‘Common but differentiated responsibility’? How could we implement the idea? [NCERT] Or ‘States have Common but different responsibilities towards environment’. Substantiate your answer with a suitable example. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Or Explain ‘Common but different responsibilities’. How and where has this been pressurised? [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. On the issue of ‘Environmental Protection’, the developing countries agree that ecological degradation is a product of industrial development undertaken by advanced countries. Thus responsibilities of its compensation should be a priority. This argument
 [NCERT] Ans. It has become essential to adopt some ways of environment conservation because of environment degradation due to economic development. But this poses a great threat to pace of economic development. It is a serious challenge in front of world to adopt such approach which neither affect or degrade the environment nor slows down the pace of economic development. From state level to international level steps and initiatives have been taken in this direction. Most significant responses to this challenge have come not from the governments but rather from groups of environmentally conscious volunteers working in different part of the world. It is within social movements that new forms of political action are born on reinvented. These movements raise new ideas and long-term visions of what we should do and what we should not do in our individual and collective lives. Here are just a few examples to show that diversity is an important trait of contemporary environmental movements. 1. Movement in Favour of forest: Forest clearing in the Third world countries at an alarming rate, despite three decades of environmental activism. The destruction of the world’s last remaining grand forests has actually increased in last decade. The forest movement of the South, in Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Malaysia, Indonesia, Continental Africa and India, etc. are faced with enormous pressures. 2. Mines Related Movements: The minerals industry is one of the most powerful forms of industry on the planet. A large number of economies of the South are now being reopened to MNCs through the liberalisation of the global economy. The mineral industry’s extraction of earth, its use of chemicals, its pollution of waterways and land, its clearance of native vegetation, its displacements of community, amongst other factors, continue to invite criticism and resistance in various parts of the world. One example is that of the Philippines, where a vast network of groups and organisations campaigned against the Western Mining Corporation (WMC), an Australia-based multinational company. Much opposition to the company in its own country. 3. Dam Opposing Movements: Another groups of movements are those involved in struggles against mega dams. In every country where a mega dam is being built, one is likely to find an environmental movement opposing it. Increasingly antidam movements are pro-river movements for more sustainable and equitablemanagement of river systems and valleys. The early 1980s saw the first anti-dam movement launched in the North, namely, the campaign to save the Franklin River and its surrounding forests in Australia. At present, there has been a spurt in mega- dam building in the South, from Turkey to Thailand to South Africa, from Indonesia to China. India has had some of the leading anti-dam pro river movements. Narmada Bachao Andolan and Tehri movement are examples of such movements. It is significant note that, in anti-dam and other environmental movements in India, the most important shared idea is nonviolence. Q.20.

Q.5. Write a note on Sacred Groves in India. Ans. Protecting nature for religious reasons is an ancient practice in many traditional societies, Sacred groves means parcels of uncut forest vegetation, Sacred groves in India are in the name of certain deities or natural ancestral spirits. As a model of community-based resource management, groves have lately gained an attention in conservation towards this. The sacred groves can be seen as a system that informally forces traditional communities to harvest natural resources in an ecologically sustained fashion. Some researches believe that sacred groves hold the potential for preserving not only the biodiversity and ecological functions, but also cultural diversity. Sacred groves represent a rich set of forest preservation practices and they share characteristics with common property resource systems. Their size ranges from clumps of a few trees to several hundred acres. Traditionally, sacred groves have been valued for their embodied spiritual and cultural attribute. Hindus commonly worshiped natural objects, including trees and groves. Many temples have originated from sacred groves.Deep religious admiration and veneration for nature, rather than resource scarcity, seems to be the basis for the long-standing commitment to preserving these forests. In recent years, however, expansion and human settlement have slowly encroached on sacred forests. In many places, the institutional identity of these traditional forests is fading with the advent of new national forest policies. A real problem in managing sacred groves arises when legal ownership and operational control are held by different entities. The two entities mean the states and the community, vary in their policy norms and underlyingmotives for using the sacred groves.

Why did India not support any of the two blocs during the Cold War? ,"India did not get involved in any of the blocs to save its sovereignty. At that time, India needed economic development, regional unity and integrity rather than politics. India didn’t want any kind of obstacle in its development by supporting any of the blocs. To summarise, India wanted its overall development by staying away from any alignment.","Its closeness with US will affect its relations with other smaller and bigger powers around its region and in the world due to various reasons. India should instead lead a coalition of countries from the developing world. India should focus on its own national interest and development, on removal of its internal and external challenges and work towards making itself safe, secure and prosperous without depending on any external power. Hegemony is a temporary entity; it does not last forever. Balance of power politics over time reduces the relative power of the hegemony. India has to decide and adopt a mix of foreign policy strategies to deal with the US.

(i) End of the Cold War: Disintegration of Soviet Union led to end of the Cold War confrontations. The ideological dispute over, whether the socialist system would beat the capitalist system was not an issue anymore. (ii) End of Massive Arms Race: Cold War with Ideological dispute had engaged the military of two blocs, had triggered a massive arms race and accumulation of nuclear weapons, and had led to the existence of military blocs. The end of the confrontation brought a ray of hope to that there will be an end to this arms race and peace would be established. (iii) Unipolar System: The possibility of disintegration of Soviet Union was expressed as either unipolar international politics with the domination of remaining one superpower on the rapidly changing international stage or European Union, SAARC, ASEAN, etc., could become important players in the international system,thereby bringing in a multipolar system where no one power could dominate. As it turned out, the US became the sole superpower.
 (iv) Emergence of New Countries: The end of the soviet bloc meant the emergence of many new countries. All these countries had their own independent aspirations and choices.

The Central Asian Countries wanted to take advantage of their geographical location and continue their close ties with Russia and also to establish ties with the West, the US, China and other. Thus, the international stage showed many new players emerge, each with its own identity, interest and economic and political difficulties. (v) Supremacy of Capitalist Ideology: This was already proved after the disintegration of Soviet Union and conflict between Capitalist and communist ideology was over. India learnt a lesson and released its faith in the mixed economy in 1991. India started following liberal and global policies. Institutions like World Bank and International Monetary Fund were considered as country’s prime counsellor. (vi) Emergence of Single Superpower: India had successfully maintained its relationwith America and Soviet Union under the policy of non-alignment. Such stand supported India after the disintegration of Soviet Union and it started improving its relation with the United States. The US also welcomed India’s efforts. Q.10. If the Soviet Union had not disintegrated and the world had remained bipolar, how would that situation had affected the world politics? [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. If the Soviet Union had not disintegrated, it would definitely had affected the following developments. (i) Cold War confrontations would not have ended and USA would not have become the only superpower of the World. (ii) Most of the countries which were part of erstwhile USSR would have never got the independence. (iii) Accumulation of nuclear weapons would have continued endlessly.

"In spite of being a major threat to international peace and security, nuclear weapons did play an important role in deterring the outbreak of III World war during the cold war period. Comment. ",Nuclear weapons played an important role in deterring III World War because of the fear of mutually assured destruction.,"[CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. 1. In the traditional conception of security, the greatest danger to a country is from military threats. The source of this danger is another country which by threatening military action endangers the core values of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. 2. Military action also endangers the lives of ordinary citizens. Q.10. What is the viewpoint of world towards war under traditional concept of security? Ans. It is now an almost universally accepted view that countries should only go to war for the right reasons, primarily self-defence or to protect other people from genocide. War must also be limited in terms of the means that are used. Armies must avoid killing or hurting non-combatants as well as unarmed and surrendering combatants. They should not be excessively violent. Force must in any case be used only after all the alternatives have failed. Q.11. What is meant by non-traditional notion of security? Differentiate between the narrow and the broad concept of human security. [CBSE (AI) 2016] Ans. Non-traditional notion of security are non-military threats such human security, climate change, environmental security, economic security, pandemics, social issues, etc. Human security is the combination of threats associated with war, genocide, and the displacement of populations. Human security in simple terms means freedom fromwant and ‘freedom from fear’. The narrow concept of human security includes security from violence that’s occurs from wars and armed conflicts. The broader concept of human security includes safety from economic, pandemic, environmental and social conflicts and unrests. Kofi Annan puts it as the protection of communities and individuals from internal violence. Q.12. What is the difference between traditional and non-traditional security? Which category would the creation and sustenance of alliances belong to? [NCERT] Or What are the differences between policies traditional and non-traditional security? [CBSE Delhi 2014, 2015] Ans. There are two policies of security: 1. Traditional policy 2. Non-traditional policy.
 Following are the differences between them: Traditional policy 1. There are more changes of military attack. 2. Ordinary men and women are madetargets of war along with the soldiers. 3. Only military comes under threat. 4. It is concerned with preventingwar, balance of power and formingalliances.
 Non-traditional policy 1. Non-traditional notions of securitygo beyond military threats to includea wide range of threats and dangersaffecting the conditions of humanexistence. 2. Whole human existence comesunder threat. 3. Threat involves epidemic, famineand natural calamity. 4. Countries are expected to increasemutual cooperation.
 (ii) Use of Atom Bombs by USA against Japan. (iii) Ideological rivalry between the two super powers. (iv) The two super powers were keen on expanding their spheres. (v) Use of Nuclear power raised many questions and comments like why did USA drop Bombs? (vi) Bombing the two cities of Japan. Q.24. Sometimes it is said that the cold war was simple struggle for power and that any ideology had nothing to do with it. Do you agree with this? Give an example to support your position. [NCERT] Ans. No, I don’t agree with this statement. It wasn’t only the struggle to lead between two blocs that formed as result of Second World War but also the ideological conflicts between them that continued. The ideological conflicts were regarding the most appropriate principal to maintain political, economical and social stability in the whole world – whether communism or Capitalism? The leader of western alliance was America and supported Capitalism. Soviet Union was the leader of Eastern alliance which was committed to ideology of communism. After the disintegration of Soviet Union, importance of one ideology ended and cold war also finished. Q.25. What was the foreign policy of India towards America and USSR during the Cold War? Do you agree that this policy had benefitted India? Ans. India was a British Colony when Cold War had started but when India became independent on 15 August, 1947 then it very judiciously and aptly framed the foreign policies by which could benefit India. Although, it didn’t involve itself in blocs of America and Soviet Union by adopting non-alignment policy but always tried to maintain good relationships with America and Soviet Union.India – Soviet Union Relationship: The relationships of India with Soviet Union have always been cordial. Nehru was always inclined towards Soviet Union. The relations were not noticeable in the period of Stalin and Nehru opted non-alignment policy after independence. There was a gap in relations. When P.S. Menan went as an ambassador in Soviet Union, then the relations started improving. India – Soviet relations deepened during Khrushchev’s period (1954-64). But when India didn’t support Soviet Union’s interference in Hungary in 1956, the relations were affected. Soviet – China conflict strengthened India – Soviet relations because China had attacked India in 1962. Allies treaty was signed between Soviet Union and India at the time of Bangladesh crises. Soviet Union provided India its diplomatic and military support. After that, relations were strengthened from 1971 to 1975. The relations were as it is during the period of Morarji Desai’s tenure as Prime Minister in 1977.
 Soviet Union provided military assistance and also provided technology. India got MiG16, MiG-32, Helicopter and N-12 and A-N 32 cargo ships from Soviet Union and help to Soviet Union when Soviet Union had to interfere Afghanistan with military force in 1979, India gave its full assistance to Soviet Union. ‘India’s Festival’ was organised in Soviet Union many times. Disintegration of Soviet Union occurred till 1990 and India – Soviet relation turned into India – Russia relationship. In 2010, visit to India by Prime Minister Putin and President Medvedev played an important role in strengthening bilateral relationships between India and Russia. India–America Relationship: There was a reluctance in Indian–American relations from the beginning. America was the country which pressurised Britain to free India but after independence, India decided to remain non-aligned and didn’t get involved in any of the blocs. This wasn’t acceptable to America and this resulted in economical and military support to our opposing & neighbouring country, Pakistan. Nehru’s visit to America improved relations in 1957. When America supported Pakistan in Indo–Pak War, the threads of relationships were loosened again. In 1977, the atomic treaty to supply Urenium for Tarapur Nuclear Centre by America in the period of Janta Party was not followed. India refused President Jimmy Carter to sign ‘Nuclear non-proliferation treaty’. America’s continuous act of providing weapons to Pakistan against India prohibited cordial relations during Indira Gandhi tenure as P.M. But India-America relations improved when Rajiv Gandhi’s became the Prime Minister. It continued to be cordial during the period of Bill Clinton’s tenure as President. When World Trade Centre was attacked in 2001, America could realise India’s pain and both the countries could establish ideological unification against terrorism and Indo-American relationship improved. In November 2011, India’s visit by America’s President Obama provided structural strength to India–America long term strategic relationship. Effect of India’s foreign policies on its interests: As a leaders of NAM, India’s response to ongoing Cold War was two-fold – at one level, it took particular case in staying away from two alliances, second, it raised its voice against the newly decolonised countries becoming part of these alliances. India tried to remove the conflicts between both thealliances and tried to establish world peace. However, it also gave its contribution to newly independent countries. A non-aligned posture also served India’s interest very directly, in at least two ways: (i) Non-alignment allowed India to take international decisions and stances that served its interests rather than the interests of superpowers and their allies.

After the Second World War, two new power rose on the global stage. With the defeat of Germany and Japan, the devastation of Europe and in many other parts of the world, the United States and USSR became the greatest powers in the world with the ability to influence events anywhere on earth. The two superpowers were keen on expanding their sphere of influence in different parts of the world. The world was visibly divided between the two alliance systems. Q.9. What was the Chief reason behind the Cold War? Ans. The superpowers emerged in the world after the Second World War. Both the countries wanted to take over the lead and this was the major cause for the Cold War.

A foreign policy which aimed at stopping the promotion of communism in these countries was determined. Q.11. What were the reasons of starting/beginning of NAM? Ans. The whole world was divided into two camps after the Second World War and there was a competition between the superpowers to lead in weapons. Some newly independent countries wanted to maintain their independent existence by not involving in any of the blocs. That’s why, they got united and adopted the policy of non-alignment. As time passed by, other countries also started joining them. Q.12. What challenges did the countries of non-aligned movement face? Ans. Maximum countries involved in NAM were newly independent countries and thus they had to face two challenges: (i) To develop their countries economically (ii) To eliminate widespread poverty in the country.

 Q.15. Why didn’t Cold War turn into bloody war in spite of rivalry between both the superpowers? Ans. Both the superpowers, America and Soviet Union had the capacity to completely destroy each other as they had enough nuclear weapons. This situation of ‘deterrence’ forced both the superpowers and then supporting countries to behave rationally and responsibly. They reacted like this because both of them knew the real consequences of war. Direct war could be highly destructive. Thus, the relation between both of them had deterrence relation.

(iii) Indian would have become a superpower in Asia because of her large territory, human resource and strategic location. Q.17. Why did smaller countries decide to link themselves with any of the superpowers? Ans. Two Superpowers were keen on expanding their spheres of influence in different parts of the world. The world was sharply divided between the two alliance systems, a state was supposed to remain tied to its protective superpower to limit the influence of the other superpower and its allies. The smaller states in the alliances used the link to the superpowers for their own purposes. They got the promise of protection, weapons and economic aid against their local rivals (mostly they had rivalries). For these reasons, smaller states decided to join hands with these superpowers. Q.18. What was India’s own benefit in Non-Alignment Policy? Ans. A non-aligned stand served India’s interests in two ways: (i) Non-alignment allowed India to take international decisions and stances that served its interests rather than the interests of the super powers and their allies.

India played an important and creative role in the Cold war [1945-1990]. The credit of initiating and acting as a bridge in between both opposing camps during Cold war goes to first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru: This active and healthy foreign policy aimed at enhancing both; peace at global level and national interest. This movement also takes decision of international affairs on the basis of the merits and demerits by staying away from treaties of both the military alliances. This movement started at the international platform at Bandung summit in 1955 for the first time. Jawaharlal Nehru also played an important role in this matter. It was due to his initiative that Communist China was included at an international summit for the first time. Soon, India’s Jawaharlal Nehru, Yugoslavia’s Tito and Egypt’s Nasir were known as its spokesperson. It was due to Indians, initiative that prohibition on Nuclear weapons, imperialism and discrimination on the basis of colour was strongly opposed in Bandung summit.

The war that existed between capitalist system and communist system for years came to an end. Superiority of capitalist economy was proved in comparison to communist economy. That’s why, India should try to focus on itsfriendship with America along with some modifications in its foreign policies. India’s non-alignment policy can’t be continued as there’s only a single superpower in the world. When India struggled for independence, it was USA only which pressurised Britain’s government to grant independence to India. When nonalignment policy of India came into existence, Indo-US relations became bitter. Their relations again became cordial after the end of the Cold War. India and US came closer during Clinton’s visit to India in March 2000 and Atal Bihari Vajpayi’s visit to America in September 2000. America helped Pakistan during Kargil War in November 1998. Terrorist attacks in America on11 September, 2001 gave a new direction to Indo-US relations. America wants its own benefits by establishing trade relations with India. India being considerate about its benefits, should maintain trade relations with US. It should use world’s superpower for its benefits. Q.11. Mention three ways in which US dominance since the Cold War is different from its position as a superpower during the Cold War. [NCERT] Ans. In 1991, the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union marked the ending of the Cold War. Hegemony of a sole superpower emerged in place of two superpowers. Beginning of US hegemony was not marked in 1991, rather it started in 1945, after the end of the Second World War. But the process of showing hegemony in realistic manner and strength started in 1991. Following are the three points that show the ways in which US dominance since the Cold War is different from its position as a superpower during the Cold War. (i) Operation Desert Storm: In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, rapidly occupying and subsequently annexing it. After a series of diplomatic attempts failing at convincing Iraq to quit its aggression, the United Nations mandated the liberation of Kuwait by force. This was termed as ‘New World Order’. A massive coalition force of 6,60,000 troops from 34 countries fought against Iraq. However, the UN operation was overwhelmingly American, as nearly 75 per cent of the coalition forces were from US and the military general was also American. This war revealed the vast technological gap that had opened up between the US military capability and that of other states. It was made clear that no country can match US and thus, US hegemony was established in the world. (ii) Action Against Yugoslavia: America took military actions against Yugoslavia during Clinton’s tenure in 1999. It was an important episode occurred in 1999, in response to Yugoslavian action against the predominantly Albanian population in the province of Kosovo. The air forces of the NATO countries, led by the US, bombarded

Mikhail Gorbachev became president of Soviet Union in 1985. Reforms were necessary to keep the USSR abreast of the information and technological revolutions taking place in West. To resolve this situation, he introduced reform policies of ‘perestroika’ (restructuring) and ‘glasnost’ (openness); However Gorbachev’s decision to normaliserelations with the West and democratise and reforms the Soviet Union had some other effects that neither he nor anyone else intended or anticipated. The people in the East European countries, which were earlier the part of the Soviet bloc started to protest against their own governments and Soviet control. Unlike in the past, the Soviet Union, under Gorbachev, did not intervene when the disturbances occurred and the communist regimes collapsed one after another. These developments were accompanied by a rapidly escalating crisis within the USSR that hastened its disintegration. Gorbachev initiated the policies of economic and political reform and democratisation within the country. The reforms were opposed by leaders within the communist party. This increased the speed of disintegration of Soviet Union. The effect of ‘Glasnost’ (openness) policy first took place in Lithuania. Movement for the freedom from USSR began. Soon it spread to Estonia and Latvia. But Gorbachev took the favour of Glasnost instead resolving the matter. In October 1989, he declared that Warsaw pact members were free to decide their own future. In the next month, November 1989, citizens of Germany toppled the Berlin Wall. In February 1990, elections held at Soviet Parliament (Duma). Gorbachev stripped the Soviet Communist Party of its 72 years old monopoly owned power by calling on the Soviet Parliament (Duma) to permit multiparty politics. It had surprising consequences. The communist party which ruled for last 72 years lost the elections. Lithunia declared its independence in March 1990. Russian Parliament declared its independence from Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin played an important role in this process. This was the most deepest indication of disintegration of Soviet Union. The public revolt that occurred to remove of communist party in all the republics of Soviet Union after falling of Berlin Wall in 1989 was so powerful that it wasn’t possible to resolve it with the help of military force. In December 1991, under the leadership of Yeltsin, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, three major republics of the USSR, declared that the Soviet Union was disbanded. And in this way, Soviet Union was disintegrated. Q.7. Explain how did the Cuban Missile Crisis drive the world on the brink of a nuclear war? [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. (i) In April 1961, the USSR was worried that USA would attack Cuba and overthrow the government of Fidel Castro. Therefore, the leaders of Cuba decided to convert the country into a Russian base. (ii) Consequently, the USSR placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. This strategic move put the USA for the first time, under the fire from close range.
 (iii) This move of the USSR made the Americans aware of an imminent danger. The US president J.F. Kennedy was determined to get Nikita Khrushchev to remove the missiles and nuclear weapons from Cuba. (iv) The American warships were ordered to intercept the Soviet ships heading towards Cuba. The overall situation became tense and volatile. (v)The prospects of this clash made the whole world nervous, for it would have been no ordinary war. The Cuban Missile Crisis was a high point of what came to be known as the Cold War. Q.8. How did the Soviet Union suddenly disintegrate? Explain any six reasons. [CBSE (AI) 2016] Or Describe any six factors responsible for the disintegration of USSR. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. Political leaders and ideologists have different methology on the subject of reasons of disintegration of Soviet Union. Soviet Union was disintegrated due to the following reasons: 1. Leaders of Soviet Union guaranteed respected standard of living after Soviet revolution to common citizens, who were unable to manage square meals during bureaucratic and authoritarian system at the time of establishment of Soviet System. There was an improvement in the standard of living of Soviet citizens afterrevolution undoubtedly. But the reforms couldn’t bring out the improvements to an appropriate level, which raised dissatisfaction among citizens. 2. Communist party had a complete control over Soviet Union. Party failed to accomplish/fulfill the aspirations of public. Public of republics felt neglected and suppressed under the domination of Russia. 3. Soviet Union emerged as a superpower after the Second World War. Due to this, the other superpower, America had to compete. Arms race began after the formation of Soviet Union. It emerged as an atomic power in 1948-49. Ths US progressed continuously and consistently whereas Soviet Union’s resources were wasted in the competition. This affected the development and improvement of economic life of people. 4. Some people believed that Soviet Union had dominated Eastern Europe after the Second World War. Soviet Union had to opt a policy for the development of those countries by sparing a large part of its economic equipments in order to gain an effective control on them. 5. Communist party was the only party that ruled for 72 years after the revolution of 1917. Due to this, the party members became bureaucrats. They were not answerable to citizens. Furthermore, the standard of living of members and

When did Cold War begin?,Cold War began after the end of the Second World War.,"Q.1. What were the reasons of emergence of Cold War? Explain any two. Ans. Difference in Opinions: Britain and France were no longer superpowers after Second World War. Two new blocs, Soviet Union and America originated that led capitalism and communal ideology, Russia wanted to spread communism and Socialism whereas America wanted to stop that. After Second World War, Eastern Europe came under the influence of communism under the direction of Soviet Union. Communism was spread not only in Germany, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, etc. but also in Northern Korea in Asia and up to China. This put America under fire. This led to difference in opinions between both the states to a large extent. This gave rise in the bitterness in relationship between both the countries to such an extent that both had suspected view points for each other. Distrust in their relationships led to the beginning of Cold War. Truman Policy: American President, Truman made a programme to help states of Western Europe to stop the influence of USSR. Truman felt that communism spreads only when the people are poor and victim. It can be stopped by providing financial help to the weaker section to make them prosper. In the year 1947, American StateSecretary, Marshal prepared a plan to provide million dollars financial assistance to Europe so that the losses done by war can be compensated. Had this not been done by America then all of these would have become a part of Soviet Union. The Western European countries were now capable to protect themselves from this. At that particular time in interference of Soviet helped these American countries who opposed communalism and determined to keep them integrated. Q.2. What do you mean by Cold War?

American President, John F Kennedy ordered his army to get prepared and asked Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev to remove the missiles. When Soviet warships with missiles headed towards Cuba, then world experienced the fear of first nuclear war between the two superpowers. Khrushchev said, “If president ensures that America would not attack on Cuba and would raise the besiegement, then no issue of missiles in Cuba would be there. We should not stretch those ends of rope where there are knots of war because the more we stretch, the more tighten the knot becomes.” American President Kennedy accepted proposal of Khrushchev and removed missiles and Russia removed missiles and sent them back to USSR. This was the end of that nuclear war which never took place. The close relationship between USA and USSR was developed after the end of crises.

Cold War did not eliminate rivalries between the two alliances, mutual suspicions led them to arm themselves to the teeth and to constantly prepare for war. Huge stock of arms was considered necessary for the prevention of occurrence of war. Q.8. What were the changes in Global politics after the Second World War? Ans. After the Second World War, two new power rose on the global stage. With the defeat of Germany and Japan, the devastation of Europe and in many other parts of the world, the United States and USSR became the greatest powers in the world with the ability to influence events anywhere on earth. The two superpowers were keen on expanding their sphere of influence in different parts of the world. The world was visibly divided between the two alliance systems. Q.9. What was the Chief reason behind the Cold War? Ans. The superpowers emerged in the world after the Second World War. Both the countries wanted to take over the lead and this was the major cause for the Cold War.
 Both the superpowers had strong nuclear weapons. Both could have harmed each other in the case of a war. Q.10. What was the position of America in terms of global politics after the Second World War? Ans. America was a strong country after the Second World War. It had created its position as a superpower in global politics. Another superpower of the world was Soviet Union, who promoted communism. America established ‘North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’ by forming western alliance into an organisation in 1949. A foreign policy which aimed at stopping the promotion of communism in these countries was determined. Q.11. What were the reasons of starting/beginning of NAM? Ans. The whole world was divided into two camps after the Second World War and there was a competition between the superpowers to lead in weapons. Some newly independent countries wanted to maintain their independent existence by not involving in any of the blocs. That’s why, they got united and adopted the policy of non-alignment. As time passed by, other countries also started joining them. Q.12. What challenges did the countries of non-aligned movement face? Ans. Maximum countries involved in NAM were newly independent countries and thus they had to face two challenges: (i) To develop their countries economically (ii) To eliminate widespread poverty in the country. Q.13. Clarify the role played by non-aligned countries in reducing cold war conflicts and averting grave crises. Ans. The non-aligned countries played a very important role in reducing Cold War conflicts and averting some grave crises. Their contribution cannot be ignored. Jawaharlal Nehru – One of the key leaders of the NAM – played a crucial role in mediating between the two Koreas. In the Congo Crisis, the UN Secretary – General played a key mediatory role. Q.14. What was India’s response to the ongoing Cold War in two folds as the leader of NAM? Ans. As a leader of NAM, India’s response to the ongoing Cold War was two-fold: (i) It strongly and vigilantly stayed away from the two alliances. (ii) It raised its voice against the newly decolonised countries becoming a part of these alliances.
 Ans. Yes, I agree that non alignment policy should not be equated with the policy of isolation because firstly, non alignment allows a country to maintain equidistant relations with super powers. Secondly, the policy of keeping away from alliances cannot be termed as ‘isolationism.’ ‘neutrality’. Non-Alignment is not isolationism. Isolationism means to keep aloof from global affairs. Isolationism was part of US foreign policy after the American War of Independence (1787) till the origin of First World War. In contrast non-aligned countries including India have played an active and vibrant role in mediating the cause of peace and stability between the two cold war rivals. Their strength stemmed from the need to remain united and their resolve to pursue nonalignment despite the attempt by the two hostile camps to take these countries in their alliance system. Q.22. The Cold War gave birth to the processes, accumulation of weapons and control of weapons. What were the reasons behind these processes? [NCERT] Ans. old War began in the world after 1945. During Cold War, both the superpowers tried to gain lead in terms of weapons and powers. The alliance systems led by the two superpowers, therefore, threatened to divide the entire world into two camps. This division happened first in Europe. Most countries of Western Europe sided with the US and those of Eastern Europe joined the Soviet Camp. That is why these were also called the (western) and the (eastern) alliances. The western alliance was formalised into an organisation, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), which came into existence in April 1949. It was an association of 12 states which declared that armed attack on any one of them in Europe or North America would be regarded as an attack on all of them. Each of these states would be obliged to help the other. The eastern alliance, known as the ‘Warsaw Pact’, was led by Soviet Union. It was created in 1955 and its principal function was to counter NATO’s forces in Europe. On the initiative of Non-alliance Nations, US and USSR decided to collaborate in limiting or eliminating certain kinds of nuclear and non-nuclear weapons. A stable balance of weapons, they decided, could be maintained through ‘arms control’. Starting in the 1960s, the two sides signed three significant agreements within a decade. There were the Limited Test Ban Treaty, Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty and Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Thereafter, the superpowers held several rounds of arms limitation talks and signed several more treaties to limit their arms. Q.23. Why was the end of the Second World War considered to be the beginning of Cold War? Explain. [CBSE (AI) 2016] Ans. Factors responsible for the beginning of Cold War.

With whom did India sign the treaty of friendship in 1971?,"India signed the treaty of friendship with USSR in August, 1971.","Soviet Union provided military assistance and also provided technology. India got MiG16, MiG-32, Helicopter and N-12 and A-N 32 cargo ships from Soviet Union and help to Soviet Union when Soviet Union had to interfere Afghanistan with military force in 1979, India gave its full assistance to Soviet Union. ‘India’s Festival’ was organised in Soviet Union many times. Disintegration of Soviet Union occurred till 1990 and India – Soviet relation turned into India – Russia relationship. In 2010, visit to India by Prime Minister Putin and President Medvedev played an important role in strengthening bilateral relationships between India and Russia. India–America Relationship: There was a reluctance in Indian–American relations from the beginning. America was the country which pressurised Britain to free India but after independence, India decided to remain non-aligned and didn’t get involved in any of the blocs. This wasn’t acceptable to America and this resulted in economical and military support to our opposing & neighbouring country, Pakistan. Nehru’s visit to America improved relations in 1957. When America supported Pakistan in Indo–Pak War, the threads of relationships were loosened again. In 1977, the atomic treaty to supply Urenium for Tarapur Nuclear Centre by America in the period of Janta Party was not followed. India refused President Jimmy Carter to sign ‘Nuclear non-proliferation treaty’. America’s continuous act of providing weapons to Pakistan against India prohibited cordial relations during Indira Gandhi tenure as P.M. But India-America relations improved when Rajiv Gandhi’s became the Prime Minister. It continued to be cordial during the period of Bill Clinton’s tenure as President. When World Trade Centre was attacked in 2001, America could realise India’s pain and both the countries could establish ideological unification against terrorism and Indo-American relationship improved. In November 2011, India’s visit by America’s President Obama provided structural strength to India–America long term strategic relationship. Effect of India’s foreign policies on its interests: As a leaders of NAM, India’s response to ongoing Cold War was two-fold – at one level, it took particular case in staying away from two alliances, second, it raised its voice against the newly decolonised countries becoming part of these alliances. India tried to remove the conflicts between both thealliances and tried to establish world peace. However, it also gave its contribution to newly independent countries. A non-aligned posture also served India’s interest very directly, in at least two ways: (i) Non-alignment allowed India to take international decisions and stances that served its interests rather than the interests of superpowers and their allies. (ii) India was often able to balance one superpower against the other. If India felt ignored or unduly pressurised by one superpower, it could tilt towards the other. Neither alliance system could take India for granted or bully it.

When and where did India hold its second nuclear test?,"In Pokhran, in 1998.","1. Country division and Violence: At the time of division of country, it was expected that demands of Mulsim league related to Pakistan would be met and peace would be established between both the countries. But this did not happen. Hindus and Sikhs bearing hair were pushed to India from Pakistan. Property of billions weredestroyed. Crores were displaced. Modesty of mothers and sisters was destroyed. Its reaction was seen in India as well and Muslims left India and settled Pakistan. 2. Attack on Kashmir: Pakistan occupied 2/5 part of the Kashmir by attacking India’s undivided Jammu-Kashmir in 1947. As India believes in the peace policy, the matter was raised in UNO by India. But Pakistan didn’t follow orders of security council. On the other side, India, during the war of 1965 and 1971, released Pakistani regions such as Kashmir, Punjab and Sindh on the basis of Line of Control of 1948 in Jammu and Kashmir. But still, no cooperation could be seen from Pakistan’s side. Pakistan is hostile to India. It takes help of separatists of Jammu-Kashmir and Punjab. Pakistani terrorists have come to Jammu-Kashmir and an undeclared war against India could be sensed. 3. Attack on Kutchh: In January 1965, Pakistan attacked Rann of Kutchh, region of Gujarat, India. War came to an end between both the countries in June 1965 due to international pressures. The matter was given to international judgement for final decision. The problem was thus resolved. 4. Indo-Pakistan War: On September 1965, Pakistan attacked Indian region, Kashmir. Indian army gave a befitted reply to Pakistan. 740 square miles instead of 240 square miles of India was occupied. Pakistan agreed to end the war due to international pressure and internal weeknesses. As per the Tashkent agreement done with the help of Soviet Union, both the countries got ready to station their armies on the boundaries before war could start. In the end of 1971, Pakistan again attacked India but Pakistan had to pay for that. Its eastern alliance Bengal was no longer a part of Pakistan and it emerged as an independent country called ‘Bangladesh’. It was badly defeated by Western alliance and war ceased due to international interference. After the formation of BJP government in March 1998, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee tried to maintain better political relationship with Pakistan. Lahore Bus visit was done by him in February 1999 had this objective. But after some time, Pakistan attacked Kargil area of Jammu-Kashmir in May 1999. Indian army showed bravery, freed each inch of land of India from the enemy. Pakistan had a setback at its political front and was isolated at international front. Pakistan was suspended from the Commonwealth Organisation (Councils of Commonwealth) because of the unconstitutional overthrow of the democratically elected government of Pakistan as a serious violation of the commonwealth’s fundamental political principles (1999). The United States has withheld $50 million remaining in military reimbursements to Pakistan for fiscal year 2016 because it believes that Islamabad has not done enough to blunt the Islamist militant Haqqani network. Indo-Pak relations continue to be stressful from the time of kargil war. All are aware of the fact that Pakistani terrorists are responsible for destructive activities
 in Jammu-Kashmir, India. As a result, relationships have become stressful and mutual discussions between the two countries have stopped. Q.11. Write about Pakistan’s changing relationship with India. [CBSE Delhi 2011] Ans. Indo-Pak changing relationship can be understood by the following points: 1. Pakistan attacked India in 1965 and India too gave a befitting reply. An agreement was signed by both of them in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, with the help of Soviet Union. As a result, Pakistan states, which were won by India, returned back to Pakistan. 2. In 1971, a war between India and Pakistan again took place concerning Bangladesh. Pakistan was badly defeated by India. In addition to this, East Pakistan broke away to emerge as an independent country called ‘Bangladesh’. Prime Ministers of both the countries (India and Pakistan) met at Shimla. A treaty called ‘Shimla Pact’ was signed by them. According to this, both the countries agreed to find solutions to the major problems peacefully. 3. Ministers and officials of India and Pakistan visited each others country in 1985. Agreements to improve agriculture, science and technology and trade were signed. Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi met Pakistani President, General Zia several times. But no solid outcome was observed. Ms. Benezir Bhutto became Prime Minister ofPakistan in 1988. It was expected that relationship between both the countries would become cordial due to democracy, but this didn’t happen. The behaviour opted by Prime Minister of Pakistan, Sh. Nawaz Sharif towards India brought bitterness in Indo-Pak relations. 4. Indo-Pak relations have become better from time to time but promotion to terrorism and separatists in India by Pakistan have made their relations bitter. Hence, no solution has been found out so far. Q.12. Describe common problems of South Asian countries. [CBSE (AI) 2011] Ans. 1. Some member countries of SAARC think that SAFTA is a way for India to ‘Invade’ the markets and to influence their societies and politics through commercial ventures and a commercial presence in their countries. On the other hand, India thinks that there are real economic benefits for all from SAFTA and that a region that trades more freely will be able to cooperate better on political issues. 2. SAARC countries have many internal conflicts. Conflicts over issues such as distribution of river waters and boundaries always continue to remain. India is worried of Pakistan’s initiated terrorism whereas Pakistan has differences with India over on the issue of Kashmir. SAARC has not been able to achieve success properlyas they shake hands but are not unified by their hearts.

The social dominance of the military, clergy and landowning aristocracy has led to the frequent overthrow of elected governments and the establishment of military government in Pakistan. Pakistan’s conflict with India has made the pro-military groups more powerful. Democratic system was adopted in Bangladesh after its independence. Soon afterwards, Sheikh Mujib abolished all the parties except his own, which led to conflicts and tensions. He was assassinated in a military uprising in August 1975 and military rule was established. Democracy was again established there due to public outrage.

Under whose leadership was first democratic government formed in Pakistan post Cold-War?,Benazir Bhutto.,"towards military rule of General Zia-ul-Haq and democratic government under the leadership of Benezir Bhutto, daughter of Bhutto was established in Pakistan. According to the structure of political democratic structure of Pakistan from 1988 to 1999, Benezir Bhutto’s government centered around Pakistan People’s Party and Muslim league of Nawaz Sharif. In starting of 1999, military under leadership of General Parvez Musharraf overthrew government of Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister of Pakistan and was dismissed from Pakistan. General Musharraf got himself elected as the President. Announcement of emergency in Pakistan was done in the last months of 2006. Elections were planned on 8 January 2008 but were postponed due to death of Benezir Bhutto during campaigning. Recently, ordinary elections took place in Pakistan, where Pakistan Muslim League (PML) was formed and Nawaz Sharif was elected as Prime Minister. Q.3. Even after sharing a same history, why roots of democracy could not be strengthened in Pakistan as they are in India? [CBSE (AI) 2011] Ans. The reasons behind unstable democracy in Pakistan are as follows: (i) The social dominance of the military, clergy and landowning aristocracy has led to the frequent overthrow of elected governments and the establishment of military government. Pakistan’s conflict with India has made the pro-military groups more powerful. These groups have often said that political parties and democracy inPakistan are flawed, that Pakistan’s security would be harmed by selfish-minded parties and chaotic democracy, and that army’s stay in power, is therefore, justified. While democracy has not been fully successful in Pakistan, there has been a strong prodemocracy sentiment in the country. (ii) Pakistan has a courageous and relatively free press and a strong human rights movement. The lack of genuine international support for its democratic rule in Pakistan has further encouraged the military to continue its dominance. The United States and other western countries have encouraged the military’s authoritarian rule in the past, for their own reasons. Given the fact that the threat of what they call as ‘Global Islamic Terrorism’ and the apprehension that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal might fall into the hands of these terrorist groups, the military regime in Pakistan has been seen as the protector of Western interests in West Asia and South Asia. Q.4. Explain any three factors that are responsible for the failure of building a stable democratic rule in Pakistan. Ans. The factors responsible for the failure of building a stable democratic rule in Pakistanare as follows: 1. The social dominance of the military, clergy and landowning aristocracy has led to frequent overthrow of elected governments and establishment of military governments.

They thought that Sri Lanka shouldnot give ‘concessions’ to the Tamils because Sri Lanka belongs to the Sinhala people only. The neglect of Tamil concerns led to militant Tamil nationalism. From 1983 onwards, the militant organisation, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has been fighting an armed struggle with the army of Sri Lanka and demanding ‘Tamil Eelam’ or a separate country for the Tamils of Sri Lanka. The LTTE controls the northeastern parts of Sri Lanka.

Who abolished the parliament and dismissed the government in Nepal in 2002?,King Gyanendra.,"fight with LTTE. Shri Premdas became Presidentof Sri Lanka. He was completely against the presence of Indian army in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan citizens saw this as an India’s attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka. Indian Tamils were also unhappy with the proceedings being done against them (Sri Lankan Tamilians) by India. Sri Lankan President Premdasa openly demanded India to take back its armed forces on 29 July, 1989. Uncertainty and strain continued for some time in Sri Lanka. But in December 1989, after the formation of new government, Indian Peace Keeping Force was called back from Sri Lanka on 31 March, 1990. Q.14. What steps have been taken to normalise Indo-Pak relations by Indian rulers in last two decades? Ans. Pakistan’s support to terrorism in Kashmir still continues. Despite of this, Prime Minister Gujral tried to improve bilateral relations. Prime Minister Vajpayee did Lahore Bus Tour and signed Lahore announcement letter in order to promote harmony. In return to this, kargil war was held between both the countries as an undisclosed war. Agra-talks of 2001 failed and terrorist attack on Parliament in December 2001 inspired India to end all diplomatic relations with Pakistan. Pakistan’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) is alleged to be involved in managing in Anti-Indian campaigns. Diplomatic initiatives were again started in 2003 but this was a pain staking way and both the countries were heading for friendly solution carefully. This pause was broken down by Vajpayee’s visit to Islamabad and to start cricket between both countries again. A Re-evaluation of relationship of both the countries was proposed by Manmohan Singh (former Prime Minister of India). Hindrance was seen during Mumbai bomb blast in 2006 but both countries agreed to continue discussion. SAARC summit held at New Delhi 2007 paved way for peace and friendliness in this area between both the countries. They accepted that terrorisom is a challenge in the way of peace and security. When Pakistani Prime Minister visited India in 2014, people of both the countries hoped for a fresh start and improved relations. But Pakistan’s irresponsible attitude towards terrorism cannot be trusted upon. It agrees on eliminating terrorism but does not take any initiative. Instead, it promotes terrorism. Q.15. Mention some of the recent agreements between India and Pakistan. [NCERT] Ans. Although India-Pakistan relations seem revolving around conflicts, there have been a series of efforts to manage tensions and build peace. Following are the recent agreements between them: 1. India-Pakistan held differences over distribution of Indus river waters. Indus River Treaty was signed by India and Pakistan in 1960 by mediation of World Bank. Despite of the differences, the treaty is still in effect. 2. After Indo-Pak war of 1971, Shimla pact was signed by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Indira Gandhi.
 3. Agreements on Salaal-power hydroelectric plan and to increase railways and trade between both countries were done on 14 April, 1978. 4. Agreement on Bus transportation between both the countries was seen after Lahore bus visit of Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1999. 5. Both countries confessed that terrorism is a challenge in the path of peace and security in a Foreign Minister level discussion in July 2012. 6. Detainees of each others’ country are also released from time to time according to various agreements. Q.16. Why was the need of establishment of SAARC felt? Ans. Almost all superpowers tried to influence this region due to which these countries could not become united for mutual cooperation. Countries were seen under the influence of either America or Soviet Union. Tensions were seen among the countries of this region. These superpowers accelerated navy activities and established navy ports in the Indian ocean which led to fear of regional unstability among countries of the region. It was observed that if unity and cooperation among the countries of this region didn’t get establish, then these countries would be exploited by outside powers. It was also felt that mutual cooperation and help can pave the way of their development and can present a powerful region in front of the world. India considers the need of regional cooperation for international peace and order. An organisation of neighbouring countries of India was made in December 1985 for regional cooperation. It is known as ‘The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation’ (SAARC). Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are involved in SAARC. Its head office is in Kathmandu (Nepal). Q.17. How did citizens of Nepal succeed in establishing democracy? Ans. Nepal was a Hindu kingdom in the past and then a constitutional monarchy. Political parties and the common people of Nepal have wanted a more open and responsive system of government. But the king, with the help of the army, retained full control over the government and restricted the expansion of democracy in Nepal. Seigniorial system was there in Nepal till 1950. Rana-family made Nepal king a puppet of their hands. Nepal’s then king Tribhuvan, took shelter in Indian embassy situated at Kathmandu in 1950. In this way, seigniorial system in Nepal came to an end with the help of India and powers came in the hands of king of Nepal, paving way for democracy. From 1950 to 1990, constitutional monarchy was established in the Hindu region of Nepal. The topmost rights were given to the king in the government of Maharaja Tribhuvan, Mahendra, Virendra and Gyanendra. Democratic governments had also been setup several times in those 40 years. Either there was a parliamentary democraticsystem or Panchayat Democracy. But the king was given the topmost rights and powers. During the nineties, the Maoists of Nepal were successful in spreading their influence in many parts of Nepal. They believed in armed insurrection against the
 monarch and the ruling elite. This led to a violent conflict between the Maoist guerrillas and the armed forces of the king. For some time, there was a triangular conflict among the Monarchist forces, the democrats and the Maoists. In 2002, the king abolished the parliament and dismissed the government. King of Nepal, Virendra was assasinated and Gyanendra, brother of Virendra became king of Nepal. He also adopted the policy of suppression of democracy and Maoists. This led to a massive, country wide, prodemocracy protests in April 2002. As a result, the king was forced to restore the House of Representatives that had been dissolved inApril 2002. The largely non-violent movement was led by the Seven Party Alliance (SPA), the Maoists and the social activists. Monarchy has sacrificed all its rights. Nepal is considered as a secural country. A constitutional assembly has been formed for new constitution of Nepal. Nepal is a democratic country now. India has got Nepal as a democratic partner with increase in aspirations. Q.18. Countries of South Asia do not trust each other. This region is unable to exert its influence at international level. Justify this statement and suggest measures to strengthen South Asia. Ans. The statement is totally justified that SAARC is an association of countries of South Asia but is not able to carry out work as an effective organisation due to mutual differences between these countries. They do not trust each other, especially suspicious towards India. Following are the two examples to justify the statement: 1. India-Pakistan are powerful countries of SAARC. Both countries are involved in various conflicts and differences after division and hence, they do not trust each other. Pakistan has held hand of America against India. Two wars have been done between both the countries. The Indian government blamed Pakistan for terrorism and Pakistan government hold India responsible for increasing unstability and unrest. America and China get chance to interfere due to these differences and struggle. 2. There are tensions between India and Sri Lanka. The settlement of Indian Tamils in Sri Lanka is the main reason behind the tensions. India sent the Indian peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka to resolve matter but was pulled out as it was critised by Sri Lankans. The affair/issue has not been resolved yet.Following are the ways to strengthen South Asia: • • • • • •

Which type of government is in Sri Lanka?,Sri Lanka has democratic system of government.,"‘A’ LTTE Awami League Gen. Ayub Khan Monarchy (Not completely democratic)
 fight with LTTE. Shri Premdas became Presidentof Sri Lanka. He was completely against the presence of Indian army in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan citizens saw this as an India’s attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka. Indian Tamils were also unhappy with the proceedings being done against them (Sri Lankan Tamilians) by India. Sri Lankan President Premdasa openly demanded India to take back its armed forces on 29 July, 1989. Uncertainty and strain continued for some time in Sri Lanka. But in December 1989, after the formation of new government, Indian Peace Keeping Force was called back from Sri Lanka on 31 March, 1990. Q.14. What steps have been taken to normalise Indo-Pak relations by Indian rulers in last two decades? Ans. Pakistan’s support to terrorism in Kashmir still continues. Despite of this, Prime Minister Gujral tried to improve bilateral relations. Prime Minister Vajpayee did Lahore Bus Tour and signed Lahore announcement letter in order to promote harmony. In return to this, kargil war was held between both the countries as an undisclosed war. Agra-talks of 2001 failed and terrorist attack on Parliament in December 2001 inspired India to end all diplomatic relations with Pakistan. Pakistan’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) is alleged to be involved in managing in Anti-Indian campaigns. Diplomatic initiatives were again started in 2003 but this was a pain staking way and both the countries were heading for friendly solution carefully. This pause was broken down by Vajpayee’s visit to Islamabad and to start cricket between both countries again. A Re-evaluation of relationship of both the countries was proposed by Manmohan Singh (former Prime Minister of India). Hindrance was seen during Mumbai bomb blast in 2006 but both countries agreed to continue discussion. SAARC summit held at New Delhi 2007 paved way for peace and friendliness in this area between both the countries. They accepted that terrorisom is a challenge in the way of peace and security. When Pakistani Prime Minister visited India in 2014, people of both the countries hoped for a fresh start and improved relations. But Pakistan’s irresponsible attitude towards terrorism cannot be trusted upon. It agrees on eliminating terrorism but does not take any initiative. Instead, it promotes terrorism. Q.15. Mention some of the recent agreements between India and Pakistan. [NCERT] Ans. Although India-Pakistan relations seem revolving around conflicts, there have been a series of efforts to manage tensions and build peace. Following are the recent agreements between them: 1. India-Pakistan held differences over distribution of Indus river waters. Indus River Treaty was signed by India and Pakistan in 1960 by mediation of World Bank. Despite of the differences, the treaty is still in effect. 2. After Indo-Pak war of 1971, Shimla pact was signed by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Indira Gandhi.
 3. Agreements on Salaal-power hydroelectric plan and to increase railways and trade between both countries were done on 14 April, 1978. 4. Agreement on Bus transportation between both the countries was seen after Lahore bus visit of Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1999. 5. Both countries confessed that terrorism is a challenge in the path of peace and security in a Foreign Minister level discussion in July 2012. 6. Detainees of each others’ country are also released from time to time according to various agreements. Q.16. Why was the need of establishment of SAARC felt? Ans. Almost all superpowers tried to influence this region due to which these countries could not become united for mutual cooperation. Countries were seen under the influence of either America or Soviet Union. Tensions were seen among the countries of this region. These superpowers accelerated navy activities and established navy ports in the Indian ocean which led to fear of regional unstability among countries of the region. It was observed that if unity and cooperation among the countries of this region didn’t get establish, then these countries would be exploited by outside powers. It was also felt that mutual cooperation and help can pave the way of their development and can present a powerful region in front of the world. India considers the need of regional cooperation for international peace and order. An organisation of neighbouring countries of India was made in December 1985 for regional cooperation. It is known as ‘The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation’ (SAARC). Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are involved in SAARC. Its head office is in Kathmandu (Nepal). Q.17. How did citizens of Nepal succeed in establishing democracy? Ans. Nepal was a Hindu kingdom in the past and then a constitutional monarchy. Political parties and the common people of Nepal have wanted a more open and responsive system of government. But the king, with the help of the army, retained full control over the government and restricted the expansion of democracy in Nepal. Seigniorial system was there in Nepal till 1950.

Who dominates Sri Lankan Politics?,Majority of Sinhala community dominates politics of Sri Lanka.,"the Awami league led by Shiekh Mujib won all seats in East Pakistan and secured majority in the proposed constituent assembly for the whole of Pakistan. But the government dominated by the West Pakistan refused to convene the assembly. 4. Shiekh Mujib was arrested and under the military rule of General Yahya Khan, the Pakistani army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. This led to a large scale migration into India, creating huge refugee problem for India. 5. The government of India supported the demands of the people of east Pakistan for their Independence and helped them financially and militarily. 6. This resulted in a war between India and Pakistan in December 1971 that ended in the formation of Bangladesh as an independent nation. Q.9. Give a description of India-Sri Lanka relationship by describing ethnic conflicts of Sri Lanka. Ans. Sri Lanka is a small island located at South of India. Like India, Sri Lanka has successfully operated a democratic system since their independence from the British. But lives of the citizens have become bothersome due to ethnic conflicts. Sri Lanka has majority of Sri Lankan natives called ‘Sinhalas’. But a large number of Tamils, who had migrated from India to Sri Lanka are also settled there. They live mainly at Northeastern parts of Sri Lanka. The migration continued even after the independence. Majority of country, i.e., Sinhalas do not like Tamils living in Sri Lanka. They believe that Sri Lanka belongs to Sinhalas only. In 1964, ‘Shastri-Sinimavo Bandaranaike agreement’ was signed to solve the problem concerning Indian Tamils but that couldn’t be implemented properly.After some years, left wing extremists revolted against government in Sri Lanka and government was busy in suppressing them. The neglect and hatred of Tamil by Sinhalas led to fights. Violent fights took place between both communities in 1983. Sri Lankan army suppressed Tamils heartlessly. A serious reaction was seen on Tamilians. The ‘Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam’ (LTTE) was formed and demanded ‘Tamil Eelam’ or a separate country for the Tamils of SriLanka. Firing by aeroplanes in order to destroy Tamil’s military base by Sri Lankan government further worsened the situation. Pressure was put on Tamil Nadu government by Tamils to take measures in the direction of saving their interests and security. The difficulties in the relationship between the governments of India and Sri Lanka are mostly over ethnic conflict in the island nation. Indian leaders and citizens find it impossible to remain neutral when Tamils are politically unhappy and are being killed. After the military intervention in 1987, the Indian government now prefers a policy of disengagement visà-vis Sri Lanka’s internal troubles. India signed a free trade agreement with Sri Lanka, which strengthened relations between two-countries. India’s help in post-tsunami reconstruction in Sri Lanka has also brought the two countries closer. Q.10. Describe important issues or struggles held between India and Pakistan. Ans. Following struggles have taken place between India and Pakistan:
 fight with LTTE. Shri Premdas became Presidentof Sri Lanka. He was completely against the presence of Indian army in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan citizens saw this as an India’s attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka.

Country division and Violence: At the time of division of country, it was expected that demands of Mulsim league related to Pakistan would be met and peace would be established between both the countries. But this did not happen. Hindus and Sikhs bearing hair were pushed to India from Pakistan. Property of billions weredestroyed. Crores were displaced. Modesty of mothers and sisters was destroyed. Its reaction was seen in India as well and Muslims left India and settled Pakistan. 2. Attack on Kashmir: Pakistan occupied 2/5 part of the Kashmir by attacking India’s undivided Jammu-Kashmir in 1947. As India believes in the peace policy, the matter was raised in UNO by India. But Pakistan didn’t follow orders of security council. On the other side, India, during the war of 1965 and 1971, released Pakistani regions such as Kashmir, Punjab and Sindh on the basis of Line of Control of 1948 in Jammu and Kashmir. But still, no cooperation could be seen from Pakistan’s side. Pakistan is hostile to India. It takes help of separatists of Jammu-Kashmir and Punjab. Pakistani terrorists have come to Jammu-Kashmir and an undeclared war against India could be sensed. 3. Attack on Kutchh: In January 1965, Pakistan attacked Rann of Kutchh, region of Gujarat, India. War came to an end between both the countries in June 1965 due to international pressures. The matter was given to international judgement for final decision. The problem was thus resolved. 4. Indo-Pakistan War: On September 1965, Pakistan attacked Indian region, Kashmir. Indian army gave a befitted reply to Pakistan. 740 square miles instead of 240 square miles of India was occupied. Pakistan agreed to end the war due to international pressure and internal weeknesses. As per the Tashkent agreement done with the help of Soviet Union, both the countries got ready to station their armies on the boundaries before war could start. In the end of 1971, Pakistan again attacked India but Pakistan had to pay for that. Its eastern alliance Bengal was no longer a part of Pakistan and it emerged as an independent country called ‘Bangladesh’. It was badly defeated by Western alliance and war ceased due to international interference. After the formation of BJP government in March 1998, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee tried to maintain better political relationship with Pakistan. Lahore Bus visit was done by him in February 1999 had this objective. But after some time, Pakistan attacked Kargil area of Jammu-Kashmir in May 1999. Indian army showed bravery, freed each inch of land of India from the enemy. Pakistan had a setback at its political front and was isolated at international front. Pakistan was suspended from the Commonwealth Organisation (Councils of Commonwealth) because of the unconstitutional overthrow of the democratically elected government of Pakistan as a serious violation of the commonwealth’s fundamental political principles (1999). The United States has withheld $50 million remaining in military reimbursements to Pakistan for fiscal year 2016 because it believes that Islamabad has not done enough to blunt the Islamist militant Haqqani network. Indo-Pak relations continue to be stressful from the time of kargil war. All are aware of the fact that Pakistani terrorists are responsible for destructive activities
 in Jammu-Kashmir, India. As a result, relationships have become stressful and mutual discussions between the two countries have stopped. Q.11. Write about Pakistan’s changing relationship with India. [CBSE Delhi 2011] Ans. Indo-Pak changing relationship can be understood by the following points: 1. Pakistan attacked India in 1965 and India too gave a befitting reply. An agreement was signed by both of them in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, with the help of Soviet Union. As a result, Pakistan states, which were won by India, returned back to Pakistan. 2. In 1971, a war between India and Pakistan again took place concerning Bangladesh.

The behaviour opted by Prime Minister of Pakistan, Sh. Nawaz Sharif towards India brought bitterness in Indo-Pak relations. 4. Indo-Pak relations have become better from time to time but promotion to terrorism and separatists in India by Pakistan have made their relations bitter. Hence, no solution has been found out so far. Q.12. Describe common problems of South Asian countries. [CBSE (AI) 2011] Ans. 1. Some member countries of SAARC think that SAFTA is a way for India to ‘Invade’ the markets and to influence their societies and politics through commercial ventures and a commercial presence in their countries. On the other hand, India thinks that there are real economic benefits for all from SAFTA and that a region that trades more freely will be able to cooperate better on political issues. 2. SAARC countries have many internal conflicts. Conflicts over issues such as distribution of river waters and boundaries always continue to remain. India is worried of Pakistan’s initiated terrorism whereas Pakistan has differences with India over on the issue of Kashmir. SAARC has not been able to achieve success properlyas they shake hands but are not unified by their hearts.

Identify the country that was first to liberalize its economy in the South Asian region. ,Srilanka.,"fight with LTTE. Shri Premdas became Presidentof Sri Lanka. He was completely against the presence of Indian army in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan citizens saw this as an India’s attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka. Indian Tamils were also unhappy with the proceedings being done against them (Sri Lankan Tamilians) by India. Sri Lankan President Premdasa openly demanded India to take back its armed forces on 29 July, 1989. Uncertainty and strain continued for some time in Sri Lanka. But in December 1989, after the formation of new government, Indian Peace Keeping Force was called back from Sri Lanka on 31 March, 1990. Q.14. What steps have been taken to normalise Indo-Pak relations by Indian rulers in last two decades? Ans. Pakistan’s support to terrorism in Kashmir still continues. Despite of this, Prime Minister Gujral tried to improve bilateral relations. Prime Minister Vajpayee did Lahore Bus Tour and signed Lahore announcement letter in order to promote harmony. In return to this, kargil war was held between both the countries as an undisclosed war. Agra-talks of 2001 failed and terrorist attack on Parliament in December 2001 inspired India to end all diplomatic relations with Pakistan. Pakistan’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) is alleged to be involved in managing in Anti-Indian campaigns. Diplomatic initiatives were again started in 2003 but this was a pain staking way and both the countries were heading for friendly solution carefully. This pause was broken down by Vajpayee’s visit to Islamabad and to start cricket between both countries again. A Re-evaluation of relationship of both the countries was proposed by Manmohan Singh (former Prime Minister of India). Hindrance was seen during Mumbai bomb blast in 2006 but both countries agreed to continue discussion. SAARC summit held at New Delhi 2007 paved way for peace and friendliness in this area between both the countries. They accepted that terrorisom is a challenge in the way of peace and security. When Pakistani Prime Minister visited India in 2014, people of both the countries hoped for a fresh start and improved relations. But Pakistan’s irresponsible attitude towards terrorism cannot be trusted upon. It agrees on eliminating terrorism but does not take any initiative. Instead, it promotes terrorism. Q.15. Mention some of the recent agreements between India and Pakistan. [NCERT] Ans. Although India-Pakistan relations seem revolving around conflicts, there have been a series of efforts to manage tensions and build peace. Following are the recent agreements between them: 1. India-Pakistan held differences over distribution of Indus river waters. Indus River Treaty was signed by India and Pakistan in 1960 by mediation of World Bank. Despite of the differences, the treaty is still in effect. 2. After Indo-Pak war of 1971, Shimla pact was signed by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Indira Gandhi.

Where did India and Pakistan conduct nuclear tests? [CBSE (AI) 2012],India conducted nuclear test at Pokhran in 1998 and Pakistan conducted nuclear test at Chagai Hills.,"1. Country division and Violence: At the time of division of country, it was expected that demands of Mulsim league related to Pakistan would be met and peace would be established between both the countries. But this did not happen. Hindus and Sikhs bearing hair were pushed to India from Pakistan. Property of billions weredestroyed. Crores were displaced. Modesty of mothers and sisters was destroyed. Its reaction was seen in India as well and Muslims left India and settled Pakistan. 2. Attack on Kashmir: Pakistan occupied 2/5 part of the Kashmir by attacking India’s undivided Jammu-Kashmir in 1947. As India believes in the peace policy, the matter was raised in UNO by India. But Pakistan didn’t follow orders of security council. On the other side, India, during the war of 1965 and 1971, released Pakistani regions such as Kashmir, Punjab and Sindh on the basis of Line of Control of 1948 in Jammu and Kashmir. But still, no cooperation could be seen from Pakistan’s side. Pakistan is hostile to India. It takes help of separatists of Jammu-Kashmir and Punjab. Pakistani terrorists have come to Jammu-Kashmir and an undeclared war against India could be sensed. 3. Attack on Kutchh: In January 1965, Pakistan attacked Rann of Kutchh, region of Gujarat, India. War came to an end between both the countries in June 1965 due to international pressures. The matter was given to international judgement for final decision. The problem was thus resolved. 4. Indo-Pakistan War: On September 1965, Pakistan attacked Indian region, Kashmir. Indian army gave a befitted reply to Pakistan. 740 square miles instead of 240 square miles of India was occupied. Pakistan agreed to end the war due to international pressure and internal weeknesses. As per the Tashkent agreement done with the help of Soviet Union, both the countries got ready to station their armies on the boundaries before war could start. In the end of 1971, Pakistan again attacked India but Pakistan had to pay for that. Its eastern alliance Bengal was no longer a part of Pakistan and it emerged as an independent country called ‘Bangladesh’. It was badly defeated by Western alliance and war ceased due to international interference. After the formation of BJP government in March 1998, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee tried to maintain better political relationship with Pakistan. Lahore Bus visit was done by him in February 1999 had this objective. But after some time, Pakistan attacked Kargil area of Jammu-Kashmir in May 1999. Indian army showed bravery, freed each inch of land of India from the enemy. Pakistan had a setback at its political front and was isolated at international front. Pakistan was suspended from the Commonwealth Organisation (Councils of Commonwealth) because of the unconstitutional overthrow of the democratically elected government of Pakistan as a serious violation of the commonwealth’s fundamental political principles (1999). The United States has withheld $50 million remaining in military reimbursements to Pakistan for fiscal year 2016 because it believes that Islamabad has not done enough to blunt the Islamist militant Haqqani network. Indo-Pak relations continue to be stressful from the time of kargil war. All are aware of the fact that Pakistani terrorists are responsible for destructive activities
 in Jammu-Kashmir, India. As a result, relationships have become stressful and mutual discussions between the two countries have stopped. Q.11. Write about Pakistan’s changing relationship with India. [CBSE Delhi 2011] Ans. Indo-Pak changing relationship can be understood by the following points: 1. Pakistan attacked India in 1965 and India too gave a befitting reply. An agreement was signed by both of them in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, with the help of Soviet Union. As a result, Pakistan states, which were won by India, returned back to Pakistan. 2. In 1971, a war between India and Pakistan again took place concerning Bangladesh.

Q.12. Describe common problems of South Asian countries. [CBSE (AI) 2011] Ans. 1. Some member countries of SAARC think that SAFTA is a way for India to ‘Invade’ the markets and to influence their societies and politics through commercial ventures and a commercial presence in their countries. On the other hand, India thinks that there are real economic benefits for all from SAFTA and that a region that trades more freely will be able to cooperate better on political issues. 2. SAARC countries have many internal conflicts. Conflicts over issues such as distribution of river waters and boundaries always continue to remain.

SAARC has not been able to achieve success properlyas they shake hands but are not unified by their hearts.
 agreement was signed between both the countries for military, technology and trade. Russia supported India during Indo-Pak War. On 7 December 1999, a ten-year agreement between India and Russia was signed. According to this, Indo-Russia would collectively produce military and non-military aircrafts. Indian nuclear tests were supported by Russia in 1998. By keeping in mind all the above factors, we reach on a conclusion that India should not be much dependent on America after having Russia, as a trusted friend. The following are the reasons for the above conclusion: 1. America forced Britain to free India but it opposed India when India adopted nonalignment policy after independence. Instead, it supported Pakistan, India’s rival country and started providing military assistance to Pakistan. 2. America doesn’t want India to emerge as a powerful nation. It opposed India’s nuclear tests and forced India to sign Nuclear Treaty CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty). India always stood against America’s dual policy. 3. America also adopts a dual policy on the issue of terrorism. It says India to remain patient on the issue of Pakistan’s terror attacks. On the contrary, it attacked Afghanistan, causing huge devastation when it was under terror attack. 4. Indo-America’s relationship can’t be as cordial as Pak-America relationship. Pakistan has always been a country of America’s alliance and also gained military assistance from America. Q.20. There had always been an apprehension and risk of struggle and tension in most of the former Soviet Republics. Explain with any 3 examples. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Or Explain the struggle and tension in former Soviet Republics. Ans. Bipolarity has collapsed. Second World War didn’t end the struggle and tension in former Soviet Republics. Most of the former Soviet Republics are prone to conflict and many had civil wars and insurgencies. Growing involvement of outside power had complicated the picture. Some examples are as follows:

What are the main issues of India-Bangladesh conflicts? ,River water conflicts Problem of refugees,"Q.1. Explain any three environmental concerns in global politics. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. Environmental concerns in global politics: (i) Cultivated area in world is limited and there is less scope to expand it. It is also a matter of concern that a substantial portion of existing agricultural land is losing fertility and are over-harvested. (ii) Issues related to access safe water and sanitation is very important. According to UNDP report, 1.2 billion people in developing countries have no access to safe water and 2.6 billion have no access to sanitation. (iii) For ecological balance, natural forests are important environmental concerns in global politics. Ecological degradation may affect climate change and it may affect biodiversity on land. (iv) A steady decline in the total amount of ozone in the earth’s stratosphere poses a real danger to ecosystems and human health. (v) The Coastal waters are becoming increasingly polluted largly due to landbased activities. It may cause deterioration in the quality of marine environment. Q.2. What is meant by ‘Common but differentiated responsibility’? How could we implement the idea? [NCERT] Or ‘States have Common but different responsibilities towards environment’. Substantiate your answer with a suitable example. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Or Explain ‘Common but different responsibilities’. How and where has this been pressurised? [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. On the issue of ‘Environmental Protection’, the developing countries agree that ecological degradation is a product of industrial development undertaken by advanced countries. Thus responsibilities of its compensation should be a priority. This argument
 was accepted in the Rio Declaration at the ‘Earth Summit’ in 1992 and is called the principle of ‘Common but differentiated responsibilities’. The relevant part of the Rio Declaration says that ‘States shall cooperate in the spirit of global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity of Earth’s ecosystem, in view of the different contributions of global environmental deterioration, states have common but differentiated responsibilities. The developedcountries acknowledge the responsibilities that they bear in the international pursuit of sustainable development in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technological and financial resources they command’. The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also provides that the parties should act to protect the climate system on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Q.3. Explain indigenous people and their rights with respect to India. Ans. The indigenous people bring the issues of environment, resources and politics together. The UN defines indigenous populations as comprising the descendants of peoples who inhabited the present territory of a state at the time when persons of a different culture or ethnic origin arrived there from other parts of the world and overpowered them. Indigenous people today live more in conformity with their particular social, economic, and cultural customs and traditions than the institutions of the country of which they now form a part. In the context of the world politics, the common interest of approximately 30 crore indigenous people spread throughout the world including India, like other social movements, indigenous people speak of their struggles, their agenda and their rights. The indigenous voices in the world politics call for the admission of indigenous people to the world community as equals, indigenous people occupy areas in Central and South America, Africa, India and Southeast Asia. In India, the description ‘Indigenous People’ is usually applied to the scheduled tribes, who constitute nearly 8 per cent of the population of the country. With the exception of small communities of hunters and gatherers, most indigenous population in India depend for their subsistence primarily on the cultivation of land. For Centuries, if notmillennia, they had free access to as much land as they could cultivate. It was only after the establishment of the British colonial rule that areas, which had previously been inhabited by the Scheduled Tribe Communities were subjected to outside forces. Although they enjoy a constitutional protection in political representation, they havenot got much of the benefits of development in the country. In fact, they have paid a huge cost for development since they are the single largest group among the people displaced by various development projects since independence.Issues related to the rights of the indigenous communities have been neglected in domestic and international politics for very long. During the 1970s, growing indigenous leaders from around the world aroused the world a sense of common concern and shared experience. The World Council of Indigenous peoples was formed in 1975. The council became subsequently the first of 11 indigenous NGOs to receive consultative status in the UN.

What is the full form of SAARC?,South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.,"1. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is a major regional initiative by the South Asian states to evolve cooperation through multilateral means. 2. A new chapter of peace and cooperation might evolve in South Asia if all the countries in the region allow free trade across the borders. Q.6. ‘Despite the mixed record of the democratic experience, the people in all these countries share the aspiration for democracy.’ Explain. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are included in South Asia. They stand for diversity in every sense. The various countries in South Asia do not have the same kind of political systems. Sri Lanka and India have democratic system. Pakistan and Bangladesh have experienced both civilian and military rulers. Nepal has a constitutional monarchy but democracy has established there as well. Maldives has also achieved democracy. The social dominance of the military, clergy and landowning aristocracy has led to the frequent overthrow of elected governments and the establishment of military government in Pakistan. Pakistan’s conflict with India has made the pro-military groups more powerful. Democratic system was adopted in Bangladesh after its independence. Soon afterwards, Sheikh Mujib abolished all the parties except his own, which led to conflicts and tensions. He was assassinated in a military uprising in August 1975 and military rule was established. Democracy was again established there due to public outrage. Nepal had a constitutional monarchy but due to public revolt, democraticconstitution was given acceptance in 1990. In 2002, king Gyanendra abolished the parliament and dismissed the government. Process of establishing democracy had started after elections held in 2007. Presently, democracy has been established there. Democracy is playing an active role in Bhutan and Maldives as well. Q.7. Write any two reasons of public outrage of eastern Pakistan (Present Bangladesh) against Western Pakistan. [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. 1. The people of this region resented the domination of Western Pakistan and the imposition of the Urdu language. Soon after the partition, they began protests against the unfair treatment meted out to the Bengali culture and language. They also demanded fair representation in administration and a fair share in political power. 2. National Assembly elections were held in 1970. The Awami League led by Sheikh Mujib ur Rehman won all the seats in East Pakistan and secured a majority in the proposed constituent assembly for the whole of Pakistan. But the government dominated by the West Pakistani leadership refused to convene the assembly. Sheikh Mujib ur Rehman was arrested. Public of eastern Bengal outraged and demanded for independence.

To attain social and cultural development in South Asia and to offer respectable positions of the workers of this region in order to improve their skills. To support and promote self-confidence among countries of South Asia collectively. To look at each other’s problems with mutual trust, understanding and appreciation. To promote cooperation with other developing countries. To cooperate with international and regional institutes to accomplish the objectives of SAARC.
 Q.15. What is meant by SAARC? How can peace and cooperation be promoted by this? [CBSE Delhi 2010] Ans. SAARC is an association of 8 countries of South Asia. It stands for the South Asian Association for Regional cooperation. It was established in 1985. It is an initiative by the South Asian states to evolve cooperation through multilateral means. 18 summits have been held of SAARC so far. Its headquarters is situated at Kathmandu, Capital of Nepal. Members of SAARC have evolved new chapter of peace and cooperation by signing South Asian Free Trade Agreement. It aims at lowering trade tariffs by 20 per cent so that all SAARC members agree on free trade agreement, thus establishing peace and cooperation. Q.16. What is the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA)? Ans. The seven members of SAARC signed the South Asian Free Trade Agreement in 2004. This agreement has come into effect from 1 January, 2006. It has promised the formation of a free trade zone in the whole for South Asia. A new chapter of peace and cooperation might evolve in South Asia if all the countries in the region allow free tradeacross all borders. SAFTA aims at lowering trade tariffs by 20 per cent by 2007. But some of our neighbours fear that SAFTA is a way for India to ‘invade’ their markets on the basis of its developed economical and commercial position. Its aim is to be

These groups have often said that political parties and democracy in Pakistan are flawed; that Pakistan’s security would be harmed by selfish minded parties and chaotic democracy and that army’s stay in power is, therefore, justified. 3. The lack of genuine international support for democratic rule in Pakistan has further encouraged military to continue its dominance. Q.5. Describe India-Nepal relationship. Ans. India has special friendly relationship with world’s only Hindu country, Nepal. Citizens of Nepal enjoy special benefits in trade and commerce in India. Large number of natives of Nepal have shown bravery in Indian army. India has assisted Nepal in its many plans and projects. India has played a major role in getting Nepal independence from autocracy of Rana dynasty. An agreement of peace, friendship and trade was signed by both the countries on 31 July, 1950. Special facilities have been given to India by Nepal. Some disputes occurred when India supported democratic movement against Mahendra, King of Nepal. Nepal’s trust was re-established when Indira Gandhi, Prime Minister of India visited Nepal. Nepal provided port facility to Kolkata after signing TTT, which accelerated normalisation of Indo-Nepal relationship. The tensions of 1989 were resolved due to re-establishment of multilateral system. TTT was revised by both the countries in 1991 and 2002. United River Development Project agreement was signed in 1996 by both the countries and agreed on cooperation with the help of SAARC. Reestablishment of democracy in Nepal strengthen Indo-Nepal relationship. Both are engaged in identifying regions of cooperation and collective benefits. Stability to IndoNepal relationship and emergence of Free Trade Area in South Asia will be accelerated because of the Maoists and seven teams agreement in 2007. Indian Prime Minister visited Nepal in 2015 and proposed to resolve matters peacefully. He promised to assist Nepal to resolve destruction occurred due to earthquake in Nepal. At present, IndoNepal relations are peaceful and India tries its level best to help Nepal. Q.6. Give a brief description of relationship of India and the Maldives. Ans. India’s ties with the Maldives remain warm and cordial. Islamic region, the Maldives is deeply associated with India. Port of Indian navy, soldiers was established at GAN which remained till 1975 during British rule in addition to India’s responsibility of security of Maldives. The Maldives participated in establishing SAARC in the summit of foreign ministers of seven states of South Asia – Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, The Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka organised at New Delhi, Capital of India in 1983. In November 1988, some handful of terrorists tried to overthrow Abdul Gayum government with foreign help. On the request of President of the Maldives, India sent its army and completely defeated conspirators. Indian army stayed at the Maldives for a year until the government of the Maldives got stable and returned India on 3 November, 1989. The Maldives successfully organised the 5th SAARC summit in its capital, Male’ in 1990. India is Supporting the Maldives in its plans. It has given Indira Gandhi
 Memorial Hospital to it as a gift. Peaceful, affectionate, free from problems and high levelled relationship can be seen between both the countries. Citizens of the Maldives are getting trained in Indian Institutes of Technology. The Joint Commission was formalised between both the countries in 1990, which illustrates the progress & development of bilateral programmes and decides future plans. Q.7. Explain ups and downs in Indo-Bangladesh relationship. Or Assess the positive and negative aspects of India’s relations with Bangladesh. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. India played a major role in the formation of Bangladesh. It was due to India’s efforts and immediate help from Soviet Union that Bangladesh gained membership of UNO. The governments of India and Bangladesh have had differences over several issues including the sharing of the Ganga and Brahmaputra river waters. The Indian government has been unhappy with Bangladesh’s denial of illegal immigration to India, its support for anti-Indian Islamic fundamentalist groups, Bangladesh’s refusal to allow Indian troops to move through its territory to northeastern India, and its decision not to export natural gas to India or allow Myanmar to do so through Bangladeshi territory. Bangladeshi governments have felt that the Indian government behaves like a regional bully over the sharing of river waters, encouraging rebellion in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, trying to extract its natural gas and being unfair in trade. The two countries have not succeeded in resolving their boundary dispute. Despite their differences, India and Bangladesh do cooperate on many issues. Economic relations have improved considerably in the last ten years. Bangladesh is a part of India’s Look East Policy that wants to link up with Southeast Asia via Myanmar. On disaster management and environmental issues, the two states have cooperated regularly. Efforts are on to broaden the areas of cooperation further by identifying common threats and being more sensitive to other’s needs. Q.8. Describe the series of events that led to the formation of Bangladesh. [CBSE Sample Paper 2016] Ans. The series of events that led to the formation of Bangladesh are: 1. The people of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) resented the domination of western Pakistan and imposition of Urdu language. 2. Soon after the partition, they began protests against the unfair treatment meted out to the Bengali culture and language. They also demanded fair representation in administration and a fair share in political power. 3. Sheikh Mujibur Rehman led the popular struggle against West Pakistani domination. He demanded autonomy for the eastern region. In 1970 elections in the then Pakistan,
 the Awami league led by Shiekh Mujib won all seats in East Pakistan and secured majority in the proposed constituent assembly for the whole of Pakistan. But the government dominated by the West Pakistan refused to convene the assembly. 4. Shiekh Mujib was arrested and under the military rule of General Yahya Khan, the Pakistani army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. This led to a large scale migration into India, creating huge refugee problem for India. 5. The government of India supported the demands of the people of east Pakistan for their Independence and helped them financially and militarily. 6. This resulted in a war between India and Pakistan in December 1971 that ended in the formation of Bangladesh as an independent nation. Q.9. Give a description of India-Sri Lanka relationship by describing ethnic conflicts of Sri Lanka. Ans. Sri Lanka is a small island located at South of India. Like India, Sri Lanka has successfully operated a democratic system since their independence from the British. But lives of the citizens have become bothersome due to ethnic conflicts. Sri Lanka has majority of Sri Lankan natives called ‘Sinhalas’. But a large number of Tamils, who had migrated from India to Sri Lanka are also settled there. They live mainly at Northeastern parts of Sri Lanka. The migration continued even after the independence. Majority of country, i.e., Sinhalas do not like Tamils living in Sri Lanka. They believe that Sri Lanka belongs to Sinhalas only. In 1964, ‘Shastri-Sinimavo Bandaranaike agreement’ was signed to solve the problem concerning Indian Tamils but that couldn’t be implemented properly.After some years, left wing extremists revolted against government in Sri Lanka and government was busy in suppressing them. The neglect and hatred of Tamil by Sinhalas led to fights. Violent fights took place between both communities in 1983. Sri Lankan army suppressed Tamils heartlessly. A serious reaction was seen on Tamilians. The ‘Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam’ (LTTE) was formed and demanded ‘Tamil Eelam’ or a separate country for the Tamils of SriLanka. Firing by aeroplanes in order to destroy Tamil’s military base by Sri Lankan government further worsened the situation. Pressure was put on Tamil Nadu government by Tamils to take measures in the direction of saving their interests and security. The difficulties in the relationship between the governments of India and Sri Lanka are mostly over ethnic conflict in the island nation. Indian leaders and citizens find it impossible to remain neutral when Tamils are politically unhappy and are being killed. After the military intervention in 1987, the Indian government now prefers a policy of disengagement visà-vis Sri Lanka’s internal troubles. India signed a free trade agreement with Sri Lanka, which strengthened relations between two-countries. India’s help in post-tsunami reconstruction in Sri Lanka has also brought the two countries closer. Q.10. Describe important issues or struggles held between India and Pakistan. Ans. Following struggles have taken place between India and Pakistan:
 Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka.

What is meant by Hegemony? ,"Hegemony means becoming powerful or doing something for power. It is the form of military domination, economic power, political clout and cultural superiority.","Q.1. What do you mean by hegemony? Ans. Politics is about power. This power is in the form of military domination, economic power, political supremacy and cultural superiority. Just as individuals want to gain and retain power, groups too want to gain and retain power. In the case of world politics too, countries and groups of countries are engaged in constantly trying to gain and retain power. In international politics too, the standards of countries or states are decided and the most powerful country at one particular time also comes into picture. The hegemony tells position of a country in the international community. This power is in the form of military dominations, economic power, politics clout and cultural superiority. It may be appropriate to describe an International system with only one centre of power by the term ‘hegemony’. Q.2. When did Cold War end and what was its effect on both the superpowers? Ans. The Cold War which began after the end of the Second World War ended in 1991 with the disintegration of Soviet Union. It had to face public outrage due to the policies of Soviet Union. It couldn’t stand for a long time and was thus disintegrated. As a result, Soviet Union’s even the trace of Soviet Union was erased from world’s map. The end of one superpower marked the end of the Cold war as well and concept of ‘Unipolar’ system came into existence. US became the sole superpower of the world and thus were successful in establishing its hegemony in the world. Q.3. What was the chief reason for the beginning of US hegemony? [CBSE (AI) 2013] Ans. Expansion of American ideology of capitalism after the end of Cold War or disintegration of Soviet Union was the principal reason behind the US hegemony. Q.4. What was ‘Operation Desert Storm’? Ans. In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, rapidly occupying and subsequently annexing it. After a series of diplomatic attempt failed at convincing Iraq to quit its aggression the United Nation mandated the liberation of Kuwait by force. A massive coalition force of 6,60,000 troops from 34 countries fought against Iraq and defeated in it what came to be known as the ‘Operation Desert Storm’. It is also known as ‘First Gulf War’. It was mainly an American strategy. An American general, Norman Schwarzkopf, led the UN coalition was also there. Q.5. What is operation ‘Infinite Reach’ as per the President Clinton? [CBSE Delhi 2012]
 Q.7. What do you mean by US hegemony in today’s world? Which two constraints control US hegemony? [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. US hegemony in today’s world politics means dominance of US at global stage. After the Collapse of bipolar world, US has emerged as a sole superpower and unipolar system is established in the world. US hegemony can be seen as hard power, structural power and soft power. It can interfere in any part of the world in its economy and military affairs. There are two constraints on American power: 1. The system of division of American powers among three parts. 2. NATO-NATO is the only organization in International system that could possibly moderate the exercise of American Power today. Q.8. What are the constraints on American hegemony today? Which of these do you expect to get more importance in the future? [NCERT] Or Mention any two constraints that come in the wars of American hegemony. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. History tells us that empires decline because they decay from within. Similarly the biggest constraints to American hegemony lie within the heart of hegemony itself. Although, none of these constraints seemed to operate in the years following 9/11, but it now appears that all three of these constraints are slowly beginning to operate again. These are as follows: (i) Institutional Architecture of America: The first constraint is the institutional architecture of America itself. A system of division of powers between the three branches of the government, places significant breaks upon the unrestrained and immoderate exercise of America’s military power of the executive branch. This isthe best example of constraints on American hegemony today. (ii) Domestic Nature of American Power: The second constraint on American hegemony is internal and domestic nature of American power. Although the American mass media may from time to time impose or promote a particular perspective on domestic public opinion in the US, there is nevertheless a deep skepticism regarding the purposes and methods of government in American political culture. This factor is a huge constraint on US military action overseas. (iii) North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO): NATO is the third most important factor that imposes a constraint on American power in global politics. Clearly, the US
 has an enormous interest in keeping the alliance of democracies that follow the market economies alive and therefore it is possible that its allies in the NATO will be able to moderate the exercise of US hegemony. Q.9. Describe US hegemony as a soft power. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Or ‘US’s hegemony as a soft power cannot be denied.’ Comment. Ans. After the Second World War, America’s cultural superiority along with military and soft power dominance can also be seen. Here, hegemony implies class ascendancy in the social, political and particularly ideological spheres. Hegemony arises when the dominant country can win the consent of dominated classes, by persuading the dominated classes to view the world in a manner favourable to the ascendancy of the dominant class. A dominant power deploys notonly military power but also ideological resources to shape the behavior of competing and lesser powers. Consent, in other words, goes hand-in-hand with, and often more effective than, coercion. The predominance of the US in the world today is based not only on its military power and economic powers, but also on its cultural presence. India’s example can justify this. It is the dream of every literate Indian that he/she wants to go settle in US by any means because they feel their future is secured in US. India is adopting culture, living sense of US. US has been benefitted by this reaction is expanding its dominance. Even during the Cold War, the society of Soviet Union was very much impressed by the improvised of US. The youth of Soviet Union was most impressed by wearing the popular blue jeans. As a result, they used to feel satisfied after purchasing blue jeans from market ever if they spend their yearly income. These blue jeans were not available in their own country. During the Cold War, the US found it difficult to score victories against the Soviet Union in the realm of hard power. It was in the area of structural power and soft power that the US scored notable victories. The interest of citizens of Soviet Union in blue jeans clearly shows this. The US culture is very attractive and is most powerful. It is that aspect of soft power where the country wins the consent of dominated classes.

"Under which strategy, did the USA give help to Europe for its redevelopment, after the Second World War? ",USA gave economic help for the development of Europe under ‘Marshall Plan’ (1947-52).,"for reviving Europe’s economy under what was called the ‘Marshall Plan’ in 1948. Western countries were made clear that they would definitely have to face a huge destruction if they continue to fight amongst themselves. The incident of monopoly of a communist government in Czechoslovakia in February 1948 made this clear. The Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) was established in 1948 to channel aid to the West European states. ‘The Council of Europe’ established in 1949, was another step forward in political cooperation. The process of economic integration of European capitalist countries proceeded step by step leading to the formation of the European Economic Community in 1957. The Collapse of the Soviet bloc put Europe on a fast track and resulted inthe establishment of the European Union in 1992. The foundation was thus laid for a common foreign and security policy, cooperation on justice and home affairs and the creation of a single currency. It has its own flag, anthem, founding date, and currency. It also has some form of a common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations. Q.3. Name the pillars and objectives of the ASEAN Community. [NCERT] Ans. Countries of South-East Asia were under pressure of colonialism before the Second World War. The colonialism was of European countries like France, Britain and Holland. These countries, even after their independence had to suffer from miseries like poverty, illiteracy, scarcity of food, economic backwardness and formation of nation. They had to suffer from the hegemony of a single superpower after the end of Cold War. Bandung summit and NAM didn’t prove successful in promoting unity in Asia and third world countries. In this condition, five countries of South-East Asia namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand by signing the Bangkok Declaration in 1967, established Association for Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN took step forward to form ASEAN community based on the following three pillars in 2003: 1. ASEAN security community: ASEAN security community was based on the conviction that outstanding territorial disputes should not escalate into armed confrontation. By 2003, ASEAN has several agreements in place by which member state promised to uphold peace, neutrality, cooperation, noninterference, and respect for national differences and sovereign rights. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), established in 1994, is an organisation that carries out coordination of security and foreign policy. 2. ASEAN Economic Community: ASEAN still remains principally an economic association. While the ASEAN region as a whole is a much smaller economy compared to the US, the EU and Japan, its economy is growing much faster than all these. This accounts for the growth in its influence on both, in the region and beyond. The objectives of the ASEAN Economic Community are to create a common market and production base with ASEAN states and to aid social and

Which two constraints control US hegemony? [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. US hegemony in today’s world politics means dominance of US at global stage. After the Collapse of bipolar world, US has emerged as a sole superpower and unipolar system is established in the world. US hegemony can be seen as hard power, structural power and soft power. It can interfere in any part of the world in its economy and military affairs. There are two constraints on American power: 1. The system of division of American powers among three parts. 2. NATO-NATO is the only organization in International system that could possibly moderate the exercise of American Power today. Q.8. What are the constraints on American hegemony today? Which of these do you expect to get more importance in the future? [NCERT] Or Mention any two constraints that come in the wars of American hegemony. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. History tells us that empires decline because they decay from within. Similarly the biggest constraints to American hegemony lie within the heart of hegemony itself. Although, none of these constraints seemed to operate in the years following 9/11, but it now appears that all three of these constraints are slowly beginning to operate again. These are as follows: (i) Institutional Architecture of America: The first constraint is the institutional architecture of America itself. A system of division of powers between the three branches of the government, places significant breaks upon the unrestrained and immoderate exercise of America’s military power of the executive branch. This isthe best example of constraints on American hegemony today. (ii) Domestic Nature of American Power: The second constraint on American hegemony is internal and domestic nature of American power. Although the American mass media may from time to time impose or promote a particular perspective on domestic public opinion in the US, there is nevertheless a deep skepticism regarding the purposes and methods of government in American political culture. This factor is a huge constraint on US military action overseas. (iii) North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO): NATO is the third most important factor that imposes a constraint on American power in global politics. Clearly, the US

Name a strategy to escape from US hegemony.,One of the strategies to escape from US hegemony is to ‘hide’. ,"The best way to resist hegemony is to work with rather than against the hegemony. So, instead of engaging in activities opposed to hegemonic power, it may be to extract benefits by operating within the hegemonic system. Hide – Another strategy implies staying away from the dominant power as fas as possible. All the big powers like China, Russia, the European Union are seeking to stay below the radar but this cannot go on for a long time. However, some people believe that resistance to the US hegemony is the only solution but not from states who are unable to face the hegemony.
 Q.1. What do you mean by hegemony? Ans. Politics is about power. This power is in the form of military domination, economic power, political supremacy and cultural superiority. Just as individuals want to gain and retain power, groups too want to gain and retain power. In the case of world politics too, countries and groups of countries are engaged in constantly trying to gain and retain power. In international politics too, the standards of countries or states are decided and the most powerful country at one particular time also comes into picture. The hegemony tells position of a country in the international community. This power is in the form of military dominations, economic power, politics clout and cultural superiority. It may be appropriate to describe an International system with only one centre of power by the term ‘hegemony’. Q.2. When did Cold War end and what was its effect on both the superpowers? Ans. The Cold War which began after the end of the Second World War ended in 1991 with the disintegration of Soviet Union. It had to face public outrage due to the policies of Soviet Union. It couldn’t stand for a long time and was thus disintegrated. As a result, Soviet Union’s even the trace of Soviet Union was erased from world’s map. The end of one superpower marked the end of the Cold war as well and concept of ‘Unipolar’ system came into existence. US became the sole superpower of the world and thus were successful in establishing its hegemony in the world. Q.3. What was the chief reason for the beginning of US hegemony? [CBSE (AI) 2013] Ans. Expansion of American ideology of capitalism after the end of Cold War or disintegration of Soviet Union was the principal reason behind the US hegemony. Q.4. What was ‘Operation Desert Storm’? Ans. In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, rapidly occupying and subsequently annexing it. After a series of diplomatic attempt failed at convincing Iraq to quit its aggression the United Nation mandated the liberation of Kuwait by force. A massive coalition force of 6,60,000 troops from 34 countries fought against Iraq and defeated in it what came to be known as the ‘Operation Desert Storm’. It is also known as ‘First Gulf War’. It was mainly an American strategy. An American general, Norman Schwarzkopf, led the UN coalition was also there. Q.5. What is operation ‘Infinite Reach’ as per the President Clinton? [CBSE Delhi 2012]
 Ans. President Clinton ordered ‘Operation Infinite Reach’, a series of cruise missile strikes on Al-Qaeda terrorists’ targets in Sudan and Afghanistan. Q.6. What reforms were brought out by Bill Clinton in his policies? Ans. George H.W. Bush the elections of First Gulf War lost the presidency elections held in 1992 by Bill Clinton, leader of democratic party. Bill Clinton won in 1996 also and ruled for eight years. He campaigned on domestic rather than foreign policy issues. It often seemed that the US had withdrawn into the internal affairs and was not withdrawn into the internal affairs and was not engaged in world politics. In foreign policy, the Clinton government tended to focus on ‘Soft issues’ like democracy promotion, climate change and world trade rather than on the ‘hard politics of military power and security. Q.7. What was ‘Operation Enduring Freedom’ launched by US? [CBSE (AI) 2012] Ans. After 9/11, the US launched operation ‘Enduring Freedom’ against all those suspected behind this attack, mainly Al-Qaeda and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Its objective was to break communication and to eliminate all those who were supporting terrorism by being friendly with terrorism by being friendly with terrorists’ groups. Q.8. Give classic example of America as a structural power. Ans. A classic example of the structural power, of the US in the academic degree called the Masters in Business Administration (MBA). The idea that business is a profession that depends upon skills that can be taught in a university is uniquely American. The first business school in the world, the ‘Wharton School’ at the University of Pennsylvania, was established in 1881. The first MBA Course was initiated around 1900. The first MBA Course outside the US was established only in 1950. Today, there is no country in the world in which the MBA is not a prestigious academic degree. Q.9. What is 9/11? What is its significance? Ans. 9/11 came to be known as the most unfortunate and ‘Black day’ in the history of US. On 11 September 2001, nineteen hijackers hailing from a number of Arab countries took control of four American Commercial aircrafts shortly after their take off and flew them into important buildings in the US. One airline each crashed into North and South Towers of the World Trade Centre in New York. A third aircraft crashed into the Pentagon building in Arlington, where the US Defence Department is headquartered. The fourth aircraft, presumably bound for the capital building of the US Congress. The attacks have come to be known as ‘9/11’. Q.10. What do you mean by Bandwagon strategy? [CBSE (Comptt.) 2014]
 Ans. Instead of engaging in activities opposed to the hegemonic power, it may be advisable to extract benefits by operating within the hegemonic system. This is called the ‘bandwagon’ strategy. In other words benefitting itself by being under the hegemony of America instead of fighting against it. Q.11. What do you mean by ‘Operation Enduring Freedom’? [CBSE Delhi 2013, (AI) 2014] Ans. Al-Qaeda and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan were held responsible for 9/11 attack in US. The US launched ‘Operation Enduring Freedom’ against terrorism. American President George Bush announced the objective of ‘Global War on Terror’ as a means to eliminate terrorists’ groups spread in the world. Q.12. Write the objectives of Iraq invasion by US. Ans. Iraq had surplus oilfields. US wanted to gain a control over Iraq’s oilfields. Although, US has 40 percent oil resources, but it still wanted to maintain its hegemony on oil resources of Iraq and other oil-producing countries. US wanted to increase its hegemony in the world and wanted to install a regime friendly to the US so that it could establish a friendly relations with Kuwait and other Gulf and Oil-producing countries.

(iii) North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO): NATO is the third most important factor that imposes a constraint on American power in global politics. Clearly, the US
 has an enormous interest in keeping the alliance of democracies that follow the market economies alive and therefore it is possible that its allies in the NATO will be able to moderate the exercise of US hegemony. Q.9. Describe US hegemony as a soft power. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Or ‘US’s hegemony as a soft power cannot be denied.’ Comment. Ans. After the Second World War, America’s cultural superiority along with military and soft power dominance can also be seen. Here, hegemony implies class ascendancy in the social, political and particularly ideological spheres. Hegemony arises when the dominant country can win the consent of dominated classes, by persuading the dominated classes to view the world in a manner favourable to the ascendancy of the dominant class. A dominant power deploys notonly military power but also ideological resources to shape the behavior of competing and lesser powers. Consent, in other words, goes hand-in-hand with, and often more effective than, coercion. The predominance of the US in the world today is based not only on its military power and economic powers, but also on its cultural presence. India’s example can justify this. It is the dream of every literate Indian that he/she wants to go settle in US by any means because they feel their future is secured in US. India is adopting culture, living sense of US. US has been benefitted by this reaction is expanding its dominance. Even during the Cold War, the society of Soviet Union was very much impressed by the improvised of US. The youth of Soviet Union was most impressed by wearing the popular blue jeans. As a result, they used to feel satisfied after purchasing blue jeans from market ever if they spend their yearly income. These blue jeans were not available in their own country. During the Cold War, the US found it difficult to score victories against the Soviet Union in the realm of hard power. It was in the area of structural power and soft power that the US scored notable victories. The interest of citizens of Soviet Union in blue jeans clearly shows this. The US culture is very attractive and is most powerful. It is that aspect of soft power where the country wins the consent of dominated classes.
 "
What are the three different aspects of US hegemony?,"(i) Hard power, (ii) Structural power, (iii) Soft power.","The most important factor for the overwhelming superiority of US power is its superiority of its military power. American military dominance is both absolute and relative. In absolute terms, the US has military capabilities that can reach any point on the planet accurately, lethally and in real time. While its own forces are sheltered to the maximum extent possible from the dangers of war. No other power can remotely match US military might. It spends more on its military capability than the next 12 powers combined. The military dominance of the US is not just based on higher military spending, but on the qualitative gap, that no other power can match. (Any two points)

The power of the US and its veto power the US can stop any moves that it finds annoying or damaging toits interests or the interest of its friends and allies. The UN is not therefore a great balance to the US, Nevertheless, in a unipolar world in which the US is dominant, only the UN can initiate the talks between the US and various countries on different issues.

What is Interdependence?,Growing connections and links between societies and issues are called Interdependence.,"impact is felt outside their immediate local, national or regional environment at the international level. Q.2. What is global ‘mutual connection’? What are its components? [NCERT] Ans. Global mutual connection means the free flow of ideas, capital commodities and people from one part of the world to another. In present times, different parts of world have come close to each other. And its credit goes to the development of means of communication. The invention of telegraph, the telephone and the microchips has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. Printing connected people living at different corners of the globe. But Globalisation however does not emerge merely because of the availability of improved communications. But people in different partsof the world recognise that they are connected to each other. Currently, we are aware of the fact that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on another part of the world like Bird Flu or Tsunami. Q.3. How do technologies contribute in the direction of globalisation? Explain. [CBSE Delhi 2013, CBSE Delhi 2015] Or How has technology contributed to the globalisation? [NCERT] Ans. Revolution in Communication Technique: Technology remains a critical element. There is no doubt that the invention of telegraph, the telephone, and the microchip in more recent times has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. When printing initially came into being, it laid the basis for the creation of nationalism. Technology has affected us at individual and collective levels. Technological advancements have stimulated the transfer and movement of capital, thoughts, commodities and people from one part of the world to another and that too, easily. The movement of capital and commodities has been more than the movement of peoples across different parts of the world. Q.4. Why is globalisation a multidimensional concept? Ans. Globalisation is a multidimensional concept because it cannot be limited within a certain sphere. Its effect can be seen in all the sectors like economic, political and cultural. It would be a blunder to accept globalisation only as an economic, political or a cultural event. The impact of globalisation is vastly uneven— it affects some parts more than others. Q.5. Define globalisation. Explain any one criticism for globalisation. [CBSE Delhi (C) 2014]
 3. Balance of power: Every country works hard to maintain a favourable balance of power, especially in military. For example, purchasing weapons from foreign countries for modernisation of military by India and Pakistan. 4. To form alliances: Some countries form an alliance to increase their military power and coordinate their actions to deter or defend against military attack done on any of the country. For example, ‘NATO’ and ‘Warsaw Pact’ were established by America and USSR respectively. Q.4. Explain the process of confidence building under traditional security conception. Ans. Traditional security also accepts confidence building as a means of avoiding violence. Confidence building is a process in which countries share their thoughts and information with their rivals. They tell each other about their military intentions and, up to a point, their military plans. This is a way to show that they are not planning a surprise attack. They also tell each other about the kind of forces they possess, and they may share information on where those forces are deployed. In short, confidence building is a process designed to ensure that rivals do not go to war through misunderstanding or misperception. Q.5. Explain the importance of cooperation in the field of ‘Traditional Security.’ [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. The importance of cooperation in the field of ‘Traditional Security’ is disarmament, arms control, and confidence building. Disarmament requires all states to give up certain kinds of weapons. For example, the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and 1992 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) banned the production and possession of these weapons. Arms control regulates the acquisition or development of weapons. The AntiBallistic Missile (ABM) Treaty 1972 tried to stop the United States and the Soviet Union from using ballistic missiles as a defensive shield to launch a nuclear attack. Confidence Building is accepted as a means of avoiding violence. It is a process in which countries share ideas and information with their rivals. Q.6. What is disarmament? Ans. Disarmament literally means ‘not keeping arms’. But no country can safeguard its boundaries without its military capability. So, disarmament refers to limit traditional weapons within a boundary by preventing nuclear weapons. The competition of weapons among countries have caused a global threat to international peace. The need of the hour is to end this competition and establish international peace. Q.7. What are the reasons behind increase in terrorism at international level?
 [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. Following are the reasons behind increasing terrorism on international level: 1. Information and Technology have paved way for terrorism in its way of execution. That is why, terrorism is a global problem all over the world. 2. Globalisation of economy is responsible behind the situations like theft, hijacking plains or planting of bombs, etc. The exchange of currency of any country has become easier for terrorists. 3. There is a competition of selling modernised weapons. The mastermind, government and traders are equally responsible behind spreading terror at individual level. 4. Advanced transport systems and mediums have enhanced terrorism. Q.8. Identify and elaborate any four sources of security threats. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. Following are the new sources of security threats: 1. Terrorism: It refers to political violence that targets civilians deliberately and indiscriminately. International terrorism involves the citizens or territory of more than one country. Terrorist groups seek to change a political context or condition that they do not like by force or threat of force. Civilian targets are usually chosen to terrorise the public and to use the unhappiness of the public as a weapon against national governments or other parties in conflict. 2. Global Poverty: Global Poverty is another source of insecurity. World population now at 650 crore will reach 700 to 800 within 25 years and may eventually level out of 900 to 1000 crore. Currently, half the world’s population growth occurs in just six countries—India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Among the World’s poorest countries, population is expected to triple in the next 50 years, whereas many rich countries will see population’s shrinkage in that period. High growth rate, high per capita income, high Education level and low population growth will make rich states or rich social groups get richer where as low growth rate, low per capita income, low education level and huge population growth reinforce each other to make poor states and poor groups become poorer. 3. Migration: Poverty in the South has also led to large-scale migration to seek a better life, especially better economic opportunities in the North. This has created international political frictions. International law and norms make a distinction between migrants and refugees. States are generally supposed to accept refugees,but they do not have to accept migrants. While refugees leave their country of origin, people who have fled their homes but remain within national borders are called internally displaced people. 4. Health Epidemics: Health Epidemics such as HIV-AIDS, bird flu, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have rapidly spread across countries through migration,

The Secretary General is appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council for a 5-year renewable term. 5 member states should agree. Q.5. Write a short note on the logo of UN. Ans. In logo of UN, the emblem has a world map as it is an international organisation. The map has olive branches around it, which signifies world peace. Q.6. What is Amnesty International? Ans. Amnesty International is an NGO that campaigns for the protection of human rights all over the world. It promotes respect for all the human beings in the universal declaration of human rights. It believes that human rights are interdependent and indivisible. It prepares and publishes reports on human rights. Governments are not always happy with these reports since a major focus of Amnesty is the misconduct of government authorities. Nevertheless, these reports play an important role in research and advocacy on human rights. Q.7. How many members of Security Council of United Nations have veto power? Ans. Five permanent members of United Nations Security Council — 1. United States of America, 2. Britain, 3. Russia, 4. China and 5. France have veto power. Q.8. What is a ‘Veto’ power? Ans. ‘Veto’ power is that power which enables permanent member states of UN to prevent from taking a decision, not matter if rest of the permanent members and non-permanent members have voted in favour of the decision. Q.9. Which are the agencies that deal with economic and social issues in UN? Ans. These agencies are as follows: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

 Q.10. What is Apartheid? What are efforts done by the UN in order to eliminate Apartheid?
 Ans. Apartheid is a discrimination based on colour and breed, which is anti-democratic and antihumanity. Following were the two ways adopted by the UN to eliminate Apartheid in past years: 1. Political constraints were directed by UN in 1954 against the government of South Africa, which favoured Apartheid. 2. Economic constraints against Rhodesia by UN in 1956. Q.11. What do you understand by ‘Human Rights Watch’? Ans. Human Right Watch is international NGO involved in research and advocacy on human rights. It is the largest international human rights organisation in the US. It draws the global media’s attention to human right abuses. It helps in building international coalitions like the campaigns to ban landmines, to stop the use of child soldiers and toestablish the international criminal court. Q.12. Write any two objectives of the ‘Human Rights Watch’. [CBSE Delhi 2010, 2011] Ans. Following are the two main objectives of the Human Rights Watch: 1. To recommend human rights and implement them in all the countries of the world. 2. To eliminate discrimination and exploitation like child abuse, which can be seen among all the nations. Q.13. What are the functions of the Security Council? [NCERT] Ans. Following are the functions of the Security Council: 1. It is responsible for establishing peace in the world and can think of an issue which can pose a threat to the world. 2. It can work on the complaint sent by any country and take actions over dispute or conflict. 3. It can also take military actions to implement decisions taken by the security council. It was the UN which took military action against Iraq. Q.14. Write the full form of IAEA. Why has it been formed? [CBSE Delhi (Comptt.) 2014] Ans. International Atomic Energy Agency. It seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to prevent its use for military purposes. Q.15. What do you understand by International Atomic Energy Agency? Ans.

Which chemicals are responsible behind increasing temperature of Earth’s atmosphere?,The temperature of atmosphere increase due to the spread of chlorofluorocarbon.  ,"[NCERT] Ans. Human is rapidly destroying environment for his development but is causing a serious threat to country. Ecological balance is disturbed due to indiscriminate cutting of trees. Threats to human beings involve water pollution, air pollution, land pollution and noise pollution. Global warming is the consequence of increasing temperature whichis causing temperature of sea to rise. For example, due to global warming, a sea level rise of 1.5–2.0 metres would flood 20 percent of Bangladesh, inundate most of the Maldives, and threaten nearly half the population of Thailand. Q.17. How do per capita income and population growth affect the economic disparity in the world? Suggest any two ways to reduce economic disparity between the poor and the rich at the global level. [CBSE (AI) 2016] Ans. Per Capita income is calculated by dividing the area’s total income by its total population in a particular year. The rise in population causes the income to be divided among more people thereby decreasing the per capita income. SO for a country to grow economically, its income should increase more than its population growth. Income disparity can be decreased in global scale by: (i) There should be a control on population growth through family planning and other means. This would allow for a balanced growth in per capita income and equal distribution of income and wealth. (ii) There should be means to increase total income. This would allow for more income to be distributed among people thereby increasing per capita income and allow people to equally prosper (with wealth and income). Q.18. ‘Epidemic is a big threat to the world’. Explain the statement. Ans. The threat to human security is from epidemic. Health epidemics such as HIVAIDS, bird-flu, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have rapidly spread across countries through migration, business, tourism and military operations. One country’s success or failure in limiting the spread of these diseases affects infections in other countries. By 2003, an estimated 4 crore people infected with HIV-AIDS worldwide, two-thirds of them in Africa and half of the rest in South Asia. In NorthAmerica and other industrialised countries, new drug therapies dramatically lowered the death rate of HIVAIDS in the late of 1990s. But these treatments were too expensive to help poor regions like Africa where it has proved to be a major factor in driving the region backward into deeper poverty. Other new and poorly understood diseases such as ebola virus, hantavirus, and hepatitis C have emerged, while old diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, dengue fever and cholera have mutated into drug resistant forms that are difficult to treat. Epidemics among animals have major economic effects. Since the late 1990s, Britain has lost billions of dollars of income during an outbreak of the

"Correct and rewrite the statement: Resource politics is all about who gets what, when, where and how.","Resource Geopolitics is all about who gets what, when, where and how.","[CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. The Global south believes that global north is responsible for much of the environmental degradation as most of the developments and industrialisation have taken place in the north only. Their contention is that they are still on the path of development and, therefore, should not be subjected to the same restrictions. Countries of the north havea larger responsibility of ecological conservation. This principle was accepted at the Rio Summit 1992 and is popularly called ‘common but differentiated responsibility’. The Kyoto Protocol, which is based on the principles of UNFCCC 1992, also sets targets for industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Q.7. What is resource geopolitics? Explain with an example. Ans. Resource geopolitics is all about who get what, when, where and how one gets the resources? Resources have provided some of the key means and motives of global European power expansion. They have also been the focus of inter-state rivalry. Western geopolitical thinking about resources has been dominated by the relationship of trade, was and power at the core of which were overseas resources and maritime navigation. Since sea power itself is rested on access to timber, naval timber supply became a key priority for major European powers from the 17th century onwards. The critical importance of ensuring uninterrupted supply of strategic resources, in particular oil, was well established during both the First World War and the Second World War. Throughout the cold war, the industrialised countries of the north adopted a number of methods to ensure a steady flow of resources. These included the deployment of military forces near exploitation sites and along sea-lanes of communication, the stockpiling of strategic resources, efforts to prop up friendly governments in producing countries, as well as support to multinational companies and favourable international agreements. Traditional western strategic thinking remained concerned with access to supplies, which might be threatened by the Soviet Union. A particular concern was western control of oil in the gulf and strategic minerals in Southern and Central Africa. After the end of the cold war and the fragmentation of the Soviet Union, the security of supply continues to worry government and business decision with regard to several minerals, in particular, radioactive materials. However, oil continues to be the most important resource in the global strategy. The global economy relied on oil for much of the 20th century as a portable and imperative fuel. The immense wealth associated with oil generates political struggles to control it, and the history of petroleum is also the history of war and struggle. Now here is this more obviously the case than in West Asia and Central Asia. West Asia, specifically the Gulf region, accounts for about 30 per cent of global oil production. But it has about 64 per cent of the planet’s known resources and it therefore the only region able to satisfy any substantial rise in oil demand. Saudi Arabia has a quarter of the world’s total reserves and it is single largest producer. Iraq’s known resources are second only to Saudi Arabia’s. And since substantial portions of Iraqi territory are yet to be fully explored, there is a fair chance that actual reserve might be far larger.

The relevant part of the Rio Declaration says that ‘States shall cooperate in the spirit of global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity of Earth’s ecosystem, in view of the different contributions of global environmental deterioration, states have common but differentiated responsibilities. The developedcountries acknowledge the responsibilities that they bear in the international pursuit of sustainable development in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technological and financial resources they command’. The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also provides that the parties should act to protect the climate system on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Q.3. Explain indigenous people and their rights with respect to India. Ans. The indigenous people bring the issues of environment, resources and politics together. The UN defines indigenous populations as comprising the descendants of peoples who inhabited the present territory of a state at the time when persons of a different culture or ethnic origin arrived there from other parts of the world and overpowered them. Indigenous people today live more in conformity with their particular social, economic, and cultural customs and traditions than the institutions of the country of which they now form a part. In the context of the world politics, the common interest of approximately 30 crore indigenous people spread throughout the world including India, like other social movements, indigenous people speak of their struggles, their agenda and their rights. The indigenous voices in the world politics call for the admission of indigenous people to the world community as equals, indigenous people occupy areas in Central and South America, Africa, India and Southeast Asia. In India, the description ‘Indigenous People’ is usually applied to the scheduled tribes, who constitute nearly 8 per cent of the population of the country. With the exception of small communities of hunters and gatherers, most indigenous population in India depend for their subsistence primarily on the cultivation of land. For Centuries, if notmillennia, they had free access to as much land as they could cultivate. It was only after the establishment of the British colonial rule that areas, which had previously been inhabited by the Scheduled Tribe Communities were subjected to outside forces. Although they enjoy a constitutional protection in political representation, they havenot got much of the benefits of development in the country. In fact, they have paid a huge cost for development since they are the single largest group among the people displaced by various development projects since independence.Issues related to the rights of the indigenous communities have been neglected in domestic and international politics for very long. During the 1970s, growing indigenous leaders from around the world aroused the world a sense of common concern and shared experience. The World Council of Indigenous peoples was formed in 1975. The council became subsequently the first of 11 indigenous NGOs to receive consultative status in the UN.

What has encompassed issues of environment and national resources?,Issues of environment and national resources have been included to world politics.,"Q.1. Explain any three environmental concerns in global politics. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. Environmental concerns in global politics: (i) Cultivated area in world is limited and there is less scope to expand it. It is also a matter of concern that a substantial portion of existing agricultural land is losing fertility and are over-harvested. (ii) Issues related to access safe water and sanitation is very important. According to UNDP report, 1.2 billion people in developing countries have no access to safe water and 2.6 billion have no access to sanitation. (iii) For ecological balance, natural forests are important environmental concerns in global politics. Ecological degradation may affect climate change and it may affect biodiversity on land. (iv) A steady decline in the total amount of ozone in the earth’s stratosphere poses a real danger to ecosystems and human health. (v) The Coastal waters are becoming increasingly polluted largly due to landbased activities. It may cause deterioration in the quality of marine environment. Q.2. What is meant by ‘Common but differentiated responsibility’? How could we implement the idea? [NCERT] Or ‘States have Common but different responsibilities towards environment’. Substantiate your answer with a suitable example. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Or Explain ‘Common but different responsibilities’. How and where has this been pressurised? [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. On the issue of ‘Environmental Protection’, the developing countries agree that ecological degradation is a product of industrial development undertaken by advanced countries. Thus responsibilities of its compensation should be a priority. This argument
 [NCERT] Ans. It has become essential to adopt some ways of environment conservation because of environment degradation due to economic development. But this poses a great threat to pace of economic development. It is a serious challenge in front of world to adopt such approach which neither affect or degrade the environment nor slows down the pace of economic development. From state level to international level steps and initiatives have been taken in this direction. Most significant responses to this challenge have come not from the governments but rather from groups of environmentally conscious volunteers working in different part of the world. It is within social movements that new forms of political action are born on reinvented. These movements raise new ideas and long-term visions of what we should do and what we should not do in our individual and collective lives. Here are just a few examples to show that diversity is an important trait of contemporary environmental movements. 1. Movement in Favour of forest: Forest clearing in the Third world countries at an alarming rate, despite three decades of environmental activism. The destruction of the world’s last remaining grand forests has actually increased in last decade. The forest movement of the South, in Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Malaysia, Indonesia, Continental Africa and India, etc. are faced with enormous pressures. 2. Mines Related Movements: The minerals industry is one of the most powerful forms of industry on the planet. A large number of economies of the South are now being reopened to MNCs through the liberalisation of the global economy. The mineral industry’s extraction of earth, its use of chemicals, its pollution of waterways and land, its clearance of native vegetation, its displacements of community, amongst other factors, continue to invite criticism and resistance in various parts of the world. One example is that of the Philippines, where a vast network of groups and organisations campaigned against the Western Mining Corporation (WMC), an Australia-based multinational company. Much opposition to the company in its own country. 3. Dam Opposing Movements: Another groups of movements are those involved in struggles against mega dams. In every country where a mega dam is being built, one is likely to find an environmental movement opposing it. Increasingly antidam movements are pro-river movements for more sustainable and equitablemanagement of river systems and valleys. The early 1980s saw the first anti-dam movement launched in the North, namely, the campaign to save the Franklin River and its surrounding forests in Australia. At present, there has been a spurt in mega- dam building in the South, from Turkey to Thailand to South Africa, from Indonesia to China. India has had some of the leading anti-dam pro river movements. Narmada Bachao Andolan and Tehri movement are examples of such movements. It is significant note that, in anti-dam and other environmental movements in India, the most important shared idea is nonviolence. Q.20. Explain the arguments in favour of India on environment related issues. [CBSE Delhi 2013]
 Or Explain arguments in favour of India on any three issues of environment. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. Arguments in favour of India on issues related to environment are as follows: 1. India signed and ratified the 1997 Kyoto Protocol in August 2002. India, China and other developing countries were exempted from the requirement of the Kyoto Protocol because their contribution to the emission of greenhouse gases during the industrialisation period was not significant. However, at the G-8 meeting in June2005, India pointed out that the per capita emission rates of developing countries are a tiny fraction of those in the developed world. Following the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. India is of the view that the major responsibility of curbing emission rests with the developed countries, which have accumulated emissions over a long period of time. 2. India’s international negotiating position relies heavily on principles of historical responsibility, as enshrined in UNFCCC. This acknowledges that developed countries are responsible for most historical and current greenhouse gas emissions, and emphasizes that economic and socio development are the first and overridingpriorities of the developing country parties’, so India is wary of recent discussions within UNFCCC about introducing binding commitments on speedily industrialising countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. India feels the controversies that very spirit of UNFCCC. Neither does it seem fair to impose restrictions on India when the country’s rise in per capita carbon emission by 2030 is likely to still represent less than half the world average of 3.8 tonnes in 2000. Indian emissions are predicted to rise from 0.9 tonnes per capita in 2000 to 1.6 tonnes per capita in 2030. 3. The Indian government is already participating in global efforts through a number of programmes. For example, India’s National Auto-fuel Policy mandates cleaner fuels for vehicles. The Energy Conservation Act, passed in 2001, outlines initiatives to improve energy efficiency. Similarly, the Electricity Act of 2003 advocates and promotes the use of renewable energy. Recent trends in importing natural gas and encouraging the adoption of clean coal technologies show that India has been making true efforts. The government also intended to launch a National Mission on Biodiesel, using about 11 million hectares of land to produce bio diesel by 2011-12. And India has one of the largest renewable energy programmes in the world. 4. A review of the implementation of the agreements at the Earth Summit in Rio was undertaken by India at 1997. One of the key conclusions was that there had been no meaningful progress with respect to transfer of new and additional financial resources and environmentally sound technology on concessional terms to developing nations. India encourage SAARC countries to adopt a common position on major global environmental issues, so that the region’s voice carries greater weight. Q.21. Compromise and accommodation are the two essential policies required by states to save planet Earth. Substantiate the statement in the light of the ongoing negotiations between the North and South on environmental issues.
 [NCERT] Ans. Issues of environment is not just related to any individual or country, rather it is related to all those people of countries living on Earth. Thus, in order to save it, mutual and cooperative efforts are required instead of individual efforts. It is important that every country adopts the policy of resolvement and cooperation. There is difference in the approach to environment between the countries of the North and the South. The developed countries of the North want to discuss the environmental issue as it stands now and wants everyone to be equally responsible for ecological conservation. The developing countries of the south feel that much of the ecological degradation in the world is the result of industrial development undertaken by the developed countries. If they have caused more degradation, they must also take more responsibility for undoing the damage now. Moreover, the developing countries are in the process of industrialisation and they must not be subjected to the same restrictions, which apply to the developed countries. Thus, the special needs of the developing countries must be taken into consideration in the development, application, and interpretation of rules of international environmental law. This argument was accepted in the Rio Declaration at the Earth Summit in 1992 and is called the principle of Common but differentiated responsibilities. The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also provides that the parties should act to protect the climate system on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities. The parties to the Convention, agreed that the largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries. It was also acknowledged that per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low. China, India, and other developing countries were, therefore, exempted from the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol. Q.22. What are ‘global commons’? Why is it said that international cooperation over the global commons is not easy? [CBSE Delhi 2016] Ans. Global commons are the resources which are not owned by any one country but rather owned by international community such as earth’s atmosphere, Antarctica, the ocean floor and the outer space. It is difficult to achieve consensus on common environmental agenda. History of outer space as global common shows that the management of these areas is influenced by North East inequalities. Like Earth’s atmosphere and the ocean floor, the crucial issue here is technology and development. The benefits of exploitative activities in outer space are far from being equal either for the present or the future.

Thus, Environment became the priority issue for countries. Q.16. ‘The global economy relied on oil for much of the 20th century.’ Explain. Ans. The global economy relied on oil for much of the 20th century as a portable and imperative fuel. The immense wealth associated with oil generates political struggles to control it, and the history of petroleum is also the history of war and struggle. Nowhere is this more obviously the case than in West Asia and Central Asia. West Asia, specifically the Gulf region, accounts for about 30 per cent of global oil production. But it has about 64 percent of the planet’s known reserve, and is therefore the only region able to satisfy any substantial raise in oil demand. Saudi Arabia has a quarter of the world’s total reserve and is the single target producer. Iraq’s known reserve are second only to Saudi Arabia’s. And since substantial portions of Iraqi territory are yet to be fully explored, there is a fair chance that actual reserve might be far larger. The United States, Europe, Japan, and increasingly India and China, which consume this petroleum, are located at a considerable distance from the region. Q.17. What distinguishes the forest movements of the South from those of the North? Ans. Forest movements of the South and those of the North vary largely. Countries of eastern are believed to be deprived of forests. Human are not seen as part of nature and try to protect environment from human. While most environmental issues in the South are based on the assumption that people live in the forests. Wilderness-oriented perspectives have been predominant in Australia, Scandinavia, North America and New Zealand. In these regions, there are still large tracts of relatively underdeveloped wilderness. Wilderness campaigns are active in the South. In the Phillippines, green organisations fought to protect eagles and other birds of prey from extinctions. In India, a battle goes on to protect the alarmingly low number of Bengal tigers. In Africa, a long campaign has been waged against the ivory trade and the savage slaughter of elephants. All of these campaigns focus on individual species as well as the conservation of the wild habitats, which support them. Many of these campaigns have been initiated and funded by NGOs such as the world wide wildlife fund (WWF), in association with local people. Q.18. What was the ‘Earth Summit’? How far did the summit prove to be useful? Explain. [CBSE (AI) 2016 Ans. Earth Summit was a conference on environment and development held in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) in June 1992. (i) This Summit produced conventions dealing with climate change, biodiversity and forestry. (ii) It recommended a list of development practices called ‘Agenda 21’. Q.19. The most serious challenge before the states is pursuing economic development without causing further damage to the global environment. How could we achieve this? Explain with a few examples.
 [NCERT] Ans. It has become essential to adopt some ways of environment conservation because of environment degradation due to economic development. But this poses a great threat to pace of economic development. It is a serious challenge in front of world to adopt such approach which neither affect or degrade the environment nor slows down the pace of economic development. From state level to international level steps and initiatives have been taken in this direction. Most significant responses to this challenge have come not from the governments but rather from groups of environmentally conscious volunteers working in different part of the world. It is within social movements that new forms of political action are born on reinvented. These movements raise new ideas and long-term visions of what we should do and what we should not do in our individual and collective lives. Here are just a few examples to show that diversity is an important trait of contemporary environmental movements. 1. Movement in Favour of forest: Forest clearing in the Third world countries at an alarming rate, despite three decades of environmental activism. The destruction of the world’s last remaining grand forests has actually increased in last decade. The forest movement of the South, in Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Malaysia, Indonesia, Continental Africa and India, etc. are faced with enormous pressures. 2. Mines Related Movements: The minerals industry is one of the most powerful forms of industry on the planet. A large number of economies of the South are now being reopened to MNCs through the liberalisation of the global economy. The mineral industry’s extraction of earth, its use of chemicals, its pollution of waterways and land, its clearance of native vegetation, its displacements of community, amongst other factors, continue to invite criticism and resistance in various parts of the world. One example is that of the Philippines, where a vast network of groups and organisations campaigned against the Western Mining Corporation (WMC), an Australia-based multinational company. Much opposition to the company in its own country. 3. Dam Opposing Movements: Another groups of movements are those involved in struggles against mega dams. In every country where a mega dam is being built, one is likely to find an environmental movement opposing it. Increasingly antidam movements are pro-river movements for more sustainable and equitablemanagement of river systems and valleys. The early 1980s saw the first anti-dam movement launched in the North, namely, the campaign to save the Franklin River and its surrounding forests in Australia. At present, there has been a spurt in mega- dam building in the South, from Turkey to Thailand to South Africa, from Indonesia to China. India has had some of the leading anti-dam pro river movements. Narmada Bachao Andolan and Tehri movement are examples of such movements. It is significant note that, in anti-dam and other environmental movements in India, the most important shared idea is nonviolence. Q.20.

 "
What is the Global Warming?,World’s temperature rises due to the influence of Global Warming.,"[NCERT] Ans. Human is rapidly destroying environment for his development but is causing a serious threat to country. Ecological balance is disturbed due to indiscriminate cutting of trees. Threats to human beings involve water pollution, air pollution, land pollution and noise pollution. Global warming is the consequence of increasing temperature whichis causing temperature of sea to rise. For example, due to global warming, a sea level rise of 1.5–2.0 metres would flood 20 percent of Bangladesh, inundate most of the Maldives, and threaten nearly half the population of Thailand. Q.17. How do per capita income and population growth affect the economic disparity in the world? Suggest any two ways to reduce economic disparity between the poor and the rich at the global level. [CBSE (AI) 2016] Ans. Per Capita income is calculated by dividing the area’s total income by its total population in a particular year. The rise in population causes the income to be divided among more people thereby decreasing the per capita income. SO for a country to grow economically, its income should increase more than its population growth. Income disparity can be decreased in global scale by: (i) There should be a control on population growth through family planning and other means. This would allow for a balanced growth in per capita income and equal distribution of income and wealth. (ii) There should be means to increase total income. This would allow for more income to be distributed among people thereby increasing per capita income and allow people to equally prosper (with wealth and income). Q.18. ‘Epidemic is a big threat to the world’. Explain the statement. Ans. The threat to human security is from epidemic. Health epidemics such as HIVAIDS, bird-flu, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have rapidly spread across countries through migration, business, tourism and military operations. One country’s success or failure in limiting the spread of these diseases affects infections in other countries. By 2003, an estimated 4 crore people infected with HIV-AIDS worldwide, two-thirds of them in Africa and half of the rest in South Asia. In NorthAmerica and other industrialised countries, new drug therapies dramatically lowered the death rate of HIVAIDS in the late of 1990s. But these treatments were too expensive to help poor regions like Africa where it has proved to be a major factor in driving the region backward into deeper poverty. Other new and poorly understood diseases such as ebola virus, hantavirus, and hepatitis C have emerged, while old diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, dengue fever and cholera have mutated into drug resistant forms that are difficult to treat. Epidemics among animals have major economic effects. Since the late 1990s, Britain has lost billions of dollars of income during an outbreak of the

When and where was world’s first anti-dam movement launched?,"The early 1980s saw the first anti-dam movement launched in the North, namely, the campaign to save the Franklin River and its surrounding forests in Australia. ","Ans. At present, most of the steps to check environmental degradation are such that no single government can address them fully. Therefore, they have to become part of world politics. They fall within the scope of contemporary world politics. Q.7. Write a short note on Movements against Mega-dams. Ans. In every country where a mega dam is being built, one is likely to find an environmental movement opposing it.

The early 1980s saw the anti-dam movement launched in the North, namely the campaign tosave the Franklin River and its surrounding forests in Australia. This was a wilderness and forest campaign as well as anti dam campaign. At present, there has been a surge in mega-dam building in the south, from Turkey to Thailand to South Africa, from Indonesia to China. India has had some of the leading anti-dam, pro river movements. Narmada Bachao Andolan, Tehri-dam-movement are good example of it. Main features of such Andolan is the shared idea of non-violence. Q.8. Suggest any two steps to be taken by the government to check pollution and save environment. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans.

What is the main cause of climatic change and global warming?,Industrialisation is the main cause for climatic change and Global warming.,"[NCERT] Ans. Human is rapidly destroying environment for his development but is causing a serious threat to country. Ecological balance is disturbed due to indiscriminate cutting of trees. Threats to human beings involve water pollution, air pollution, land pollution and noise pollution. Global warming is the consequence of increasing temperature whichis causing temperature of sea to rise. For example, due to global warming, a sea level rise of 1.5–2.0 metres would flood 20 percent of Bangladesh, inundate most of the Maldives, and threaten nearly half the population of Thailand. Q.17. How do per capita income and population growth affect the economic disparity in the world? Suggest any two ways to reduce economic disparity between the poor and the rich at the global level. [CBSE (AI) 2016] Ans. Per Capita income is calculated by dividing the area’s total income by its total population in a particular year. The rise in population causes the income to be divided among more people thereby decreasing the per capita income. SO for a country to grow economically, its income should increase more than its population growth. Income disparity can be decreased in global scale by: (i) There should be a control on population growth through family planning and other means. This would allow for a balanced growth in per capita income and equal distribution of income and wealth. (ii) There should be means to increase total income. This would allow for more income to be distributed among people thereby increasing per capita income and allow people to equally prosper (with wealth and income). Q.18. ‘Epidemic is a big threat to the world’. Explain the statement. Ans. The threat to human security is from epidemic. Health epidemics such as HIVAIDS, bird-flu, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have rapidly spread across countries through migration, business, tourism and military operations. One country’s success or failure in limiting the spread of these diseases affects infections in other countries. By 2003, an estimated 4 crore people infected with HIV-AIDS worldwide, two-thirds of them in Africa and half of the rest in South Asia. In NorthAmerica and other industrialised countries, new drug therapies dramatically lowered the death rate of HIVAIDS in the late of 1990s. But these treatments were too expensive to help poor regions like Africa where it has proved to be a major factor in driving the region backward into deeper poverty. Other new and poorly understood diseases such as ebola virus, hantavirus, and hepatitis C have emerged, while old diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, dengue fever and cholera have mutated into drug resistant forms that are difficult to treat.

[CBSE Delhi 2015] Or Who are indigenous people? Describe any four problems of the indigenous people. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Indigenous People The UN defined indigenous populations comprising of the descendants of people who inhabited the present territory of a country at the time when persons of a different culture or ethnic origin arrived there from other parts of the world and overcome them. Threats to their Survival (i) The indigenous people in the world demand to be treated as equal. They appeal to governments to come to terms with the continuing existence of indigenous nations as enduring communities with an identity of their own. (ii) The loss of land which also means the loss of an economic resource base is the most obvious threat to the survival of indigenous people. (iii) Although they enjoy a constitutional protection in political representation, they have not got much of the benefits of development in the country. They have paid a huge cost for development, since they are the single largest group among the people displaced by various developmental projects since independence.
