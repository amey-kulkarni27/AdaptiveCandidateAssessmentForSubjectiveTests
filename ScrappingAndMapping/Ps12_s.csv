 Q. 10. Describe the unconscious as stated by Freud. Ans. According to Freud, the unconscious is a reservoir of instinctive or animal drives, which also stores all ideas and wishes that are concealed from conscious awareness, perhaps because they lead to psychological conflicts.

People constantly struggle to find either some socially acceptable ways to express unconscious impulses, or to keep those impulses away from being expressed. Unsuccessful resolution of conflicts results in abnormal behaviour. Analysis of forgetting, mispronunciations, jokes and dreams provide us a means to approach the unconscious.

 "
Describe the structure of personality.,"According to Freud, there are three structural elements of personality: i.  ii.  iii.  Id: It deals with immediate gratification of primitive needs, sexual desires and aggressive impulses. It is based on the pleasure principle in which people seek pleasure and try to avoid pain. For example, a boy who wants an ice-cream cone, will grab the cone and eat it. Ego: It grows out of id, and seeks to satisfy an individual’s instinctual needs in accordance with reality. It works on the reality principle. For example, a boy who wants an ice-cream cone, will ask for permission to eat the cone. Superego: The superego tells the id and ego whether gratification in a particular instance is ethical. It is the administrative division of personality. For example a boy who wants an icecream cone, his superego will indicate whether his behaviour is morally correct. Obtaining the ice-cream cone will create guilt, fear or anxiety in the boy.  Unconscious is composed of these three competing forces. In some people, the id is stronger while in others it is the superego. The relative strength of the id, ego and superego determines each person’s stability. The instinctual life force that energizes the id is called libido. It works on the pleasure principle, and seeks immediate gratification.","Id: It deals with immediate gratification of primitive needs, sexual desires and aggressive impulses.

 Q. 15. Discuss Erich Fromm’s theory of personality Ans. Erich Fromm viewed human beings as social beings who could be understood in terms of the relationship with others. He argued that psychological qualities such as growth and realization of potentials resulted from desire for freedom and striving for justice and truth. Q. 16. Discuss Erikson’s concept of identity crisis. [CBSE Delhi 2016; (AI) 2016] Ans. Erik Erikson laid stress on rational, conscious ego processes in personality development. He viewed development as a life-ling process with a central place granted to ego identity. His concept of identity crisis of adolescent age has shown considerable attention. The primary task of adolescence is to establish an identity separate from their parents. In this process, the adolescents experience conflict with their parents and with themselves. Those who are not able to cope with this identity crisis are confused. This ‘identity confusion’, according to Erikson, can lead them to isolate themselves from their peers and family, or they lose their identity in the crowd. Adolescents on one hand may desire independence and at the same time show a great deal of dependence on their parents. Rapid fluctuations of self-confidence and insecurity are typical of this stage. Q. 17. Describe the behavioural approach to the study of personality. [CBSE Delhi 2016; (AI) 2013] Ans. Behaviourists believe in data which are definable, observable, measurable and scientifically verifiable. They focus on learning of stimulus-response connections and their reinforcement. Personality is not biologically determined and is learned through classical conditioning, operant conditioning and modelling. The principles of theories of classical conditioning (Pavlov), instrumental conditioning (Skinner) and observational learning (Bandura) have been widely used in developing personality theories. A response is the structural unit of behaviour. If a particular response is positively reinforced, then it is repeated again and again and becomes a part of habit. Personality is basically a bundle of habits. For example, initially children eat vegetables such as spinach, pumpkin and gourds because of appreciation or reinforcement from their parents, but later they develop the taste of these vegetables. Q. 18. Describe the cultural approach to the study of personality. Ans. This approach attempts to understand personality in relation to the features of ecological and cultural environment. In agricultural societies, children are socialized to be obedient to elders, nurturant to youngsters and responsible to their duties. In contrast hunting-gathering societies show independence, autonomy and are achievement-oriented.
 Q. 15. Discuss Erich Fromm’s theory of personality Ans. Erich Fromm viewed human beings as social beings who could be understood in terms of the relationship with others. He argued that psychological qualities such as growth and realization of potentials resulted from desire for freedom and striving for justice and truth. Q. 16. Discuss Erikson’s concept of identity crisis. [CBSE Delhi 2016; (AI) 2016] Ans. Erik Erikson laid stress on rational, conscious ego processes in personality development. He viewed development as a life-ling process with a central place granted to ego identity. His concept of identity crisis of adolescent age has shown considerable attention. The primary task of adolescence is to establish an identity separate from their parents. In this process, the adolescents experience conflict with their parents and with themselves. Those who are not able to cope with this identity crisis are confused. This ‘identity confusion’, according to Erikson, can lead them to isolate themselves from their peers and family, or they lose their identity in the crowd. Adolescents on one hand may desire independence and at the same time show a great deal of dependence on their parents. Rapid fluctuations of self-confidence and insecurity are typical of this stage. Q. 17. Describe the behavioural approach to the study of personality. [CBSE Delhi 2016; (AI) 2013] Ans. Behaviourists believe in data which are definable, observable, measurable and scientifically verifiable. They focus on learning of stimulus-response connections and their reinforcement. Personality is not biologically determined and is learned through classical conditioning, operant conditioning and modelling. The principles of theories of classical conditioning (Pavlov), instrumental conditioning (Skinner) and observational learning (Bandura) have been widely used in developing personality theories. A response is the structural unit of behaviour. If a particular response is positively reinforced, then it is repeated again and again and becomes a part of habit. Personality is basically a bundle of habits. For example, initially children eat vegetables such as spinach, pumpkin and gourds because of appreciation or reinforcement from their parents, but later they develop the taste of these vegetables.

Humanistic approach to personality was proposed by Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow, emphasise personal responsibility and innovate tendencies towards personal growth. They focus on the importance of people’s subjective attitudes, feelings and beliefs, especially with regard to the self. Human beings are most creative, growing, fully functioning and self-actualising people, fulfillment is the motivating force for personality development. Psychologically healthy persons live life to the fullest. Two assumptions by Rogers are that Behaviour is goal directed or worthwhile People choose adaptive and self-actualising behaviour Humanistic theories emphasise personal responsibility and innovate tendencies toward personal growth. They focus on the importance of people’s subjective attitudes, feelings and beliefs especially with regard to the self. Human beings are most creative, growing, fully functioning and self-actualising people. Psychologically healthy persons live life to the fullest.Rogers suggest that each person has a concept of ideal self, what a person would like to be. When there is a correspondence between real self and ideal self, a person is generally happy. Discrepancy between real self and ideal self results in unhappiness and dissatisfaction. People have a tendency to maximize self-concept through selfactualisation. When a person has high self-concept, s/he has a high selfesteem and vice-versa. People with high self-esteem are flexible and open to new experiences. An atmosphere of unconditional positive regard must be created in order to ensure enhancement of people’s self-concept. This theory emphasizes the significance of positive aspects of life which may be supported by the following diagram.
 in which the client arrives at the solutions through the process of personal growth. Thus the client understands oneself and one’s aspirations, emotions and motives. The principles underlying humanistic existential psychotherapy are i. ii.
 iii.
 Psychological distress arises from feelings of loneliness, alienation and inability to find meaning and genuine fulfillment in life. Human beings are motivated by the desire for personal growth and selfactualisation, and an innate need to grow emotionally. When these needs are curbed by society and family, human beings experience psychological distress. Frustration of self actualisation also causes distress. The humanistic-existential therapies encourage personal growth and actualise the potential. Self actualisation requires free emotional expression. The family and society curb emotional expression which leads to destructive behaviour and negative emotions by thwarting the process of emotional expression. The therapist is merely facilitator and guide. It is the client who is responsible for the success of the therapy by the process of self-growth through which healing takes place.

What do you understand by personality? Explain assessment of personality using behavioural analysis. [CBSE Delhi 2011; (AI) 2011, 2015] Ans. Personality refers to our characteristic ways of responding to individuals and situations. For example, a person who is socially active, assertive, talkative and funloving is an extravert personality. The methods for personality assessment using behavioural analysis are: Interview: This involves seeking information from a person on a one-to-one basis. This can be structured or unstructured. For example, an employer selecting employees for his/her organization. Behaviour ratings are used for assessment of personality in educational and industrial settings. In this, individuals are put into certain categories in terms of their behavioural qualities. These ratings have drawbacks such as halo effect, middle category bias and extreme response bias. This method is used in obtaining peer assessment. In this each person is asked to choose one or more persons of the group with whom s/he would like to work, study, play or participate in an activity. The person may be asked to specify the reason for his or her choices. The most commonly used test of this kind is the situational stress test. It involves a kind of role-playing in which a person performs a task with other persons, who are noncooperative and interfering. Thus, this test provides us with information about how a person behaves under stressful situations. Q. 6. Describe the key features of self-report measures used in personality assessment. Ans.

Explain three self-report measures with examples. ,"Self-report measures are structured measures that require subjects to give responses using some kind of rating scale. Some of the self-report measures are: i.  ii.  iii.  The Minnesota Multiphase Personality Inventory (MMPI): It contains 567 statements in which the subject has to state true or false. The test is divided into 10 subsets and diagnoses depression, hysteria, psychopathology, schizophrenia, mania, social-introversion etc. Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ): This test measures personality traits on three dimensions Introversion-Extraversion, Neuroticism-Emotional stability and Psychoticism-Sociability. Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16 PF): This test was developed by Cattell. On the basis of his studies, he identified a large set of personality descriptors, which were subjected to factor analysis to identify the basic personality structure. This test provides with declarative statements and the subject responds to a specific situation by choosing from a set of given alternatives.  ","In psychology, a self-report is a test, measure, or survey that relies on the individual’s own report of their symptoms, behaviors, beliefs, or attitudes. Selfreport data is gathered from paper-and-pencil or electronic format, or sometimes through an interview. Self-reports are commonly used in psychological studies largely because much valuable and diagnostic information about a person is revealed to a researcher or a clinician based on a person’s report on himself or herself. One of the most commonlyused self-report tools is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) for personality testing. One of the primary advantages of self-report data is that it can be easily obtained. It is one of the instrumental ways that clinicians diagnose their patients—by asking questions. Those making the self-report are usually familiar with filling outquestionnaires. For research, it is an inexpensive tool that can

Over sessions the client is able to imagine more severe fear provoking situations while maintaining the relaxation. The client gets systematically desensitized to the fear. The process of systematic desensitization is based on the principle of reciprocal inhibition which states that two mutually opposing forces inhibits the weaker force.,"Systematic desensitization is a technique used in behavior therapy introduced by Wolpe for treating phobias or irrational fears. During behaviour therapy treatment is to extinguish or eliminate the faulty behaviors which cause distress such as fear or phobia of lizards and substitute them with adaptive behaviour patterns.

The process of systematic desensitization is based on the principle of reciprocal inhibition which states that two mutually opposing forces inhibit the weaker force. According to Psychanalysts, intra-psychic conflicts are the source of psychological problems due to unresolved childhood fear of lizards. The unfulfilled desires of childhood and unresolved childhood fears lead to intra-psychic conflicts. i. ii.
 A child who shows phobic reaction to lizards has had a traumatic experience of the phobic stimulus. The fear was either repressed or displaced.
 Psychoanalytic therapy uses the methods of free association and reporting of dreams to elicit the thoughts and feelings of the client. A therapeutic relationship is established and the client feels comfortable, the therapist makes him/her lie down on the couch, close his/her eyes and asks him/her to speak whatever comes to mind without censoring it in anyway. The client is encouraged to freely associate one thought with another, and this method is called the method of free association. A relaxed and trusting atmosphere is created and as the therapist does not interrupt the free flow of ideas, desires and the conflicts of the unconscious, which had been suppressed by the ego, emerge into the conscious mind. Along with this technique, the client is asked to write down his/her dreams upon waking up. According to psychoanalysts, dreams are symbols of unfulfilled desires and are the royal road to the unconscious. This material is interpreted to the client to help him/her confront and resolve the conflicts and thus overcome problems. The therapist understands and interprets the thoughts and feelings of the

 client. The client’s symptoms and distresses reduce as a consequence of the development of emotional insight. Q. 4. Describe the method of treatment in behavior therapy. Ans. During behaviour therapy treatment is to extinguish or eliminate the faulty behaviors which cause distress and substitute them with adaptive behaviour patterns. Behavioural analysis is to find malfunctioning behaviours, the antecedents of faulty learning and the factors that maintain or continue faulty learning. Malfunctioning behaviours are those behaviours that cause distress to the client. Antecedent factors are those causes which predispose the person to indulge in that behaviour. Maintaining factors are those which lead to the persistence of the faulty behaviour. For example, in the malfunctioning behavior of smoking, the anxiety-provoking situation is the causative or antecedent factor. The feeling of relief is the maintaining factor to continue smoking. The method of treatment is through establishing antecedent operations and consequent operations. Antecedent operations control behaviour by changing something that precedes a behavior. Establishing operation is to increase or decrease the reinforcing value of a particular consequence. For example, if a child gives trouble in eating dinner, an establishing operation would be to decrease the quantity of food served at tea time. Praising the child when s/he eats properly tends to encourage this behaviour. The antecedent operation is the reduction of food at tea time and the consequent operation is praising the child for eating dinner. Q. 5. State the techniques used in behaviour therapy. 2012]
 "
Describe Rational Emotive Therapy.,"Psychological distress is caused by irrational thoughts and beliefs. The distorted perception of the antecedent event due to irrational beliefs leads to a consequence, i.e., negative emotions and behaviours. In the process of RET, the irrational beliefs are refuted by the therapist through the process of non-directive questioning. The nature of questioning is gentle, without probing or being directive.","Psychological distress arises from feelings of loneliness, alienation and inability to find meaning and genuine fulfillment in life. Human beings are motivated by the desire for personal growth and selfactualisation, and an innate need to grow emotionally. When these needs are curbed by society and family, human beings experience psychological distress. Frustration of self actualisation also causes distress. The humanistic-existential therapies encourage personal growth and actualise the potential. Self actualisation requires free emotional expression. The family and society curb emotional expression which leads to destructive behaviour and negative emotions by thwarting the process of emotional expression. The therapist is merely facilitator and guide. It is the client who is responsible for the success of the therapy by the process of self-growth through which healing takes place.

Irrational beliefs are assessed through questionnaires and interviews and are refuted by the therapist through nondirective questioning. The nature of questioning is gentle without probing or being directive. The questions make the client to think deeper into his/her assumptions about life and problems. Gradually the client is able to change  the irrational beliefs by making a change in his/her philosophy about life. The rational belief system replaces the irrational belief system and there is reduction in psychological distress.","Q. 2. How is behaviour therapy used to treat phobia?

[CBSE (AI) 2011] OR Explain with examples that how cognitive distortions take place. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Aaron Beck states that childhood experiences provided by family and society develop core schemas or systems. For example, a client, who was neglected by the parents as a child, develops the core schema ‘I am not wanted’. During the course of life, a critical incident occurs in his/her life. S/he is publicly ridiculed by the teacher in school. The critical incident triggers the core schema of ‘I am not wanted’ leading to the development of negative automatic thoughts. These negative thoughts lead to cognitive distortions such as ‘I am ugly’, ‘I am stupid’, ‘Nobody loves me’ which are called dysfunctional cognitive structures. Repeated occurrence of these thoughts leads to development of feelings of anxiety and depression. The therapist uses gentle, nonthreatening questioning by which the client thinks in the direction opposite to negative automatic thoughts and gains insight of his dysfunctional schemas and achieves cognitive restructuring which reduces anxiety and depression. Q. 6. Mention the therapy that encourages the client to seek personal growth and actualise their potential. Give its salient features.

 Ans. The aim during the treatment of psychological disorders is to reduce the symptoms and improve the functioning or quality of life. Rehabilitation is required to help patients to become self-sufficient. In rehabilitation, the patients are given occupational therapy, social skills training and vocational therapy. In occupational therapy, the patients are taught skills such as candle making, paper bag making and weaving to help them to form a work discipline. Social skills training helps the patients to develop interpersonal skills through role-play, imitation and instruction. The objective is to teach the patient to function in a social group. Cognitive retraining is given to improve the basic cognitive functions of attention, memory and executive functions. After the patient improves sufficiently, vocational training is given wherein the patient is helped to gain skills to undertake productive employment. Q. 12. Explain the concept of ‘unconditional positive regard’.
 There is systematic application of principles underlying the different theories of therapy, Persons who have received practical training under expert supervision can practice psychotherapy, and not everybody. An untrained person may unintentionally cause more harm than any good, The therapeutic situation involves a therapist and a client who seeks and receives help for his/her emotional problems, The interaction of these two persons – the therapist and the client – results in the consolidation or formation of the therapeutic relationship. This is a confidential,interpersonal and dynamic relationship. This human relationship is central to any sort of psychological therapy and is the vehicle for change.

A child learns these values through the process of conditioning, socialization in the family, peer groups and with other significant members of society. Mass media such as television and internet contribute to the development of values","Acquisition of values is a gradual process which becomes stable with age. Young children exhibit more frequent changes in their preferences like favourite friends, colours, games, animals, school subjects. These preferences become stabilized in older children or adults. Values or beliefs about what is right or wrong, are internalized by the child at a very early age through imitation and modeling of parents or significant others. Parents influence the development of values through rewards, punishments, use of discipline and teaching moral behaviour. Children learn about their culture, customs, rituals, manners, loyalties and prejudices of the group of which they are a part. Children learn to be obedient to their elders and nurture those younger to him.

OR Elaborate one theory representing information processing approach Ans. Gardner in his theory of multiple intelligences described eight types of intelligence: Howard Gardner proposed the Theory of Multiple Intelligences. According to him, intelligence is not a single entity but distinct types of intelligences exist. Each of these intelligences is independent of each other which means that if a person exhibits one type of intelligence, it does not necessarily indicate being high or low on other types of intelligences. He described eight types of intelligence. They are as follows: I.

II.  III.  Arousal/Attention: An optimal level of arousal focuses our attention to the relevant aspects of a problem. Too much or too little arousal would interfere with attention. Simultaneous and Successive Processing: Information is integrated into our knowledge system simultaneously or successively. In simultaneous processing, relations among various concepts are integrated into a meaningful pattern for comprehension. For example, grasping the meaning and relationship between abstract figures in Raven’s Progressive Matrices.Successive processing takes place when you remember all the information serially so that recall of one leads to the recall of another.

Describe the development of values.,"Values refer to beliefs, an individual’s preferences, aspirations and standards about what is desirable or undesirable by an individual or a community. You show respect towards parents and elders, help the needy, believe that behaving in certain ways is right, and behaving in certain other ways is incorrect. A child learns these values through the process of conditioning, socialization in the family, peer groups and with other significant members of society. Mass media such as television and internet contribute to the development of values.  ","Acquisition of values is a gradual process which becomes stable with age. Young children exhibit more frequent changes in their preferences like favourite friends, colours, games, animals, school subjects. These preferences become stabilized in older children or adults. Values or beliefs about what is right or wrong, are internalized by the child at a very early age through imitation and modeling of parents or significant others. Parents influence the development of values through rewards, punishments, use of discipline and teaching moral behaviour. Children learn about their culture, customs, rituals, manners, loyalties and prejudices of the group of which they are a part. Children learn to be obedient to their elders and nurture those younger to him.
 Q. 4. What do you understand by value preferences? Ans. Western societies are individualistic societies which stress individual goals over the goals of the family, society or to the group to which they belong. They place greater emphasis on values such as self-reliance, self-sufficiency, privacy, individual achievement and freedom. On the other hand, Indian societies are interdependent with others in the family or the community to which they belong. They sacrifice their personal

Explain ‘negative reinforcement’ and ‘aversive conditioning’ techniques of behaviour modification. ,"Negative reinforcement refers to following an undesired response with an outcome that is painful or not liked. For example, the teacher reprimands a child who shouts in class. Aversive conditioning refers to repeated association of undesired response with an aversive consequence. For example, an alcoholic is given a mild electric shock and asked to smell the alcohol which leads to his leaving alcohol. ","Q. 6. Explain ‘positive reinforcement’.
 [CBSE Delhi 2011]
 Ans. Positive reinforcement refers to following a desired response with an outcome that is liked. If an adaptive behaviour occurs rarely, positive reinforcement increases the deficit. If a child does not do homework regularly, positive reinforcement may be used by the child’s mother by preparing the child’s favourite dish which increases the behaviour of doing homework at appointed time. Q. 7. Explain ‘token economy technique’ for changing behaviour. Ans. In token economy persons with behavioural problems can be given a token as a reward every time a wanted behaviour occurs. The tokens are collected and exchanged for a reward such as outing for the patient as a treat. Q. 8. Explain ‘vicarious learning’.

What are the properties/features of attitude?,"The properties/features of attitude are described below: i.  ii. iii.  iv.  Valence: Valence of an attitude tells us whether an attitude is positive or negative towards the attitude object. For example, an attitude towards a nuclear research is expressed on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (Very Bad), 2 (Bad), 3 (Neutral), 4 (Good) and 5 (Very Good). A rating of 4 or 5 indicates a positive attitude towards nuclear research while a rating of 1 or 2 indicates a negative attitude and a rating of 3 indicates a neutral attitude. Extremeness: The extremeness of an attitude indicates how positive or negative an attitude is. A rating of 1 or 5 indicate extreme attitudes. Simplicity or Complexity (Multiplexity): An attitude system is said to be ‘simple’ if it contains one or a few attitudes and complex if it is made of many attitudes. For example, an attitude towards a person is a simple attitude while an attitude towards health and well-being is a complex attitude consisting of attitude towards physical and mental health, views about happiness and well-being etc. Centrality: A central attitude would influence the other attitudes in an attitude system. For example, in an attitude towards world peace, a negative attitude towards high military expenditure is present as the central attitude and influences all other attitudes in the multiple attitude system.

Explain how attitudes are formed. Explain the conditions which lead to the learning of attitudes. ,"The process of attitude formation takes place in the following ways i.  ii.  Learning attitudes by association: A positive attitude towards the subject is learned through positive association between a teacher and a student in school. In other words, students often develop a liking for a particular subject because of the teacher. Learning attitudes by being rewarded or punished: If an individual is praised for showing a particular attitude, chances are high that s/he will develop the attitude further. For example, if a teenager does yogasanas regularly and gets the honour of being Miss Good Health in her school, she may develop a positive attitude toward yoga and health in general. Similarly, if a child constantly falls ill because he/she eats junk food instead of proper meal, then the child is likely to develop a negative attitude towards junk food, and also a positive attitude towards eating healthy food.  iii.  iv.  v.  Learning attitudes through modeling (observing others): We learn attitudes through association and through reward and punishment. For example, children form a respectful attitude towards elders by observing that their parents show respect for elders and are appreciated for it. Learning attitudes through group or cultural norms: Learning attitudes through group or cultural norms is through association, reward or punishment and modeling. For example, offering money, sweets, fruit and flowers in a place of worship is a normative behavior in some religions. When individuals see that such behaviour is shown by others and is socially approved, they develop a positive attitude towards such behaviour. Learning through exposure to information: With the huge amount of information that is being provided through media, both positive and negative attitudes are being formed. By reading the biographies of self-actualised person, an individual may develop a positive attitude towards hard work.

How Fritz Heider proposed the process of attitude change?,"The concept of balance proposed by Fritz Heider is described in the form of P-O-X triangle. Attitude changes if there is a state of imbalance between P-O attitude and O-Xattitude and P-X attitude. For example, in the study of attitude towards dowry(X), a person (P) has a positive attitude towards dowry (P-X positive). P is planning to get his son married to the daughter of some person (O) who has a negative attitude towards dowry (O-X negative). Here P-X is positive, O-P is positive but O-X is negative. That is, there are 2 positives and 1 negative in the triangle. This is a situation of imbalance. Imbalance on POX triangle is found when i. ii.

For example, consider the case of the following two ideas or cognitions: Cognition 1: Pan masala causes mouth cancer which is fatal. Cognition 2: I eat pan masala. Here the two ideas are dissonant in the attitude towards pan masala. Therefore, one of these ideas will have to be changed so that consonance can be attained. Thus, to remove or reduce the dissonance, change Cognition 2. Thus Cognition 2 will become:  I will stop eating pan masala.

[CBSE Delhi 2015, (AI) 2015] Ans. Social cognition refers to all those psychological processes that deal with the gathering and processing of information related to social objects. For example, a teacher’s conclusions regarding a student’s behavior in school are quite different from his mother’s conclusion who observes him at home. Attitudes, impression formation and attribution are such processes which involve mental activities related to gathering and processing of information about the social world. Collectively this is called social cognition. Schemas guide social cognition. A schema is defined as a mental structure that provides a framework, set of rules or guidelines for processing information about any object. Schemas are the basic units stored in our memory and in case of social cognition; the basic units are social schemas. Most of the schemas are in the form of categories or classes. Schemas that function in the form of categories are called prototypes. Schemas reduce time and mental effort required in cognition. A stereotype is a cluster of ideas regarding the characteristics of a specific group. They are category-based schemas about a group of people. For example, a stereotype that Americans are hard-working. If you hear positive things about a group, the social schema about the group would be positive while when you hear negative things about the group, your social schema about the group would be in the form of negative stereotype. The effects of stereotypes are that they give rise to prejudices and biases about specific groups.

"State the factors that influence attitude change. [CBSE (AI) 2011, 2013]","The factors that influence attitude change are as follows: i.  ii.  iii.  Characteristics of the existing attitude: All four properties of attitudes namely, valence (positivity or negativity), extremeness, simplicity or complexity (multiplexity) and centrality determine attitude change. Positive attitudes are easier to change than negative attitudes. Extreme attitudes and central attitudes are more difficult to change than the less extreme and peripheral (less significant) attitudes. Simple attitudes are easier to change than multiple attitudes.Attitude change may be congruent if it changes in the same direction as the existing attitude. For example, a positive attitude may become more positive or a negative attitude may become more negative. An attitude change may be incongruent if it changes in a direction opposite to the existing attitude. For example, a positive attitude may become less positive or negative or a negative attitude may become less negative or positive. Source characteristics: Attitudes are more likely to change when the message comes from a highly credible source than from a low credible source. For example, adults who are planning to buy a laptop are more convinced by a computer engineer advertising the laptop while when the buyers are themselves school children they are more convinced by a school child advertising the laptop. Message characteristics: The message for attitude change contains a rational appeal or an emotional appeal makes a difference. For example, an advertisement for cooking food  iv.  in a pressure cooker may point out that this saves cooking gas (rational appeal) or preserves nutrition (emotional appeal). The motives activated by the message also determine attitude change. For example drinking milk makes a person healthy, goodlooking, more energetic and more successful in one’s job.The mode of spreading the message plays a significant role. Face-to-face transmission of the message is usually more effective than indirect transmission. As for instance, through letters and pamphlets or even through mass media. Target characteristics: People with strong prejudices, people with low self-esteem and low intelligence change their attitudes easily. People with more open and flexible personalities change more easily. Advertisers benefit most from such people.

 Nature of information available to the perceiver. Social schemas in the perceiver (including stereotypes). Personality characteristics of the perceiver. Situational factors
 The process of impression formation is influenced by the above factors which are in turn influenced by Primacy effect Recency effect Halo effect We assign causes to the behavior shown in specific social situations. This process is called attribution. A distinction is made between the attribution that a person makes for his/ her positive and negative experiences (actor-role) than the attribution made by another person’s positive and negative experiences (observer-role). This is called actor-observer effect. When a individual attributes his/her own success, he/she emphasizes on internal factors but for failures to external factors; whereas when he/she attributes success of others he gives emphasis to external factors and for failures to internal factors.

 Abnormal behaviour is explained by the operation of supernatural and magical forces such as evil spirits (bhoot-pret) or the devil (shaitan). Biological or organic approach: Defects in various body and brain processes are linked to many types of maladaptive behaviour. Psychological approach: Psychological problems are caused by inadequacies in the way an individual thinks, feels or perceives the world. Organismic approach: Socrates viewed disturbed behaviour as arising out of conflicts between emotion and reason. Galen elaborated four humours in personal character and temperament. According to him, the material world was made up of four elements, viz. earth, air, fire and water which combined to form four essential body fluids, viz. blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm. Each of these fluids are responsible for a different temperament. Imbalances between these humours were believed to cause various disorders.

Maladaptive: Behaviour is seen as abnormal if it is maladaptive, i.e. if it interferes with optimal functioning and growth.  Behaviour is shaped by societal forces and hence family structure and communication, social networks, societal conditions and societal labels and roles play an important role.

 Q. 9. What are Substance-related and Addictive Disorders? Ans. Addictive behaviour involves excessive intake of high calorie food resulting in extreme obesity or the abuse of substances such as alcohol or cocaine. Substance related and addictive disorders include disorders relating to maladaptive behaviours resulting from regular and consistent use of substance. These disorders include problems associated with the use and abuse of alcohol, cocaine, tobacco and opiods
 which alter the way people think, feel and behave. The most frequently used substances are the following: Alcohol: People who abuse alcohol drink large amounts regularly and rely on it to help them face difficult situations. Eventually, the drinking interferes with their social behaviour and ability to think and work. Their bodies then build up a tolerance for alcohol and they need to drink even greater amounts to feel its effects. They also experience withdrawal responses when they stop drinking. Alcohol destroys millions of families, social relationships and careers. Intoxicated drivers are responsible for many road accidents. It also has serious effects on the children of persons with this disorder. These children have high rates of psychological problems, particularly anxiety, depression, phobias and substance-related disorders. Excessive drinking can seriously damage physical health. Heroin: Heroin intake significantly interferes with social and occupational functioning. Most abusers further develop a dependence on heroin, revolving their lives around the substance, building a tolerance for it, and experiencing a withdrawal reaction when they stop taking it. The most direct danger of heroin abuse is an overdose, which slows down the respiratory centres in the brain, almost paralysing breathing, and in many cases causing death. Cocaine: Regular use of cocaine may lead to a pattern of abuse in which the person may be intoxicated throughout the day and function poorly in social relationships and at work. It may cause problem in short-term memory and attention. Dependence may develop, so that cocaine dominates the person’s life, more of the drug is needed to get the desired effect and stopping it results in feelings of depression, fatigue, sleep problems, irritability and anxiety. It also has dangerous effects on psychological functioning and physical well-being.

Online shopping: Due to easy access and convenience of the Internet, users do shopping at any time of day, thus avoiding hassles of everyday life such as travelling or queues. Health: High levels of internet use are associated with depression, sleep deprivation and loneliness. Those who are addicted to the internet may suffer from great stress when they are disconnected from the internet, and this cycle of stress and relief may lead to altered level of cortisol – a hormone that impacts immune system. Moreover, over-use of internet is associated with more cold and flu symptoms.
 Q. 9. What are Substance-related and Addictive Disorders? Ans. Addictive behaviour involves excessive intake of high calorie food resulting in extreme obesity or the abuse of substances such as alcohol or cocaine. Substance related and addictive disorders include disorders relating to maladaptive behaviours resulting from regular and consistent use of substance. These disorders include problems associated with the use and abuse of alcohol, cocaine, tobacco and opiods
 which alter the way people think, feel and behave. The most frequently used substances are the following: Alcohol: People who abuse alcohol drink large amounts regularly and rely on it to help them face difficult situations. Eventually, the drinking interferes with their social behaviour and ability to think and work. Their bodies then build up a tolerance for alcohol and they need to drink even greater amounts to feel its effects. They also experience withdrawal responses when they stop drinking. Alcohol destroys millions of families, social relationships and careers. Intoxicated drivers are responsible for many road accidents. It also has serious effects on the children of persons with this disorder. These children have high rates of psychological problems, particularly anxiety, depression, phobias and substance-related disorders. Excessive drinking can seriously damage physical health. Heroin: Heroin intake significantly interferes with social and occupational functioning. Most abusers further develop a dependence on heroin, revolving their lives around the substance, building a tolerance for it, and experiencing a withdrawal reaction when they stop taking it. The most direct danger of heroin abuse is an overdose, which slows down the respiratory centres in the brain, almost paralysing breathing, and in many cases causing death. Cocaine: Regular use of cocaine may lead to a pattern of abuse in which the person may be intoxicated throughout the day and function poorly in social relationships and at work. It may cause problem in short-term memory and attention. Dependence may develop, so that cocaine dominates the person’s life, more of the drug is needed to get the desired effect and stopping it results in feelings of depression, fatigue, sleep problems, irritability and anxiety. It also has dangerous effects on psychological functioning and physical well-being.

The mode of spreading the message plays a significant role. Face-to-face transmission of the message is usually more effective than indirect transmission. As for instance, through letters and pamphlets or even through mass media.","Characteristics of the existing attitude: All four properties of attitudes namely, valence (positivity or negativity), extremeness, simplicity or complexity (multiplexity) and centrality determine attitude change. Positive attitudes are easier to change than negative attitudes. Extreme attitudes and central attitudes are more difficult to change than the less extreme and peripheral (less significant) attitudes. Simple attitudes are easier to change than multiple attitudes.Attitude change may be congruent if it changes in the same direction as the existing attitude. For example, a positive attitude may become more positive or a negative attitude may become more negative. An attitude change may be incongruent if it changes in a direction opposite to the existing attitude. For example, a positive attitude may become less positive or negative or a negative attitude may become less negative or positive. Source characteristics: Attitudes are more likely to change when the message comes from a highly credible source than from a low credible source. For example, adults who are planning to buy a laptop are more convinced by a computer engineer advertising the laptop while when the buyers are themselves school children they are more convinced by a school child advertising the laptop.

For example, a person A hit another person B, we may explain the hitting behavior by saying that i. ii.  A hit B because A is short-tempered person or A hit B because B behaved in a nasty way.  There is an overall tendency for people to give greater weightage to internal or dispositional factors than external or situational factors. This is called fundamental attribution error. It varies from culture to culture. A distinction is made between the attribution that a person makes for his/her positive and negative experiences (actor-role) than the attribution made by another person’s positive and negative experiences (observer-role). This is called actor-observer effect.For example, if you get good marks in a test you attribute it to your ability and hard work while if you get bad marks you say that you were unlucky or that the test was difficult. On the other hand, if your class-mate gets good marks you attribute his/her success to good luck or an easy test and if your class-mate gets bad marks you attribute his/her failure to low ability or lack of effort.","There is an overall tendency for people to give greater weightage to internal or dispositional factors than external or situational factors.

What are the characteristics of pro-social behaviour?,The characteristics of pro-social behavior are i. ii. iii. iv.  Aim to benefit or do good to others without expecting anything in return. Helpign others without expecting anything in return. To willingly benefit others without any kind of pressure. Provide help without any difficulty or any cost.  ,"Q. 5. State the factors which influence pro-social behaviour.
 [CBSE (AI) 2012, 2013]
 Ans. The factors influencing pro-social behaviour are: i. ii. iii.
 Pro-social behaviour is expressed when the situation activates certain social norms that require helping others. The norms are: a. Norm of Social Responsibility which states that we should help anyone who needs help. b. Norm of Reciprocity which states one should help those persons who have helped us in the past. c. Norm of Equity which states that we should help others whenever it is fair to do so. For example, it is fair to help a person who has lost all belongingness in a flood than to help a person who has lost everything through gambling. v. People may not help the needy because they feel that the person might feel insulted or may become dependent. vi. Pro-social behaviour is more likely to be shown by individuals who have a high level of empathy. vii. Pro-social behaviour is reduced by factors such as bad mood, being busy with one’s own problems, or feeling that the person to be helped is responsible for his/her situation. viii. Pro-social behaviour is reduced when people are part of a large group. For example, when there is a road accident each person thinks that it is not his/her responsibility alone to give help and that someone else may take the responsibility which is not the case when the person is alone. The people are thus influenced by the phenomenon of the diffusion of responsibility.

Differentiate between adaptation and adjustment.,"We face challenges in our lives. The difficult circumstances, problems and obstacles often block our path leading towards chosen life goals. We change ourselves or adapt according to the demands of the circumstances by means of inbuilt tendencies or through learned behaviours. The term adaptation refers to the process of change in organisms or species to accommodate a particular environment. For example, we put on warm clothes during winter or work hard as per requirement. This enables our survival when we adapt to environmental and social circumstances. Adjustment is to attain a state of equilibrium by fulfilling certain needs. Hungry people, for example, are stimulated by their physiological state to seek food. When they eat, they reduce the stimulating condition and are thereby adjusted to the particular need.

Describe the cognitive theory of stress (primary appraisal and secondary appraisal).,"The perception of stress is dependent upon the individual’s cognitive appraisal which is of two types, primary and secondary. Primary appraisal refers to the perception of a new or changing environment as positive, neutral or negative in its consequences. Negative events are appraised for their possible harm, threat or challenge. Harm is the assessment of the damage that has already been done by the event. Threat is the assessment of the possible future damage that may be brought about by the event. Challenge is associated with expectations of the ability to cope with the stressful event. Secondary appraisal is the assessment of one’s coping abilities and resources and whether they will be sufficient to meet the harm, threat or challenge of the event. ","Q. 2.

According to him GAS involves three stages: i.  ii.  iii.  Alarm reaction: The presence of a stressor leads to activation of the adrenalpituitarycortex system. This triggers the release of hormones producing the stress response. Now the individual is ready for fight or flight. Resistance Stage: Under prolonged stress, the para-sympathetic nervous system calls for more cautious use of the body’s resources in which the organism makes efforts to cope with the threat. Exhaustion stage: Continued exposure to the same stressor or additional stressors drains the body of its resources and leads to the third stage of exhaustion. The physiological systems involved in alarm reaction and resistance become ineffective and susceptibility to stress-related diseases increases.

Describe the effect of stress on the immune system.   ,"Release of stress hormone results in weakening of our immune system thus affecting mental and physical health. Weakened immune system has a serious effect on the individuals’ health. Stress has physiological effects and can affect natural killer cell cytotoxicity, which is of major importance in the defence against various infections and cancer. Reduced levels of natural killer cell cytotoxicity have been found in people who are highly stressed, including students facing important examinations, bereaved persons and those who are severely depressed. Psychological stress is accompanied by negative emotions or burnout situation and associated symptoms such as depression, anxiety, irritability and aggression. Individuals may have panic attacks or show obsessive behaviours, mood swings or phobias. These individuals have feelings of hopelessness which is worsened by injury or disease. Studies reveal that immune functioning is better in individuals receiving social support.

[CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. Type approaches comprehend human personality by examining certain broad patterns in the observed behavioural characteristics of individuals. For example, Type-A personality possess high motivation, lack patience, feel short of time, are in a great hurry and always feel burdened with work. Trait approach focuses on the specific psychological attributes along which individuals tend to differ in consistent and stable ways. For example, an individual with extraversion traits are active, gregarious, impulsive and thrill-seeking. Q. 3. State the characteristics of Type A, Type B, Type C and Type D personality. Ans. Type A personality possess high motivation, lack patience, feel short of time, seem to be in a hurry and feel burdened with work. They are susceptible to problems like hypertension and coronary heart disease. Type B personality are individuals who have absence of Type-A traits. Type C personality are prone to cancer. Individual characterised by this personality are cooperative, unassertive and patient. They suppress their negative emotions such as anger and show compliance to authority. Type D personality are people characterised by proneness to depression. Q. 4. Compare the trait approaches given by Allport and Cattell to understand personality. Ans. Allport proposed that individuals possess a number of traits, which are dynamic in nature. He categorized traits as follows:
 a. Cardinal traits: These indicate the goal around which a person’s entire life seems to revolve. For example, Mahatma Gandhi’s non-violence is identified as Gandhian trait. b. Central traits: These traits like warm, sincere, diligent are often used in writing a job recommendation. c. Secondary traits: These are least generalized characteristics such as ‘likes mangoes’ or ‘prefers ethnic clothes’. Cattell developed a common personality structure on which a person differs. He applied a statistical technique called factor analysis to discover the common structures. He distinguished between source traits and surface traits, source traits are stable andconsidered as building blocks of personality. Surface traits result out of interaction with source traits. He developed a test called 16 PF (16 Personality Factors) for the assessment of personality. Q. 5. Describe the unconscious as described by Sigmund Freud. Ans. According to Freud, the unconscious is a reservoir of instinctive and animal drives. It also stores all ideas and wishes that are concealed from conscious awareness because they lead to psychological conflicts. The sexual desires cannot be expressed openly and are therefore repressed. People constantly struggle to find socially acceptable ways to express these unconscious impulses or to keep those impulses away from being expressed. Unsuccessful resolution of conflicts results in abnormal behaviour. Analysis of forgetting, mispronunciations, jokes and dreams provide us with a means to approach the unconscious. The basic goal of psychoanalytic therapy is to bring the repressed unconscious material into consciousness, thereby helping people to live in a more self-aware and integrated manner. Q. 6. How is fixation different from regression? Ans. Failure of a child to pass successfully through a stage leads to fixation to the stage. For example a child who does not pass successfully through the phallic stage fails to resolve the Oedipus complex and may still feel hostile toward parent of the same sex. He may consider that men are generally hostile and may want to relate to females in a dependable relationship. Regression occurs when a person’s resolution of problems at any stage of development is less than adequate. In this situation, people display behaviours typical of a less mature stage of development. Q. 7. Differentiate between repression and regression. Ans. In Repression anxiety-provoking behaviours or thoughts are totally dismissed by the unconscious. When people repress a feeling or desire, they become totally unaware of that wish or desire. Regression occurs when a person’s resolution of problems at

Describe the unconscious as stated by Freud. Ans. According to Freud, the unconscious is a reservoir of instinctive or animal drives, which also stores all ideas and wishes that are concealed from conscious awareness, perhaps because they lead to psychological conflicts. Most of these arise from sexual desires which cannot be expressed openly and therefore are repressed. People constantly struggle to find either some socially acceptable ways to express unconscious impulses, or to keep those impulses away from being expressed. Unsuccessful resolution of conflicts results in abnormal behaviour. Analysis of forgetting, mispronunciations, jokes and dreams provide us a means to approach the unconscious. Freud developed a therapeutic procedure, called psychoanalysis, whose basic goal is to bring the repressed unconscious materials to consciousness, helping people live in a more self-aware and integrated manner. Q. 11. Describe the structure of personality. Ans. According to Freud, there are three structural elements of personality: i.

For example a child who does not pass successfully through the phallic stage fails to resolve the Oedipus complex and may still feel hostile toward parent of the same sex. He may consider that men are generally hostile and may want to relate to females in a dependable relationship. Regression occurs when a person’s resolution of problems at any stage of development is less than adequate. In this situation, people display behaviours typical of a less mature stage of development.","Diathesis or the presence of some biological aberration which may be inherited. The person may carry a vulnerability to develop a disorder. The person is ‘at risk’ or ‘predisposed’ to develop the disorder. There is a presence of pathogenic stressors that may lead to psychopathology. For example, Aggression refers to behaviour that is intended to cause harm to others. It is demonstrated through harsh words or criticism or hostile feelings against others.

When people repress a feeling or desire, they become totally unaware of that wish or desire. Regression occurs when a person’s resolution of problems at  any stage of development is less than adequate. In this situation, people display behaviours typical of a less mature stage of development.","Repression: In this anxiety-provoking behaviours or thoughts are totally dismissed by the unconscious. For example, when people repress a feeling or desire, they become totally unaware of that wish or desire. Projection: In this people attribute their own traits to others. For e.g. a person who has strong aggressive tendencies may see other people as acting in an excessively aggressive way towards him or her. By means of projection an individual. blames others for his own shortcomings, mistakes, anxiety, guilt, misdeeds. blames others for his own unacceptable impulses, thoughts and desires For example, a student failing in an examination blames the teacher for being unfair or the fate being bad (bad luck). Denial: In this a person totally refuses to accept reality. For example, someone suffering from HIV/AIDS may altogether deny his or her illness. Reaction Formation: In this a person defends against anxiety by adopting behaviours opposite to his or her true feelings. For example, a person with strong sexual urges channels his or her energy into religious fervour. Rationalisation: In this a person tries to make unreasonable feelings or behaviour seem reasonable and acceptable. For example, a person eats the chocolate giving the reason that it will melt in the sun in his pocket. Displacement: A frustrated person may show aggressive behaviour towards a weaker person. For example, members of a majority group in a society may be prejudiced against members of a minority group, and may show aggressive behaviour towards a minority group member, such as using abusive language or physically assaulting the minority group member.

 Q. 19. Differentiate between formal and informal assessment. Ans. Formal assessment is objective, standardized and organized while informal assessment varies from case to case, from one assessor to another and is open to subjective interpretations. Q. 20. Explain any two methods used for psychological assessment. (Write any two) Ans. The methods for psychological assessment are: Self-report Measures: These are fairly structured measures, often based on theory, that require subjects to give verbal responses using some kind of rating scale. The method requires the subject to objectively report her/his own feelings with respect to various items. The responses are accepted at their face value. They are scored in quantitative terms and interpreted on the basis of norms developed for the test. Projective Techniques: Projective techniques were developed to assess unconscious motives and feelings. These techniques are based on the assumption that a less structured or unstructured stimulus or situation will allow the individual to project her/his feelings, desires and needs on to that situation. These projections are interpreted by experts. A variety of projective techniques have been developed; they use various kinds of stimulus materials and situations for assessing personality. Some of them require reporting associations with stimuli (e.g., words, inkblots), some involve story writing around pictures, some require sentence completions, some require expression through drawings. Interview: This involves seeking information from a person on a one-to-one basis. This can be structured or unstructured. For example, an employer selecting employees for his/her organization. Observation: This involves employing systematic, organized and objective procedures to record behavioural phenomenon occurring in a natural situation. This can be participant or non-participant in nature. E.g., observing mother-child interactions. Q. 21. What is naturalistic observation? Ans. Naturalistic observation is observation in a natural setting. For example, observing how people behave in response to a heavy discount provided by a shop. Q. 22. Explain participant observation. Ans. In participant observation, the observer may become part of the group being observed. In this the observer takes some time to establish a rapport with the group so that they start accepting him/her as one of the group members. E.g., a teacher may become a part with students playing in the play-ground.
 Q. 23. Critically evaluate the method of behaviour rating for assessing personality. Ans. Behaviour ratings are used for assessment of personality in educational and industrial settings. In this individuals are put into certain categories in terms of their behavioural qualities. These ratings have drawbacks such as halo effect, middle category bias and extreme response bias. Q. 24. Describe nomination as a method of assessment. Ans. This method is used in obtaining peer assessment. In this each person is asked to choose one or more persons of the group with whom she/he would like to work, study, play or participate in a activity. The person may be asked to specify the reason for his or her choices. Q. 25. What are situational tests? Ans. The most commonly used test of this kind is the situational stress test. It involves a kind of role-playing in which a person performs a task with other persons who are noncooperative and interfering. Thus this test provides us with information about how a person behaves under stressful situations.

Describe the limitations of self-report measures. Explain any two problems associated with their (self-report measures) use for personality assessment. ,The self-report measures suffer from a number of problems: i. ii.  Social desirability: It is a tendency on the part of the respondent to endorse items in a socially desirable manner. Acquiescence: It is a tendency of the subject to agree with items/ questions irrespective of their contents. It often appears in the form of saying ‘yes’ to items. ,"In psychology, a self-report is a test, measure, or survey that relies on the individual’s own report of their symptoms, behaviors, beliefs, or attitudes. Selfreport data is gathered from paper-and-pencil or electronic format, or sometimes through an interview. Self-reports are commonly used in psychological studies largely because much valuable and diagnostic information about a person is revealed to a researcher or a clinician based on a person’s report on himself or herself. One of the most commonlyused self-report tools is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) for personality testing. One of the primary advantages of self-report data is that it can be easily obtained. It is one of the instrumental ways that clinicians diagnose their patients—by asking questions. Those making the self-report are usually familiar with filling outquestionnaires. For research, it is an inexpensive tool that can

 Q. 4. Describe Naturalistic and Participant Observation.
 [CBSE Delhi 2015]
 Ans. Naturalistic Observation is one of the primary ways of learning about the way people behave in a given setting. Suppose, you want to learn how people behave in response to a heavy discount provided by a company while visiting a shopping mall. For this, you could visit the shopping mall where the discounted items are showcased and systematically observe what people do and say before and after the purchases have been made. Participant Observation is a method of naturalistic observation in which the observer is actively involved in the process of observing by becoming an active member of the setting where the observation takes place. For example, an observer may take a part-time job in a shopping mall showroom to become an insider in order to observe variations in the behaviour of customers. Q. 5. Explain three skills of communication.

Proximity: Repeated interactions with the same set of individuals give us a chance to know them and their interests and attitudes. Common interests, attitudes and background are important determinants of your liking for your group members. Similarity: When two people are similar, there is consistency and they start liking each other. For example, when two students in a class share the interest of playing cricket, they are likely to become friends. When we meet similar people, they reinforce and validate our opinions and values and thus we start liking them. For example, you feel watching TV is not good because it shows too much violence and when you meet someone with similar views, it validates your opinion and you start liking the person. Common motives and goals: When people have common motives or goals, they get together and form a group. For example, you want to teach children in a slum area and meet like-minded people who help you in achieving your goal.

Norms provide information to members of a group about what is expected of them in specific situations. People feel uncomfortable if they are considered different from others. Behaving in a way that differs from the expected form of behaviour may lead to disapproval or dislike by others, which is a form of social punishment. Norm is seen as reflecting the views and beliefs of majority. Most people believe that the majority is more likely to be right than wrong.  Example of conformity: a rule is announced in school in banning mobile phones in school. You know that if you do not sign the letter you will lose many friends and get a bad name for keeping student unity. Hence you conform to the group norm by signing the letter, i.e., expectations of other group members so that you are not noticed as deviant.","Norms provide information to members of a group about what is expected of them in specific situations.

 Ans. Release of stress hormone results in weakening of our immune system thus affecting mental and physical health. Weakened immune system has a serious effect on the individuals’ health. Stress has physiological effects and can affect natural killer cell cytotoxicity, which is of major importance in the defence against various infections and cancer. Reduced levels of natural killer cell cytotoxicity have been found in people who are highly stressed, including students facing important examinations, bereaved persons and those who are severely depressed. Psychological stress is accompanied by negative emotions or burnout situation and associated symptoms such as depression, anxiety, irritability and aggression. Individuals may have panic attacks or show obsessive behaviours, mood swings or phobias. These individuals have feelings of hopelessness which is worsened by injury or disease.

Logical-Mathematical: This involves skills in scientific thinking and problem solving. People high on this type of intelligence can think logically and critically. They engage in abstract reasoning and can manipulate symbols to solve mathematical problems. Scientists and Nobel Prize winners are strong in this component. Spatial: It refers to the abilities involved in forming, using and transforming mental images. Pilots, sailors, sculptures, painters, architects, interior decorators andsurgeons are high in this type of intelligence. Musical: It is the capacity to produce, create and manipulate musical patterns. Persons high on this intelligence are sensitive to sounds and vibrations and in creating new patterns of sounds and rhythms. Bodily-Kinaesthetic: This involves using body flexibly and creatively. Athletes, dancers, actors, sportsperson, gymnasts and surgeons are high in this intelligence.

"How is ‘aptitude’ different from ‘interest’ and ‘intelligence’? How is aptitude measured? [CBSE Delhi 2015; (AI) 2011, 2014]","Aptitude is an individual’s capacity to acquire some specific knowledge or skill after training. For example, a person with high mechanical aptitude will be a successfulmechanical engineer. Intelligence is the global and aggregate capacity of an individual to think rationally, act purposefully and deal effectively with the environment. Interest is a preference for a particular activity. For example a person can have a strong interest in mathematics or science. Multiple Aptitude Tests exist in the form of test batteries which measure aptitude in separate areas.

Habitual: The tendency to be overpowered by habits particularly in one’s way of thinking can be detrimental to creative expression. We become so used to thinking in a familiar way that it becomes difficult to think in novel ways. It may be related to quickly jump to conclusions, not to see problems from fresh perspectives, be satisfied with routine patterns of doing things, or resist to overcome pre-conceived viewpoints and not to change immediate judgments. Perceptual: Perceptual blocks prevent us from being open to novel and original ideas. Motivational and emotional: These blocks such as lack of motivation, fear of failure, fear of being different, fear of ridicule or rejection, poor self-concept, negativism etc may hamper creative thinking. Cultural: These barriers are related to excessive adherence to traditions, expectations, conformity pressures and stereotypes.
