What is psycho-neuro-immunology?,"Psycho-neuro-immunology focuses on the links between mind, brain and the immune system. It studies the effects of stress on the immune system.","Q. 8. Describe the effect of stress on the immune system.
 [CBSE Delhi 2015]
 Ans. Release of stress hormone results in weakening of our immune system thus affecting mental and physical health. Weakened immune system has a serious effect on the individuals’ health. Stress has physiological effects and can affect natural killer cell cytotoxicity, which is of major importance in the defence against various infections and cancer. Reduced levels of natural killer cell cytotoxicity have been found in people who are highly stressed, including students facing important examinations, bereaved persons and those who are severely depressed. Psychological stress is accompanied by negative emotions or burnout situation and associated symptoms such as depression, anxiety, irritability and aggression. Individuals may have panic attacks or show obsessive behaviours, mood swings or phobias. These individuals have feelings of hopelessness which is worsened by injury or disease. Studies reveal that immune functioning is better in individuals receiving social support. Emotions such as fear, anger or hostility are associated with anger outbursts, tantrums, withdrawal symptoms and feelings of hopelessness thus leading to weakening of the immune system thus affecting mental and physical health.
 Q. 8. What is psycho-neuro-immunology? Ans. Psycho-neuro-immunology focuses on the links between mind, brain and the immune system. It studies the effects of stress on the immune system. Q. 9. What is fight or flight response? Ans. i. ii.
 "
What is fight or flight response?,"i. ii.  Selye observed that animals exposed to stressors show a similar pattern of bodily response. He called this pattern General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS). The fight or flight response, also called as ‘acute stress response’ refers to a physiological reaction that occurs in the presence of something that is terrifying, either mentally or physically. The response is triggered by the release of hormones that prepare the body to deal with a threat or to run away to safety. The term ‘fight or flight’ represents the choices.

The response is triggered by the release of hormones that prepare the body to deal with a threat or to run away to safety. The term ‘fight or flight’ represents the choices.
 Ans. Nature of Stress: The term ‘stress’ has been originated from the Latin word Strictus, meaning tight or narrow. Stress is described as the pattern of responses an organism makes to stimulus event that disturbs the equilibrium and exceeds a person’s ability to cope. Stressors like noise, crowding, a bad relationship, daily commuting to school or office are events that cause our body to give the stress response. Eustress describes the level of stress that is good and positive and is one of a person’s best assets for achieving peak performance and managing minor crisis. Distress is the manifestation of stress that causes our body’s wear and tear. It produces unpleasant effects, hampers our productivity, emotionally upsets us and causes our performance to deteriorate. Stress is often explained in terms of characteristics of the environment that are disruptive to the individual. Stressors are events that cause our body to give the stress response. Such events include noise, crowding, a bad relationship, or the daily commuting to school or office. The reaction to external stressors is called ‘strain’. OR Lazarus has distinguished between two types of appraisal, i.e. primary and secondary. The perception of stress is dependent upon the individual’s cognitive appraisal which is of two types, primary and secondary. Primary appraisal refers to the perception of a new or changing environment as positive, neutral or negative in its consequences. Negative events are appraised for their possible harm, threat or challenge. Harm is the assessment of the damage that has already been done by the event. Threat is the assessment of the possible future damage that may be brought about by the event. Challenge is associated with expectations of the ability to cope with the stressful event. Secondary appraisal is the assessment of one’s coping abilities and resources and whether they will be sufficient to meet the harm, threat or challenge of the event.
 Selye observed that animals exposed to stressors show a similar pattern of bodily response. He called this pattern General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS). According tohim GAS involves three stages Alarm reaction, Resistance Stage and Exhaustion stage. Coping is a dynamic situation-specific reaction to stress. E.g. watching TV, phone up a friend or try to be with other people. Avoidance-oriented strategy: This involves denying or minimizing the seriousness of the situation. It involves conscious suppression of stressful thoughts and their replacement by self-protective thoughts. Examples of this are watching TV, phone up a friend or try to be with other people. Q. 2.

","relaxation is used to relax the mind and body which starts from the lower part of the body and progresses up to the facial muscles. Meditation Procedures: This technique refocuses the attention that brings about an altered state of consciousness. This is possible through concentration so that the mediator is unaware of any outside stimulation. Biofeedback: This involves three stages: developing an awareness of the particular physiological response, e.g. heart rate, learning ways of controlling that physiological response in quiet conditions; and transferring that control into the conditions of everyday life. Creative Visualisation: This involves imagery and imagination for keeping one’s mind quiet, body relaxed and eyes closed. This reduces the risk of interference from unhidden thoughts and provides the creative energy needed for turning an imagined scene into reality. Cognitive Behavioural Techniques: This approach involves replacing negative and irrational thoughts with positive and rational ones. It includes assessment, stress reduction techniques, and application and follow-through. Assessment involves discussing the nature of the problem and seeing it from the viewpoint of the client. Stress reduction involves learning the techniques of reducing stress such as relaxation and self-instruction. Exercise: Regular exercise improves the efficiency of the heart, enhances the function of the lungs, maintains good circulation, lowers blood pressure, reduces fat in the blood and improves the body’s immune system. Swimming, walking, running, cycling, skipping help to reduce stress.

Explain the concept of prejudice.,"Prejudices are negative attitudes towards a particular group and are based on stereotypes (the cognitive component). The cognitive component of prejudice is accompanied by dislike or hatred (the affective component). Prejudice gets translated into discrimination (the behavioural component) whereby people behave in less positive way towards a particular target group compared to another group which they favour. In our society there has been cases of discrimination due to prejudice based on gender, religion, community, caste, physical handicap and illness such as AIDS.","Learning: Prejudices are learned through association, reward and punishment, observing others, group or cultural norms and exposure to information. Family, reference groups, personal experiences and media play a role in the learning of prejudices. Prejudiced persons show low adjusting capacity, anxiety and feelings of hostility against outgroup. A strong social identity and ingroup bias: Prejudiced individuals who have a strong social identity and have a very positive attitude towards their own group boost this attitude by holding negative attitudes towards other groups. Scapegoating: The majority group places the blame on a majority outgroup for its social, economic and political problems. Scapegoating is a group-based way of expressing frustration and it often results in negative attitudes or prejudices against the weaker group. Kernel of truth concept: People continue to hold stereotypes because they think that after all, there must be some truth or ‘kernel of truth’ in what everyone says about the other group.

What is a prototype? Ans. Schemas that function in the form of categories are called prototypes. They are the entire set of features or qualities that help us to define an object clearly Q. 10. What is primacy effect? Ans. During formation of impression, information presented first has a stronger effect than information presented at the end. This is primacy effect. Q. 11. What is recency effect? Ans. During formation of impression, information that comes at the end may have stronger influence. This is recency effect. Q. 12. What is halo effect? Ans. During formation of impression, we have a tendency to think that a target person who has one set of positive qualities must have other positive qualities. This is known as halo effect. For example, if we are told that a person is ‘tidy’ and ‘punctual’, we are likely to think that the person must also be ‘hardworking’. Q. 13. What is social facilitation? Ans. Improvement in performance in the presence of others is called social facilitation. For example, cyclists racing with each other perform better than when they cycle alone. Q. 14. What is social inhibition? Ans. Decline in performance in the presence of others is called social inhibition. For example, if you recite a poem to an audience, your performance is inhibited than when you recite it to your teacher. Q. 15. Explain pro-social behaviour. Ans. Pro-social behavior or altruism is doing something or thinking about the welfare of others without any self-interest. For example, sharing things, cooperating with others,helping during natural calamities, showing sympathy, doing favours to others.

If others are performing the same task, there is a situation of co-action where there is social comparison and competition and hence performance is better. If individuals are working together in a large group, a phenomenon of social loafing occurs based on the diffusion of responsibility in which there is a reduction of individual effort when working on a collective task.
 Ans. Individuals work less hard in a group than they do when performing alone. This phenomenon is referred to as social loafing. Social loafing is a reduction in individual effort when working on a collective task. This occurs because: i. ii. iii. iv. v.
 Group members feel less responsible for the overall task being performed and therefore exert less effort. Motivation of members decreases because they realize that their contribution will not be evaluated on individual basis. The performance of the group is not compared with other groups. There is improper coordination among members. Belonging to the same group is not important for members.
 For example, students competing in a game of tug-of-war. Similarly, in an experiment, a group of people were asked to clap or cheer as loudly as possible. Results showed that the amount of nose produced by each participant dropped as the size of the group decreased. It is possible to identify how much force each member of the team has been exerting. Such situations give opportunities to group members to relax and become a free rider. The various ways of reducing social loafing: i. ii. iii. iv.

For example, sharing things, cooperating with others,helping during natural calamities, showing sympathy, doing favours to others.  ","Q. 5. State the factors which influence pro-social behaviour.
 [CBSE (AI) 2012, 2013]
 Ans. The factors influencing pro-social behaviour are: i. ii. iii.
 Pro-social behaviour is expressed when the situation activates certain social norms that require helping others. The norms are: a. Norm of Social Responsibility which states that we should help anyone who needs help. b. Norm of Reciprocity which states one should help those persons who have helped us in the past. c. Norm of Equity which states that we should help others whenever it is fair to do so. For example, it is fair to help a person who has lost all belongingness in a flood than to help a person who has lost everything through gambling. v. People may not help the needy because they feel that the person might feel insulted or may become dependent. vi. Pro-social behaviour is more likely to be shown by individuals who have a high level of empathy. vii. Pro-social behaviour is reduced by factors such as bad mood, being busy with one’s own problems, or feeling that the person to be helped is responsible for his/her situation. viii. Pro-social behaviour is reduced when people are part of a large group. For example, when there is a road accident each person thinks that it is not his/her responsibility alone to give help and that someone else may take the responsibility which is not the case when the person is alone. The people are thus influenced by the phenomenon of the diffusion of responsibility.

Biological or organic approach: Defects in various body and brain processes are linked to many types of maladaptive behaviour. Psychological approach: Psychological problems are caused by inadequacies in the way an individual thinks, feels or perceives the world. Organismic approach: Socrates viewed disturbed behaviour as arising out of conflicts between emotion and reason. Galen elaborated four humours in personal character and temperament. According to him, the material world was made up of four elements, viz. earth, air, fire and water which combined to form four essential body fluids, viz. blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm. Each of these fluids are responsible for a different temperament. Imbalances between these humours were believed to cause various disorders. This is similar to the notion of three doshas of vat, pitta and kapha in Aurvedic texts. In the Middle ages demonology, the belief that the people with mental problems were evil and superstition gained importance. During the Renaissance period, psychological conflicts and disturbed interpersonal relationships were the causes of abnormal behaviour. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were known as the age of reason and enlightenment. During this period there was a reform movement during which there was a de-institutioanlisation of the mentally ill and placed emphasis on providing community care for recovered mentally ill individuals.

What is meant by mental disorders? How are they classified? Discuss the role of biological factors in abnormal behaviour. Ans. Mental disorders are abnormal behaviours deviated from some clearly defined norms or standards. Mental disorders have certain common features called 4D’s: deviance, distress, dysfunction and danger.The American Psychiatric Association (APS) classified mental disorders on 5 axes or dimensions popularly known as Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSMIV). World Health Organization (WHO) classified mental disorders by the classification system known as International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10).Biological causes of abnormal behaviour are faulty genes, endocrine imbalances, malnutrition, injuries and other conditions that may interfere with normal development and functioning of the human body.Studies indicate that abnormal activity by certain neuro-transmitters can lead to specific psychological disorders. Anxiety disorders are due to low activity of neuro-transmitter Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), schizophrenia to excess activity of Dopamine and depression to low activity of serotonin.Genetic factors have been linked to mood disorders, schizophrenia, mental disorders etc. Q. 3.

 Q. 6. What are psychological tests and what skills are required by psychologists to use these and where are they used?
 Ans. Psychological tests involve psychological assessment, evaluation and problem solving with individuals and groups, organization, and the community. Psychologists have always been interested in understanding individual differences. Psychological tests have been devised and are primarily used for the determination and analysis of individual differences in general intelligence, differential aptitudes, educational achievement, vocational fitness, personality, social attitudes, and various non- intellectual characteristics. Psychologists study these differences based on factors such as occupation, age, gender, education, culture, etc. While using psychological tests an attitude of objectivity, scientific orientation, and standardized interpretation must be kept in mind. For example, in organizational and personnel work, in business and industry, where specialized tests are used to select individuals for specific jobs, it is essential to use actual performance records or ratings as a criterion for establishing validity of a test.

They focus on the importance of people’s subjective attitudes, feelings and beliefs especially with regard to the self. Human beings are most creative, growing, fully functioning and self-actualising people. Psychologically healthy persons live life to the fullest.Rogers suggest that each person has a concept of ideal self, what a person would like to be. When there is a correspondence between real self and ideal self, a person is generally happy. Discrepancy between real self and ideal self results in unhappiness and dissatisfaction. People have a tendency to maximize self-concept through selfactualisation. When a person has high self-concept, s/he has a high selfesteem and vice-versa. People with high self-esteem are flexible and open to new experiences. An atmosphere of unconditional positive regard must be created in order to ensure enhancement of people’s self-concept. This theory emphasizes the significance of positive aspects of life which may be supported by the following diagram.

For example, an honest person is more likely to remain honest irrespective of time or situation. Q. 12. Describe any two factors from the 5-Factor Model of Personality. (Write any two) Ans. The Big Five Factors include: Openness to experience: Those who score high on this factor are imaginative, curious, open to new ideas, and interested in cultural pursuits. In contrast, those who score low are rigid. Extraversion: It characterizes people who are socially active, assertive, talkative and fun-loving. On its opposite are people who are shy.
 Agreeableness: This factor characterises people who are helpful, co-operative, friendly, caring, and nurturing. On the opposite are people who are hostile and selfcentered. Neuroticism: People who score high on this factor are emotionally unstable, anxious, worried, fearful, distressed, irritable and hypertensive. On the opposite side are people who are well adjusted. Conscientiousness: Those who score high on this factor are achievement-oriented, dependable, responsible, prudent, hardworking and self-controlled. On the opposite are people who are impulsive. Q. 13. Give the characteristics of extroverts. Ans. Extroverts are sociable, outgoing, active, gregarious, impulsive, thrill-seeking, assertive, talkative, fun-loving, drawn to occupations that allow dealing directly with people and react to stress by trying to lose themselves among people and social activity. Q. 14. What are defence mechanisms? Ans. Human behaviour reflects an attempt to deal with or escape from anxiety. Freud described various defence mechanisms which people use to reduce anxiety by distorting reality. Q. 15. Explain the term ‘reaction formation’.

Freud described various defence mechanisms which people use to reduce anxiety by distorting reality.,"Q. 3. What are defence mechanisms? Explain with examples. Ans. According to Freud, defence mechanisms are ways in which the ego unconsciously tries to cope with unacceptable Id desires or impulses. Human behaviour reflects an attempt to deal with or escape from anxiety. Freud described various defence mechanisms which people use to reduce anxiety by distorting reality. Defence mechanisms reduce anxiety temporarily. The optimum use of defence mechanisms is useful, normal and adaptive but excessive use is harmful which can even lead to distortion of reality and develop various forms of maladjustment and psychological problems.

 Q. 19. Differentiate between formal and informal assessment. Ans. Formal assessment is objective, standardized and organized while informal assessment varies from case to case, from one assessor to another and is open to subjective interpretations. Q. 20. Explain any two methods used for psychological assessment. (Write any two) Ans. The methods for psychological assessment are: Self-report Measures: These are fairly structured measures, often based on theory, that require subjects to give verbal responses using some kind of rating scale. The method requires the subject to objectively report her/his own feelings with respect to various items. The responses are accepted at their face value. They are scored in quantitative terms and interpreted on the basis of norms developed for the test. Projective Techniques: Projective techniques were developed to assess unconscious motives and feelings. These techniques are based on the assumption that a less structured or unstructured stimulus or situation will allow the individual to project her/his feelings, desires and needs on to that situation. These projections are interpreted by experts. A variety of projective techniques have been developed; they use various kinds of stimulus materials and situations for assessing personality. Some of them require reporting associations with stimuli (e.g., words, inkblots), some involve story writing around pictures, some require sentence completions, some require expression through drawings. Interview: This involves seeking information from a person on a one-to-one basis. This can be structured or unstructured. For example, an employer selecting employees for his/her organization. Observation: This involves employing systematic, organized and objective procedures to record behavioural phenomenon occurring in a natural situation. This can be participant or non-participant in nature. E.g., observing mother-child interactions. Q. 21. What is naturalistic observation? Ans. Naturalistic observation is observation in a natural setting. For example, observing how people behave in response to a heavy discount provided by a shop. Q. 22. Explain participant observation. Ans. In participant observation, the observer may become part of the group being observed. In this the observer takes some time to establish a rapport with the group so that they start accepting him/her as one of the group members. E.g., a teacher may become a part with students playing in the play-ground.
 Q. 23. Critically evaluate the method of behaviour rating for assessing personality. Ans. Behaviour ratings are used for assessment of personality in educational and industrial settings. In this individuals are put into certain categories in terms of their behavioural qualities. These ratings have drawbacks such as halo effect, middle category bias and extreme response bias. Q. 24. Describe nomination as a method of assessment. Ans. This method is used in obtaining peer assessment. In this each person is asked to choose one or more persons of the group with whom she/he would like to work, study, play or participate in a activity. The person may be asked to specify the reason for his or her choices. Q. 25. What are situational tests? Ans. The most commonly used test of this kind is the situational stress test. It involves a kind of role-playing in which a person performs a task with other persons who are noncooperative and interfering. Thus this test provides us with information about how a person behaves under stressful situations.

 Q. 1. What is the meaning of assessment? Explain the methods used for psychological assessment. [CBSE Delhi 2014; (AI) 2011, 2012, 2014] Ans. Assessment refers to the measurement of psychological attributes of individuals and their evaluation, often using multiple methods in terms of certain standards of comparison. For example, intellectual ability of a slow learner in a class would require testing Intelligence. Formal assessment is objective, standardized and organized while informal assessment varies from case to case and from one assessor to another and is open to subjective interpretations. The methods of assessment are: Psychological test: A psychological test is an objective and standardized measure of an individual’s mental or behavioural characteristics. For example, psychological tests measure psychological attributes such as intelligence, aptitude, personality, etc. Interview: Interview is a face-to-face interaction between two people. For example, an interview between a doctor and a patient, a salesman and a customer, employee selection by an employer. Case-study: A case-study is an in-depth study of an individual in terms of his psychological attributes, psychological history in the context of his physical and psychosocial environment. It is used by Clinical psychologists or a case analysis of great people is an example. Case-studies are based on data generated by different methods such as interview, observation, questionnaire, psychological tests etc. Observation: Observation involves employing systematic, organized and objective procedures to record behavior in a natural situation. For example, observing motherchild interactions. Self-report: Self-report is a method in which a person provides factual information about himself or herself or beliefs and opinions which he or she holds. For example, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. Q. 2. Discuss how interplay of nature and nurture influences intelligence. Distinguish between culture-fair and culture-biased tests.

 [CBSE Delhi 2015]
 Ans. Naturalistic Observation is one of the primary ways of learning about the way people behave in a given setting. Suppose, you want to learn how people behave in response to a heavy discount provided by a company while visiting a shopping mall. For this, you could visit the shopping mall where the discounted items are showcased and systematically observe what people do and say before and after the purchases have been made. Participant Observation is a method of naturalistic observation in which the observer is actively involved in the process of observing by becoming an active member of the setting where the observation takes place. For example, an observer may take a part-time job in a shopping mall showroom to become an insider in order to observe variations in the behaviour of customers. Q. 5.

It can be performed relatively quickly so a researcher can obtain results in days or weeks rather than observing a population over the course of longer time frames. The self-reports can be made in private and can be anonymized to protect sensitive information and perhaps promote truthful responses. Collecting information through a self-report, however, has its limitations As people are often biased when they report on their own experiences. For example, many individuals are either consciously or unconsciously influenced by ‘social desirability,’ that is, they are more likely to report experiences that are considered to be socially acceptable or preferred. This ‘multi-modal’ or ‘multi-method’ assessment provides a more global and therefore likely more accurate picture of the subject.

Psychological tests involve psychological assessment, evaluation and problem solving with individuals and groups, organization, and the community. Psychologists have always been interested in understanding individual differences. Psychological tests have been devised and are primarily used for the determination and analysis of individual differences in general intelligence, differential aptitudes, educational achievement, vocational fitness, personality, social attitudes, and various non- intellectual characteristics. Psychologists study these differences based on factors such as occupation, age, gender, education, culture, etc. While using psychological tests an attitude of objectivity, scientific orientation, and standardized interpretation must be kept in mind. For example, in organizational and personnel work, in business and industry, where specialized tests are used to select individuals for specific jobs, it is essential to use actual performance records or ratings as a criterion for establishing validity of a test.

Explain ‘encoding’ in the communication process. [CBSE Delhi 2011; (AI) 2012],"Encoding in the communication process involves taking ideas, giving them meaning and putting them in message forms. For example, while taking an examination you realize that you have not brought your pen and you ask your friend for it, i.e., encode a message that you need a pen.","Encoding: Encoding in the communication process involves taking ideas, giving them meaning and putting them in message forms. For example, while taking an examination you realize that you have not brought your pen and you ask your friend for it, i.e., encode a message that you need a pen. Channel: After the message is encoded it is passed through a channel and our senses such as eyes, ears, tongue, nose or skin become active. Decoding: After the message is encoded, passed through a channel it is decoded wherein the message is translated into understandable forms. For example, you may say that you heard a bell or an object feels soft. Speaking: This involves the use of language which the communicator should use appropriately. Listening: Academic success, employment achievement and personal happiness depend upon your ability to listen effectively. Listening requires a person to be attentive. S/he should be patient, non-judgmental and yet have the capacity to analyze and respond. Reception: During reception, in addition to using the hearing mechanism, people listen through their visual system. They observe a person’s facial expressions, posture, movement and appearance. Attention: Normally your attention is divided between what you are attempting to listen to, and what is happening around you, and what is going on in your mind. For example, while watching a movie, a person in front of you is constantly whispering to his friend or you are worried about your forthcoming examination. Thus, your attention is divided and is pulled in different directions. Paraphrasing: Paraphrasing involves the ability of a counsellor to reflect on what the client says and feels using different words. Human communication becomes effective if the counsellor understands and is again able to relate in his words what feelings and emotions the client has described.

Explain non-verbal communication. Ans. It is possible to communicate effectively even without using verbal language: The language that people exchange without using words is called body language Use of gesture, posture, eye contact, clothing style, body movement and facial expressions are some examples of body language.

For example, crossing arms over the chest may suggest that a person likes to keep aloof. But, crossed arms accompanied by an erect posture, tightened body muscles, a set clenched jaw and a narrowing of the eyes are likely to communicate anger.

Explain the term crowding. 2016]    [CBSE (AI) ,"Crowding is the person’s reaction to the presence of a large number of persons within a particular area or apace. When this number goes beyond a certain level, it becomes an environmental stressor and causes stress to individuals in that situation. The experience of crowding causes a feeling of discomfort, loss or decrease in privacy, negative view of the space around the person and feeling of loss of control over social interaction. For example, 15 people squeezing on 4 seats in a railway compartment experience crowding but the same 15 people in a marriage party do not experience crowding.","Ans.

Q. 10. What is crowding tolerance?
 A social unit consisting of two or more individuals. A collection of individuals who have common motives or goals. A collection of individuals who are interdependent. For example, fielders in a cricket team drop a catch – this will have a consequence for the entire team. A collection of individuals who satisfy each other’s’ needs. A gathering of individuals who interact with one another. The interactions in a group are structured by a set of roles and norms. That is, the group performs the same functions every time it meets and the group members adhere to the group norms.
 Q. 2. Differentiate between crowd and teams. Ans. A crowd is a collection of people who are present in a place or situation by chance. There is neither any structure nor any feeling of belongingness in a crowd. The behaviour of people in crowds is irrational and hence there is no interdependence among the members. For example, a large number of people collected around an accident on a road. Teams are special kind of groups who have a common goal or purpose as in a cricket team. Both individual contribution and team work matter. Although there is a leader, the members hold themselves responsible. Q. 3. Differentiate between an audience and a mob. Ans. An audience is a collection of people who have assembled for a special purpose. For example, to watch a cricket match or a movie. They are generally passive but sometimes become frenzy and become mobs. A mob has a definite purpose. There is polarization in attention and actions of persons in a common direction. Mob behaviour is characterised by homogeneity of thought and behaviour as well as impulsivity. Q. 4. Describe the elements of group structure.

What are the causes of aggression? Ans. The following are the causes of aggression: i. ii. iii.
 iv.
 Inborn tendency: Aggression is an inborn tendency which may be meant for selfdefense. Physiological mechanisms: A general physiological state of arousal or feeling activated might be expressed in the form of aggression. Child-rearing: Children whose parents use physical punishment may become angry and show resentment and hence more aggressive than children whose parents use other disciplinary techniques. Frustration: People in frustrated situations show more aggression than those who are not frustrated. In an experiment children are frustrated by preventing them from getting attractive toys that are visible through a screen. These children
 Learning: Individuals exhibit aggression when such behavior is rewarded. For example, hostile aggression allows aggressive person to get what she wants. Also, aggression is learned through reinforcement or by observing others. Observing an aggressive model: Observing a model especially on television may make a person aggressive. Anger-provoking action by others: A person who is made to feel angry through insults or threats, physical aggression or dishonesty is likely to show aggression than who is not made to feel angry. Availability of weapons: Aggression is more likely if weapons such as stick, pistol or knife are easily available. Personality factors: People with low self-esteem and those who feel insecure are more likely to show aggression. Cultural factors: Individuals are more aggressive in cultures where aggressive behaviour is encouraged and praised rather than discouraged or criticised.
 Q. 4. Differentiate between instrumental aggression and hostile aggression. [CBSE Delhi 2011] Ans. Instrumental aggression is an act of aggression meant to obtain a certain goal or object. For example a bully slaps a new student in school to snatch his chocolate. Hostile aggression is expression of anger causing harm but not to obtain anything from
 the victim. For example, a criminal may beat up a person in the community for mentioning his name to the police. Q. 5. State the strategies for reducing aggression and violence. [CBSE Delhi 2015; (AI) 2011, 2015] Ans. The following are the various ways of reducing aggression and violence: i. ii. iii. iv.
 Parents and teachers should not encourage or reward aggression in any form. Opportunities to observe or imitate aggressive models should be reduced drastically. Imparting social justice and equality in society may help in reducing frustration and hence frustration. A positive attitude towards peace should be inculcated.

What is poverty?,"Poverty is a condition in which there is a lack of necessities of life such as food, clothing and shelter in the context of unequal distribution of wealth in society.","Ans. Aggression refers to behaviour that is intended to cause harm to others. It is demonstrated through harsh words or criticism or hostile feelings against others. For example, a bully slaps a new student in school to snatch his chocolate. Q. 14. What is poverty? Ans. Poverty is a condition in which there is a lack of necessities of life such as food, clothing and shelter in the context of unequal distribution of wealth in society. Q. 15. Differentiate between poverty and deprivation. Ans. Poverty refers to an actual shortage of resources necessary for living. Deprivation is a state of perceiving or thinking that one has got less than what one should have got. The situation of the poor is worsened if they also experience deprivation, in reality usually the poor also feel deprived. Q. 16. What is discrimination? Ans. Discrimination refers to behaviour due to prejudice, which makes a distinction between rich and the poor, favouring the rich and advantaged over the poor and the disadvantaged. Distinction is seen in matters of interaction, education and employment. Q. 17. State the frustration-aggression theory. Ans. People in frustrated situations show more aggression than those who are not frustrated. In an experiment children are frustrated by preventing them from getting attractive toys that are visible through a screen. These children are found to be more destructive than those children who are allowed to access the toys. Q. 18. What is Citizenship? Ans. A citizen is a participatory member of a political community. Citizenship is gained by meeting legal requirements of national, state or local government. A nation grants certain rights and privileges to its citizens. In return, citizens are expected to obey their country’s laws and defend it against its enemies. It thus involves active involvement in various social, political and cultural activities.
 The poor have low aspirations and low achievement motivation and high need for dependence. They explain their successes in terms of luck or fate rather than anxiety or hard work. The poor and deprived have low self-esteem, are high on anxiety and introversion, dwell on the immediate present rather than the future. They prefer smaller immediate rewards rather than larger ones. They live with a sense of hopelessness, powerlessness, feel injustice and experience a loss of identity. The poor and deprived exhibit an attitude of resentment towards the rest of the society.
 iv. v.
 Intellectual functioning and performance on cognitive tasks is low. The poor are more likely to suffer from mental illness due to constant worries about basic necessities, feelings of insecurity and inability to get medical facilities. The poor suffer from emotional and adjustment problems due to their experience of a sense of hopelessness and loss of identity as though they do not belong to society.

Family, reference groups, personal experiences and media play a role in the learning of prejudices. Prejudiced persons show low adjusting capacity, anxiety and feelings of hostility against outgroup. A strong social identity and ingroup bias: Prejudiced individuals who have a strong social identity and have a very positive attitude towards their own group boost this attitude by holding negative attitudes towards other groups. Scapegoating: The majority group places the blame on a majority outgroup for its social, economic and political problems. Scapegoating is a group-based way of expressing frustration and it often results in negative attitudes or prejudices against the weaker group. Kernel of truth concept: People continue to hold stereotypes because they think that after all, there must be some truth or ‘kernel of truth’ in what everyone says about the other group.

For this, you could visit the shopping mall where the discounted items are showcased and systematically observe what people do and say before and after the purchases have been made. Participant Observation is a method of naturalistic observation in which the observer is actively involved in the process of observing by becoming an active member of the setting where the observation takes place. For example, an observer may take a part-time job in a shopping mall showroom to become an insider in order to observe variations in the behaviour of customers. Q. 5.

When compliance is shown to an instruction or order from a person in authority such as parents, teachers, leaders or policemen, that is called obedience. The causes of obedience are: i. ii. iii. iv.
 People obey because they feel that they are not responsible for their own actions, they are simply carrying out orders from the authority. Authority possesses symbols of status (e.g., uniform, title) which people find difficult to resist. Once you obey small orders, slowly there is an escalation of commitment for the person who is in authority and one starts obeying bigger orders. Many times, events are moving at such a fast speed, that no one has time to think but just to obey orders from above.

What is existential anxiety?
 Q. 2. How is behaviour therapy used to treat phobia? Or Enumerate the steps in systematic desensitization. Ans. Systematic desensitization is a technique used in behaviour therapy introduced by Wolpe for treating phobias or irrational fears. The therapist prepares a hierarchy of anxiety-provoking stimuli with the least anxiety-provoking stimuli at the bottom of the hierarchy. The therapist relaxes the client and asks the client to think of the least anxiety-provoking situation. The client is asked to stop thinking of the fearful situation if the slightest tension is felt. Over sessions the client is able to imagine more severe fear provoking situations while maintaining the relaxation. The client gets systematically desensitized to the fear. The process of systematic desensitization is based on the principle of reciprocal inhibition which states that two mutually opposing forces inhibits the weaker force. Q. 3. Describe Rational Emotive Therapy. Ans. Psychological distress is caused by irrational thoughts and beliefs. The distorted perception of the antecedent event due to irrational beliefs leads to a consequence, i.e., negative emotions and behaviours. In the process of RET, the irrational beliefs are refuted by the therapist through the process of non-directive questioning. The nature of questioning is gentle, without probing or being directive. Q. 4. Discuss Cognitive therapy given by Albert Ellis. Ans. Albert Ellis formulated the Rational Emotive Therapy (RET) in which he states that the distorted perception of the antecedent event due to the irrational belief leads to a consequence, i.e., negative emotions and behaviours. Irrational beliefs are assessed through questionnaires and interviews and are refuted by the therapist through nondirective questioning. The nature of questioning is gentle without probing or being directive. The questions make the client to think deeper into his/her assumptions about life and problems. Gradually the client is able to change
 the irrational beliefs by making a change in his/her philosophy about life. The rational belief system replaces the irrational belief system and there is reduction in psychological distress. Q. 5. Discuss cognitive therapy given by Aaron Beck. OR How is Rational Emotive Therapy (RET) used in treating psychological disorders? [CBSE (AI) 2011] OR Explain with examples that how cognitive distortions take place. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Aaron Beck states that childhood experiences provided by family and society develop core schemas or systems. For example, a client, who was neglected by the parents as a child, develops the core schema ‘I am not wanted’. During the course of life, a critical incident occurs in his/her life. S/he is publicly ridiculed by the teacher in school. The critical incident triggers the core schema of ‘I am not wanted’ leading to the development of negative automatic thoughts. These negative thoughts lead to cognitive distortions such as ‘I am ugly’, ‘I am stupid’, ‘Nobody loves me’ which are called dysfunctional cognitive structures. Repeated occurrence of these thoughts leads to development of feelings of anxiety and depression. The therapist uses gentle, nonthreatening questioning by which the client thinks in the direction opposite to negative automatic thoughts and gains insight of his dysfunctional schemas and achieves cognitive restructuring which reduces anxiety and depression. Q. 6. Mention the therapy that encourages the client to seek personal growth and actualise their potential. Give its salient features. The humanistic-existential therapies encourage personal growth and actualise the potential by expanding the client’s awareness. The therapist is merely facilitator and guide. It is the client who is responsible for the success of the therapy by the process of self-growth through which healing takes place. The therapy creates a permissive, non-judgmental and accepting atmosphere in which the client’s emotions can be freely expressed and the complexity, balance and integration could be achieved. The fundamental assumption is that the client has the freedom and responsibility to control his/her own behaviour. Q. 7. What is the meaning of ‘Logotherapy’?

 in which the client arrives at the solutions through the process of personal growth. Thus the client understands oneself and one’s aspirations, emotions and motives. The principles underlying humanistic existential psychotherapy are i. ii.
 iii.
 Psychological distress arises from feelings of loneliness, alienation and inability to find meaning and genuine fulfillment in life. Human beings are motivated by the desire for personal growth and selfactualisation, and an innate need to grow emotionally. When these needs are curbed by society and family, human beings experience psychological distress. Frustration of self actualisation also causes distress. The humanistic-existential therapies encourage personal growth and actualise the potential. Self actualisation requires free emotional expression. The family and society curb emotional expression which leads to destructive behaviour and negative emotions by thwarting the process of emotional expression. The therapist is merely facilitator and guide. It is the client who is responsible for the success of the therapy by the process of self-growth through which healing takes place.

 Ans. Maslow gave a detailed account of psychologically healthy people in reference to attainment of self-actualisation. Self-actualisation is a state in which people have reached their fullest potential and develop a complex, balanced and integrated personality. Q. 13. What is occupational therapy?
 Ans. Alfred Adler is known as individual psychology in which he assumes that human behaviour is purposeful and goal-directed. Our personal goals are the sources of our motivation. In Adler’s view every individual suffers from the feelings of inadequacy and guilt i.e., inferiority complex which arise from childhood. Overcoming this complex is essential for optimal personality development.
 Q. 15. Discuss Erich Fromm’s theory of personality Ans. Erich Fromm viewed human beings as social beings who could be understood in terms of the relationship with others. He argued that psychological qualities such as growth and realization of potentials resulted from desire for freedom and striving for justice and truth. Q. 16. Discuss Erikson’s concept of identity crisis. [CBSE Delhi 2016; (AI) 2016] Ans. Erik Erikson laid stress on rational, conscious ego processes in personality development. He viewed development as a life-ling process with a central place granted to ego identity. His concept of identity crisis of adolescent age has shown considerable attention. The primary task of adolescence is to establish an identity separate from their parents. In this process, the adolescents experience conflict with their parents and with themselves. Those who are not able to cope with this identity crisis are confused. This ‘identity confusion’, according to Erikson, can lead them to isolate themselves from their peers and family, or they lose their identity in the crowd. Adolescents on one hand may desire independence and at the same time show a great deal of dependence on their parents. Rapid fluctuations of self-confidence and insecurity are typical of this stage. Q. 17. Describe the behavioural approach to the study of personality. [CBSE Delhi 2016; (AI) 2013] Ans. Behaviourists believe in data which are definable, observable, measurable and scientifically verifiable. They focus on learning of stimulus-response connections and their reinforcement. Personality is not biologically determined and is learned through classical conditioning, operant conditioning and modelling. The principles of theories of classical conditioning (Pavlov), instrumental conditioning (Skinner) and observational learning (Bandura) have been widely used in developing personality theories. A response is the structural unit of behaviour. If a particular response is positively reinforced, then it is repeated again and again and becomes a part of habit. Personality is basically a bundle of habits. For example, initially children eat vegetables such as spinach, pumpkin and gourds because of appreciation or reinforcement from their parents, but later they develop the taste of these vegetables. Q. 18. Describe the cultural approach to the study of personality. Ans. This approach attempts to understand personality in relation to the features of ecological and cultural environment. In agricultural societies, children are socialized to be obedient to elders, nurturant to youngsters and responsible to their duties. In contrast hunting-gathering societies show independence, autonomy and are achievement-oriented.
 Q. 19. Describe the humanistic approach to personality. [CBSE (AI) 2012, 2013, 2016] Ans. Humanistic approach to personality was proposed by Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow, emphasise personal responsibility and innovate tendencies towards personal growth. They focus on the importance of people’s subjective attitudes, feelings and beliefs, especially with regard to the self. Human beings are most creative, growing, fully functioning and self-actualising people, fulfillment is the motivating force for personality development. Psychologically healthy persons live life to the fullest. Two assumptions by Rogers are that Behaviour is goal directed or worthwhile People choose adaptive and self-actualising behaviour Humanistic theories emphasise personal responsibility and innovate tendencies toward personal growth. They focus on the importance of people’s subjective attitudes, feelings and beliefs especially with regard to the self. Human beings are most creative, growing, fully functioning and self-actualising people. Psychologically healthy persons live life to the fullest.Rogers suggest that each person has a concept of ideal self, what a person would like to be. When there is a correspondence between real self and ideal self, a person is generally happy. Discrepancy between real self and ideal self results in unhappiness and dissatisfaction. People have a tendency to maximize self-concept through selfactualisation. When a person has high self-concept, s/he has a high selfesteem and vice-versa. People with high self-esteem are flexible and open to new experiences. An atmosphere of unconditional positive regard must be created in order to ensure enhancement of people’s self-concept. This theory emphasizes the significance of positive aspects of life which may be supported by the following diagram.
