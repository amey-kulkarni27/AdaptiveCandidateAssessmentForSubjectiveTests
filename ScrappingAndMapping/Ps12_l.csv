Explain the components of communication process. 2013]  [CBSE Delhi 2014; (AI) ,"The various components of the communication process are: i.  ii. iii.  iv. v.  vi.  vii.  viii.  Encoding: Encoding in the communication process involves taking ideas, giving them meaning and putting them in message forms. For example, while taking an examination you realize that you have not brought your pen and you ask your friend for it, i.e., encode a message that you need a pen. Channel: After the message is encoded it is passed through a channel and our senses such as eyes, ears, tongue, nose or skin become active. Decoding: After the message is encoded, passed through a channel it is decoded wherein the message is translated into understandable forms. For example, you may say that you heard a bell or an object feels soft. Speaking: This involves the use of language which the communicator should use appropriately. Listening: Academic success, employment achievement and personal happiness depend upon your ability to listen effectively. Listening requires a person to be attentive. S/he should be patient, non-judgmental and yet have the capacity to analyze and respond. Reception: During reception, in addition to using the hearing mechanism, people listen through their visual system. They observe a person’s facial expressions, posture, movement and appearance. Attention: Normally your attention is divided between what you are attempting to listen to, and what is happening around you, and what is going on in your mind. For example, while watching a movie, a person in front of you is constantly whispering to his friend or you are worried about your forthcoming examination. Thus, your attention is divided and is pulled in different directions. Paraphrasing: Paraphrasing involves the ability of a counsellor to reflect on what the client says and feels using different words. Human communication becomes effective if the counsellor understands and is again able to relate in his words what feelings and emotions the client has described.

Describe the historical background behind abnormal behaviour.,"The various approaches to the causes of abnormal behaviour are: i. ii. iii. iv.  v. vi. vii.  Abnormal behaviour is explained by the operation of supernatural and magical forces such as evil spirits (bhoot-pret) or the devil (shaitan). Biological or organic approach: Defects in various body and brain processes are linked to many types of maladaptive behaviour. Psychological approach: Psychological problems are caused by inadequacies in the way an individual thinks, feels or perceives the world. Organismic approach: Socrates viewed disturbed behaviour as arising out of conflicts between emotion and reason. Galen elaborated four humours in personal character and temperament. According to him, the material world was made up of four elements, viz. earth, air, fire and water which combined to form four essential body fluids, viz. blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm. Each of these fluids are responsible for a different temperament. Imbalances between these humours were believed to cause various disorders. This is similar to the notion of three doshas of vat, pitta and kapha in Aurvedic texts. In the Middle ages demonology, the belief that the people with mental problems were evil and superstition gained importance. During the Renaissance period, psychological conflicts and disturbed interpersonal relationships were the causes of abnormal behaviour. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were known as the age of reason and enlightenment. During this period there was a reform movement during which there was a de-institutioanlisation of the mentally ill and placed emphasis on providing community care for recovered mentally ill individuals.

 Q. 2. Describe the psychological models to explain abnormal behaviour/mental disorders. [CBSE Delhi 2014; (AI) 2014] Ans. Psychological and interpersonal factors have a significant role to play in abnormal behaviour. These factors include maternal deprivation (separation from the mother, or lack of warmth and stimulation during early years of life, faulty parent-child relationship (rejection, over-protection, over-permissiveness, faulty discipline etc.), maladaptive family structures (inadequate family structures) and severe stress. The following are the psychological models to explain abnormal behaviour: Psychological models provide a psychological explanation of mental disorders.

The psychological models include psychodynamic, behavioural, cognitive and humanistic-existential models. i.  ii.  iii.  iv.  Psychodynamic model: Psychodynamic theorists believe that behaviour is determined by psychological forces of which the individual is not consciously aware. This model was first formulated by Freud who believed that three forces shape personality – instinctual needs, drives and impulses (id), rational thinking (ego) and moral standards (superego). They believe that abnormal behaviour is due to unconscious mental conflicts that can be traced to early childhood period. Behavioural model: According to this model maladaptive ways of behaving is learned through classical conditioning (temporal association in which two events repeatedly occur close together in time), operant conditioning (behaviour is followed by a reward), social learning (learning by imitating others’ behaviour). Cognitive model: People may hold assumptions and attitudes about themselves that are irrational and inaccurate. People may also repeatedly think in illogical ways and make over-generalisations and draw negative conclusions on the basis of a single insignificant event. Humanistic-existential model: Humanists believe that human beings are born with a natural tendency to be friendly, cooperative and constructive and are driven to self-actualise, i.e., to fulfill this potential for goodness and growth. They further believe that from birth we have total freedom to give meaning to our existence or avoid that responsibility. Those who shrink from this responsibility live empty, inauthentic and dysfunctional lives. ","Q. 2. Describe the psychological models to explain abnormal behaviour/mental disorders.

The person may carry a vulnerability to develop a disorder. The person is ‘at risk’ or ‘predisposed’ to develop the disorder. This is observed in a general physiological state of arousal or feeling activated which might be expressed in the form of aggression. Personality factors such as people with low self-esteem and those who feel insecure are more likely to show aggression. There is a presence of pathogenic stressors that may lead to psychopathology. This is observed in people who in frustrated situations show more aggression than those who are not frustrated. In an experiment children are frustrated by preventing them from getting attractive toys that are visible through a screen. These children are found to be more destructive than those children who are allowed to access the toys. ","Q. 3.

They may knock things over and sometimes more serious accidents and injuries occur. Hyperactive children fidget, squirm, climb and run around the room aimlessly. Autism Spectrum Disorders– These disorders are characterized by severe impairments in social interaction and communication skills, and stereotyped patterns of behaviours, interests and activities. These children have marked difficulties in social interaction and communication; and strong desire for routine. About 70% of children with autism are also mentally retarded.Children with this disorder experience profound difficulties in relating to other people. They are unable to initiate social behaviour and are unresponsive to other people’s feelings. They are unable to share experiences or emotions with others. They show serious abnormalities in communication and language. Many of them never develop speech and those who do have repetitive and deviant speech patterns. These children show narrow patterns of interest and repetive behaviours such as lining up objects or stereotyped body movements such as rocking hand flapping or banging their head against the wall. Intellectual disability– This refers to below average intellectual functioning with IQ 70 or below and deficits or impairments in adaptive behaviour which include areas of communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, functional academic skills, work and which are manifested below the age of 18 years. Specific learning disorder– In this, the individual experiences difficulty in perceiving or processing information efficiently and accurately. These get manifested in during early school years and the individual encounters problems in basic skills in reading, writing and/or mathematics. The affected child tends to perform below average for his/her age. However, individuals may be able to reach acceptable performance levels with additional inputs and efforts. Specific learning disorder is likely to impair functioning and performance in activities/occupations dependent on the related skills.

What are Substance-related and Addictive Disorders?,"Addictive behaviour involves excessive intake of high calorie food resulting in extreme obesity or the abuse of substances such as alcohol or cocaine. Substance related and addictive disorders include disorders relating to maladaptive behaviours resulting from regular and consistent use of substance. These disorders include problems associated with the use and abuse of alcohol, cocaine, tobacco and opiods  which alter the way people think, feel and behave. The most frequently used substances are the following: Alcohol: People who abuse alcohol drink large amounts regularly and rely on it to help them face difficult situations. Eventually, the drinking interferes with their social behaviour and ability to think and work. Their bodies then build up a tolerance for alcohol and they need to drink even greater amounts to feel its effects. They also experience withdrawal responses when they stop drinking. Alcohol destroys millions of families, social relationships and careers. Intoxicated drivers are responsible for many road accidents. It also has serious effects on the children of persons with this disorder. These children have high rates of psychological problems, particularly anxiety, depression, phobias and substance-related disorders. Excessive drinking can seriously damage physical health. Heroin: Heroin intake significantly interferes with social and occupational functioning. Most abusers further develop a dependence on heroin, revolving their lives around the substance, building a tolerance for it, and experiencing a withdrawal reaction when they stop taking it. The most direct danger of heroin abuse is an overdose, which slows down the respiratory centres in the brain, almost paralysing breathing, and in many cases causing death. Cocaine: Regular use of cocaine may lead to a pattern of abuse in which the person may be intoxicated throughout the day and function poorly in social relationships and at work. It may cause problem in short-term memory and attention. Dependence may develop, so that cocaine dominates the person’s life, more of the drug is needed to get the desired effect and stopping it results in feelings of depression, fatigue, sleep problems, irritability and anxiety. It also has dangerous effects on psychological functioning and physical well-being.  ","Q. 10. What are Substance-use Disorders? Illustrate the two categories of substance use disorders. [CBSE Delhi 2014; (AI) 2014] OR Differentiate between substance dependence and substance abuse. [CBSE AI 2012] Ans. Substance-use disorders include problems associated with using and abusing drugs such as alcohol, cocaine and heroin. In substance dependence, the person addicted shows withdrawal symptoms and compulsive drug-taking. In substance abuse, the person addicted damage their family and social relationships, perform poorly at work and create physical hazards. The following are the two types of substance use disorders: Substance dependence: Intense craving for the substance addicted to. Individuals show tolerance, withdrawal symptoms and compulsive drug taking. The substance can change mood, thinking processes and consciousness. Substance abuse: Recurrent and significant consequences of use of substances. Damage to family, social relationship, poor work performance and physical hazards. Alcohol, cocaine, heroin are common substances abused. Q. 11. What do you understand by internet addiction?

What is social facilitation? Explain.,"i.  ii.  iii.  iv.  v. vi.  Social facilitation can be defined as ‘an improvement in performance produced by the mere presence of others’. There are two types of social facilitation: (a) co-action effects (b) audience effect. Studies and research on social facilitation concern the extent to which a given piece of an individual’s behavior is affected by the real, imagined or implied presence of others. Perhaps the first social psychology laboratory experiment was undertaken in this area by Norman Triplett in 1898.In his research on the speed records of cyclists, he noticed that racing against each other rather than against the clock alone increased the cyclists’ speeds. He attempted to duplicate this under laboratory conditions using children and fishing reels. There were two conditions: the child alone and children in pairs but working alone. Their task was to wind in a given amount of fishing line and Triplett reports that many children worked faster in the presence of a partner doing the same task. Triplett’s experiments exhibit the co-action effect, a phenomenon whereby increased task performance comes about by the mere presence of others doing the same task. The coaction effect may come into operation if you find that you work well in a library in preference to working at home where it is equally quiet. Social facilitation occurs not only in the presence of a co-actor but also in the presence of a passive spectator/audience. This is known as the audience effect, surprisingly. We can say that the extent of social facilitation or inhibition depends upon the nature of the interaction between the task and the performer. According to Cottrell (1968), it’s not the presence of other people that is important for social facilitation to occur but the apprehension about being evaluated by them.

"State the factors that lead to the formation of attitudes. Explain the process of attitude change giving examples from everyday life. [CBSE (AI) 2015] State the factors that influence attitude formation.  [CBSE (AI) 2011, 2014] ","The factors influencing attitude formation are as follows: i.  Family and School Environment: Learning of attitudes within the family and school usually takes place by association, through reward and punishment and through modeling.  ii.  iii.  iv.  Reference Groups: Attitudes towards various topics such as political, religions and social groups, occupations, national and other issues is developed through reference groups. This is learning by reward and punishment. Personal Experiences: Personal experience can bring a drastic change in our attitude. Here is a real-life example. A driver in the army went through a personal experience that transformed his life. On one mission, he narrowly escaped death although all his companions got killed. He gave up his job in the army and worked actively as a community leader. Through a purely personal experience the individual evolved a strong positive attitude towards community upliftment. Media-related Influences: Media can exert both good and bad influences on attitudes. On one hand, the media and internet make people better informed than other modes of communication while on the other hand it can create negative attitudes in people.  Attitude Change (Write any one out of the following three): In the process of attitude change, the concept of balance proposed by Fritz Heider is described in the form of P-O-X triangle. Attitude changes if there is a state of imbalance between P-O attitude and O-X attitude and P-X attitude. For example, in the study of attitude towards dowry(X), a person (P) has a positive attitude towards dowry (P-X positive). P is planning to get his son married to the daughter of some person (O) who has a negative attitude towards dowry (O-X negative). Here P-X is positive, O-P is positive but O-X is negative. That is, there are 2 positives and 1 negative in the triangle. This is a situation of imbalance. Imbalance on POX triangle is found when i. ii.  All the 3 sides of the POX triangle are negative or 2 sides are positive and 1 side negative.  Balance is found when i. ii.  All the 3 sides are positive or 2 sides are negative and 1 side is positive.  In the process of attitude change the concept of cognitive dissonance was proposed by Leon Festinger. If an individual finds that two cognitions in an attitude are dissonant, then one of them will be changed in the direction of consonance. For example, consider the case of the following two ideas or cognitions: Cognition 1: Pan masala causes mouth cancer which is fatal. Cognition 2: I eat pan masala. Here the two ideas are dissonant in the attitude towards pan masala. Therefore, one of these ideas will have to be changed so that consonance can be attained. Thus, to remove or reduce the dissonance, change Cognition 2. Thus Cognition 2 will become: I will stop eating pan masala.  Both balance and cognitive dissonance are examples of cognitive consistency. Cognitive consistency means that two components, aspects or elements of the attitude or attitude system must be in the same direction. The 2-step concept of attitude change was proposed by an Indian psychologist, S. M. Mohsin. Step 1: The target changes his attitude by identifying with the source. Step 2: The source shows an attitude change towards the attitude object. The target also shows an attitude change. This is a kind of imitation or observational learning. For example, Step 1: Preeti reads in newspaper that a particular soft drink she enjoys is harmful. But she imitates the sports person with whom she identifies. Step 2: The sports person having positive feelings towards his fans may change his habit of consuming the soft drink by substituting it with a health drink. Now, Preeti will also change her attitude and stop consuming the harmful soft drink.","Q. 2. State the factors that lead to the formation of attitudes.

"Explain social cognition. Discuss with examples the role of schemas in social cognition. [CBSE Delhi 2015, (AI) 2015]","Social cognition refers to all those psychological processes that deal with the gathering and processing of information related to social objects. For example, a teacher’s conclusions regarding a student’s behavior in school are quite different from his mother’s conclusion who observes him at home. Attitudes, impression formation and attribution are such processes which involve mental activities related to gathering and processing of information about the social world. Collectively this is called social cognition. Schemas guide social cognition. A schema is defined as a mental structure that provides a framework, set of rules or guidelines for processing information about any object. Schemas are the basic units stored in our memory and in case of social cognition; the basic units are social schemas. Most of the schemas are in the form of categories or classes. Schemas that function in the form of categories are called prototypes. Schemas reduce time and mental effort required in cognition. A stereotype is a cluster of ideas regarding the characteristics of a specific group. They are category-based schemas about a group of people. For example, a stereotype that Americans are hard-working. If you hear positive things about a group, the social schema about the group would be positive while when you hear negative things about the group, your social schema about the group would be in the form of negative stereotype. The effects of stereotypes are that they give rise to prejudices and biases about specific groups. ","Q. 1. Define attitude. Ans. An attitude is a set of views or opinions which have an evaluative feature (positive, negative or neutral quality) and is accompanied by ABC components namely affective, behavioural and cognitive components. For example, a positive attitude of students towards teachers and parents. Q. 2. What is belief? Ans. Beliefs refer to the cognitive component of attitudes such as belief in or belief in democracy Q. 3. What are values? Ans. alues are attitudes with a ‘should’ or ‘ought’ aspect, i.e., moral or ethical values. For example, one should work hard or one should be honest. Q. 4. What is a stereotype? Ans. A stereotype is a cluster of ideas regarding the characteristics of a specific group. They are category-based schemas about a group of people. For example, a stereotype that Americans are hardworking. Q. 5. Explain the concept of prejudice. Ans. Prejudices are negative attitudes towards a particular group and are based on stereotypes (the cognitive component). The cognitive component of prejudice is accompanied by dislike or hatred (the affective component). Prejudice gets translated into discrimination (the behavioural component) whereby people behave in less positive way towards a particular target group compared to another group which they favour. In our society there has been cases of discrimination due to prejudice based on gender, religion, community, caste, physical handicap and illness such as AIDS. Q. 6. What is cognition? Ans. Cognition refers to all those mental processes that deal with obtaining and processing of information. Q. 7. What is social cognition? Ans. Social cognition refers to all those psychological processes that deal with the gathering and processing of information related to social objects. For example, a teacher’sconclusions regarding a student’s behavior in school are quite different from his mother’s conclusion who observes him at home.

What is a prototype? Ans. Schemas that function in the form of categories are called prototypes. They are the entire set of features or qualities that help us to define an object clearly Q. 10. What is primacy effect? Ans. During formation of impression, information presented first has a stronger effect than information presented at the end. This is primacy effect. Q. 11. What is recency effect? Ans. During formation of impression, information that comes at the end may have stronger influence. This is recency effect. Q. 12. What is halo effect? Ans. During formation of impression, we have a tendency to think that a target person who has one set of positive qualities must have other positive qualities. This is known as halo effect. For example, if we are told that a person is ‘tidy’ and ‘punctual’, we are likely to think that the person must also be ‘hardworking’. Q. 13. What is social facilitation? Ans. Improvement in performance in the presence of others is called social facilitation. For example, cyclists racing with each other perform better than when they cycle alone. Q. 14. What is social inhibition? Ans. Decline in performance in the presence of others is called social inhibition. For example, if you recite a poem to an audience, your performance is inhibited than when you recite it to your teacher. Q. 15. Explain pro-social behaviour. Ans. Pro-social behavior or altruism is doing something or thinking about the welfare of others without any self-interest. For example, sharing things, cooperating with others,helping during natural calamities, showing sympathy, doing favours to others.

","These goals can be accomplished through: a. Education and information dissemination, for correcting stereotypes related to specific target groups and tackling the problem of strong ingroup bias. b. Increasing intergroup contact allows for direct communication, removal of mistrust between the groups and discovery of positive qualities in the outgroup. This strategy is successful if • The two groups meet in a cooperative rather than competitive context • Close interactions between the groups help them to know each other better • he two groups are not different in power or status. c.

When we meet people, we make inferences about their personal qualities. This is impression formation. For example, if a person is good looking we form impressions that the person would be sincere and hard-working. The person who forms the impression is called the perceiver. The individual about whom the impression is formed is called the target. Impression formation consists of the following subprocesses: i. ii. iii.
 Selection: Information is collected about target person. Organisation: Information is combined in a systematic way. Inference: A conclusion is drawn about the kind of person the target is.

Pro-social behaviour is reduced by factors such as bad mood, being busy with one’s own problems, or feeling that the person to be helped is responsible for his/her situation. viii. Pro-social behaviour is reduced when people are part of a large group. For example, when there is a road accident each person thinks that it is not his/her responsibility alone to give help and that someone else may take the responsibility which is not the case when the person is alone. The people are thus influenced by the phenomenon of the diffusion of responsibility.

"What is the meaning of assessment? Explain the methods used for psychological assessment. [CBSE Delhi 2014; (AI) 2011, 2012, 2014]","Assessment refers to the measurement of psychological attributes of individuals and their evaluation, often using multiple methods in terms of certain standards of comparison. For example, intellectual ability of a slow learner in a class would require testing Intelligence. Formal assessment is objective, standardized and organized while informal assessment varies from case to case and from one assessor to another and is open to subjective interpretations. The methods of assessment are: Psychological test: A psychological test is an objective and standardized measure of an individual’s mental or behavioural characteristics. For example, psychological tests measure psychological attributes such as intelligence, aptitude, personality, etc. Interview: Interview is a face-to-face interaction between two people. For example, an interview between a doctor and a patient, a salesman and a customer, employee selection by an employer. Case-study: A case-study is an in-depth study of an individual in terms of his psychological attributes, psychological history in the context of his physical and psychosocial environment. It is used by Clinical psychologists or a case analysis of great people is an example. Case-studies are based on data generated by different methods such as interview, observation, questionnaire, psychological tests etc. Observation: Observation involves employing systematic, organized and objective procedures to record behavior in a natural situation. For example, observing motherchild interactions. Self-report: Self-report is a method in which a person provides factual information about himself or herself or beliefs and opinions which he or she holds. For example, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire.","Q. 19. Differentiate between formal and informal assessment. Ans. Formal assessment is objective, standardized and organized while informal assessment varies from case to case, from one assessor to another and is open to subjective interpretations. Q. 20. Explain any two methods used for psychological assessment. (Write any two) Ans. The methods for psychological assessment are: Self-report Measures: These are fairly structured measures, often based on theory, that require subjects to give verbal responses using some kind of rating scale. The method requires the subject to objectively report her/his own feelings with respect to various items. The responses are accepted at their face value. They are scored in quantitative terms and interpreted on the basis of norms developed for the test. Projective Techniques: Projective techniques were developed to assess unconscious motives and feelings. These techniques are based on the assumption that a less structured or unstructured stimulus or situation will allow the individual to project her/his feelings, desires and needs on to that situation. These projections are interpreted by experts. A variety of projective techniques have been developed; they use various kinds of stimulus materials and situations for assessing personality. Some of them require reporting associations with stimuli (e.g., words, inkblots), some involve story writing around pictures, some require sentence completions, some require expression through drawings. Interview: This involves seeking information from a person on a one-to-one basis. This can be structured or unstructured. For example, an employer selecting employees for his/her organization. Observation: This involves employing systematic, organized and objective procedures to record behavioural phenomenon occurring in a natural situation. This can be participant or non-participant in nature. E.g., observing mother-child interactions. Q. 21. What is naturalistic observation? Ans. Naturalistic observation is observation in a natural setting. For example, observing how people behave in response to a heavy discount provided by a shop. Q. 22. Explain participant observation. Ans. In participant observation, the observer may become part of the group being observed. In this the observer takes some time to establish a rapport with the group so that they start accepting him/her as one of the group members. E.g., a teacher may become a part with students playing in the play-ground.
 Q. 23. Critically evaluate the method of behaviour rating for assessing personality. Ans. Behaviour ratings are used for assessment of personality in educational and industrial settings. In this individuals are put into certain categories in terms of their behavioural qualities. These ratings have drawbacks such as halo effect, middle category bias and extreme response bias. Q. 24. Describe nomination as a method of assessment. Ans. This method is used in obtaining peer assessment. In this each person is asked to choose one or more persons of the group with whom she/he would like to work, study, play or participate in a activity. The person may be asked to specify the reason for his or her choices. Q. 25. What are situational tests? Ans. The most commonly used test of this kind is the situational stress test. It involves a kind of role-playing in which a person performs a task with other persons who are noncooperative and interfering. Thus this test provides us with information about how a person behaves under stressful situations.

He described eight types of intelligence. They are as follows: I.
 Ans. On the basis of the nature of items used IQ tests are classified into Verbal, Non-verbal or Performance tests – Verbal tests require subjects to give verbal responses either orally or in a written form they can be administered only to literate people. E.g. Binet-Simon IQ test. In Nonverbal tests the subject has to complete a pattern in some picture or illustration. These reduce cultural biases. E.g. Standard Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM). Performance tests require subjects to manipulate objects such as wooden blocks to perform a task. Written language is not required for answering the items as well as can be administered to persons from different cultures. E.g. Koh’s Block design. Q. 11. Differentiate between Culture-fair and Culture-biased tests. [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. Depending upon the extent to which an intelligence test favours one culture over another, intelligence tests are classified as Culture-Fair or Culture-Biased tests. Culturefair tests are fair to a particular culture such as Non-verbal or Performance tests while culture-biased tests show a bias to the culture in which they are developed. For example, tests based on norms of urban society are culture-fair for urban society while culturebiased for rural society. Q. 12. What are the misuses of intelligence tests? Ans. Ill-effects of intelligence tests are: I. II. III. IV.
 Poor performance in a test may attach a stigma to children, thereby adversely affecting their performance and self-respect. Parents, teachers and elders may discriminate the children. Culture-biased IQ tests in favour of middle class and higher class population may underestimate the IQ of children coming from disadvantaged sections of the society. IQ tests do not capture creative potentialities and practical side of intelligence.

This involves using language fluently and flexibly. Persons high on this intelligence are ‘word-smart’. Poets and writers are strong in this component of intelligence. Logical-Mathematical: This involves skills in scientific thinking and problem solving. People high on this type of intelligence can think logically and critically. They engage in abstract reasoning and can manipulate symbols to solve mathematical problems. Scientists and Nobel Prize winners are strong in this component. Spatial: It refers to the abilities involved in forming, using and transforming mental images. Pilots, sailors, sculptures, painters, architects, interior decorators and surgeons are high in this type of intelligence. Musical: It is the capacity to produce, create and manipulate musical patterns. Persons high on this intelligence are sensitive to sounds and vibrations and increating new patterns of sounds and rhythms.  V.  VI.  VII.  VIII.  Bodily-Kinaesthetic: This involves using body flexibly and creatively. Athletes, dancers, actors, sports persons, gymnasts and surgeons are high in this intelligence. Interpersonal: This is the skill of understanding the motives, feelings and behaviours of other people so as to bond into a comfortable relationship withothers. Psychologists, counsellors, social workers, religious leaders are high on this component. Intrapersonal: This refers to the knowledge of one’s internal strengths and limitations and awareness of one’s own feelings, motives and desires. This relates to human existence and finding meaning in one’s life. Philosophers and spiritual leaders are high on this intelligence. Naturalistic: This is recognising the beauty of flora and fauna.

Describe different stages of personality development proposed by Freud.,"The stages of personality are: i.  ii.  iii.  iv.  Oral Stage: It spans between 0 to 1.5 years of age in which the newborn’s or the infant’s mouth is the pleasure seeking centre. The infant achieves oral gratification through feeding, thumb sucking, biting and babbling. Anal Stage: It spans between 1.5 to 3 years of age in which the anal area gives pleasurable feelings. The child experiences pleasure by retention or expulsion of bowels. Phallic Stage: This stage spans between 3 to 6 years of age and the pleasure seeking area are the genitals. The children begin to realize the relationship between males and females and become aware of the relationship between their parents. The male child experiences the Oedipus complex which involves love for the mother, hostility towards the father and the consequent fear of punishment or castration by the father (Oedipus was a Greek king who unknowingly killed his father and then married his mother). The girls at this stage develop Electra complex in which the girls shows love for their father and symbolically marry him and raise a family (Electra was a Greek character who induced her brother to kill their mother). By the end of this stage, the Oedipus complex and the Electra complex are resolved in which boys give up sexual feelings for their mothers and begin to see their fathers as role models rather than as rivals while the girls give up their sexual desires for their father and identify with their mother. Latency Stage: This stage spans between 6 to 12 years of age. During this period the child continues to grow physically, but sexual urges are relatively  inactive. Much of the child’s energy is channeled into social or achievementrelated activities.

What are defence mechanisms? Explain with examples.,"According to Freud, defence mechanisms are ways in which the ego unconsciously tries to cope with unacceptable Id desires or impulses. Human behaviour reflects an attempt to deal with or escape from anxiety. Freud described various defence mechanisms which people use to reduce anxiety by distorting reality. Defence mechanisms reduce anxiety temporarily. The optimum use of defence mechanisms is useful, normal and adaptive but excessive use is harmful which can even lead to distortion of reality and develop various forms of maladjustment and psychological problems. The various defence mechanisms are: i.  ii.  • •  iii. iv.  v.  vi.  Repression: In this anxiety-provoking behaviours or thoughts are totally dismissed by the unconscious. For example, when people repress a feeling or desire, they become totally unaware of that wish or desire. Projection: In this people attribute their own traits to others. For e.g. a person who has strong aggressive tendencies may see other people as acting in an excessively aggressive way towards him or her. By means of projection an individual. blames others for his own shortcomings, mistakes, anxiety, guilt, misdeeds. blames others for his own unacceptable impulses, thoughts and desires For example, a student failing in an examination blames the teacher for being unfair or the fate being bad (bad luck). Denial: In this a person totally refuses to accept reality. For example, someone suffering from HIV/AIDS may altogether deny his or her illness. Reaction Formation: In this a person defends against anxiety by adopting behaviours opposite to his or her true feelings. For example, a person with strong sexual urges channels his or her energy into religious fervour. Rationalisation: In this a person tries to make unreasonable feelings or behaviour seem reasonable and acceptable. For example, a person eats the chocolate giving the reason that it will melt in the sun in his pocket. Displacement: A frustrated person may show aggressive behaviour towards a weaker person. For example, members of a majority group in a society may be prejudiced against members of a minority group, and may show aggressive behaviour towards a minority group member, such as using abusive language or physically assaulting the minority group member.

For e.g. a person with strong sexual urges channelises his or her energy into religious fervour. Q. 16. What is meant by structured personality tests? Ans. Structured personality tests require subjects to give responses using some kind of rating scale. The subject reports his/her feeling objectively with respect to various items. For example, self-report measures. Q. 17. Elaborate the Existential theory of personality. Ans. Existentialism emphasizes avoiding powerlessness, loneliness, emptiness, and inability to find meaning and value in our lives. This can be achieved by taking responsibility and by living genuine and authentic lives. Q. 18. What is assessment? Ans. Assessment refers to measurement of psychological attributes of individuals and their evaluation using scientific testing procedures.

The subjects are shown the cards and are asked to tell what they see in each of the cards and where, how and what basis was a particular response made. Thematic Apperception Test (TAT): This test consists of black and white picture cards and a blank card. Each picture card depicts one or more people in a variety of situations. The cards are presented one at a time. The subject is asked to tell a story describing the situation presented in the picture: what led up to the situation, what is happening at the moment, what will happen in the future and what the characters are feeling and thinking. Rosenzweig’s Picture-Frustration Study (P-F Study): This test presents with the help of cartoon like pictures in which one person frustrates another or calls attention to a frustrating condition. Observation is made whether the subject protects the frustrated person or finds a constructive solution to the problem. The direction of aggression may be towards the environment, towards oneself or may be to avoid the situation. Sentence Completion Test: This test makes use of a number of incomplete sentences. The starting part of the sentence is first presented and the subject has to provide an ending to the sentence. These endings reflect the subject’s attitudes, motivation and conflicts. Examples of sentence completion tests are: My father ____________. My greatest fear is _____________. I am proud of _______________. Draw-a-Person Test: In this test the subject has to draw a person on a sheet of paper and then the figure of an opposite sex. Then the subject is asked to make a story about the person as if s/he was a character in a novel or play. Some examples of interpretations are: Omission of facial features suggests that the person tries to evade a highly conflict-ridden interpersonal relationship. Graphic emphasis on the neck suggests lack of control over impulses. Disproportionately large head suggests organic brain disease and pre-occupation with headaches.

"What do you understand by personality? Explain assessment of personality using behavioural analysis. [CBSE Delhi 2011; (AI) 2011, 2015]","Personality refers to our characteristic ways of responding to individuals and situations. For example, a person who is socially active, assertive, talkative and funloving is an extravert personality. The methods for personality assessment using behavioural analysis are: Interview: This involves seeking information from a person on a one-to-one basis. This can be structured or unstructured. For example, an employer selecting employees for his/her organization. Behaviour ratings are used for assessment of personality in educational and industrial settings. In this, individuals are put into certain categories in terms of their behavioural qualities. These ratings have drawbacks such as halo effect, middle category bias and extreme response bias. This method is used in obtaining peer assessment. In this each person is asked to choose one or more persons of the group with whom s/he would like to work, study, play or participate in an activity. The person may be asked to specify the reason for his or her choices. The most commonly used test of this kind is the situational stress test. It involves a kind of role-playing in which a person performs a task with other persons, who are noncooperative and interfering. Thus, this test provides us with information about how a person behaves under stressful situations.","Q. 14. Explain the techniques of behavioural analysis used in personality assessment.
 Ans. The techniques of behavioural analysis used in personality assessment are: Interview: This involves seeking information from a person on a one-to-one basis. This can be structured or unstructured. For example, an employer selecting employees for his/her organization. Observation: This involves employing systematic, organized and objective procedures to record behavioural phenomenon occurring in a natural situation. This can be participant or non-participant in nature. E.g. observing mother-child interactions. Behaviour ratings are used for assessment of personality in educational and industrial settings. In this individuals are put into certain categories in terms of their behavioural qualities. These ratings have drawbacks such as halo effect, middle category bias and extreme response bias. Nomination: This method is used in obtaining peer assessment. In this each person is asked to choose one or more persons of the group with whom s/he would like to work, study, play or participate in a activity. The person may be asked to specify the reason for his or her choices. Situational Tests: The most commonly used test of this kind is the situational stress test. It involves a kind of role-playing in which a person performs a task with other persons who are non-cooperative and interfering.

OR Explain behaviour ratings used in assessment of personality. [CBSE Delhi 2014; (AI) 2014] Ans. In Behavioural ratings the subjects are asked to put individuals whom they know into categories in terms of their behavioural qualities. The categories may involve numbers or descriptive adjectives. Behaviour ratings are used for assessment of personality in educational and industrial settings. In this, individuals are put into certain categories or ratings in terms of their behavioural qualities such as strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree and strongly agree. Limitations of behaviour ratings are: a. A favourable or unfavourable trait forms a basis of a rater’s overall judgment of a person. This tendency is known as halo effect. b. Raters have a tendency to place individuals either in the middle of the scale (called middle category bias) or in extreme positions (called extreme response bias).

Describe the key features of self-report measures used in personality assessment.,"Key features of self-report measures are: i.  ii.  iii.  In psychology, a self-report is a test, measure, or survey that relies on the individual’s own report of their symptoms, behaviors, beliefs, or attitudes. Selfreport data is gathered from paper-and-pencil or electronic format, or sometimes through an interview. Self-reports are commonly used in psychological studies largely because much valuable and diagnostic information about a person is revealed to a researcher or a clinician based on a person’s report on himself or herself. One of the most commonlyused self-report tools is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) for personality testing. One of the primary advantages of self-report data is that it can be easily obtained. It is one of the instrumental ways that clinicians diagnose their patients—by asking questions. Those making the self-report are usually familiar with filling outquestionnaires. For research, it is an inexpensive tool that can  iv.  v. •  •  reach many more test subjects than could be analyzed by observation or other methods. It can be performed relatively quickly so a researcher can obtain results in days or weeks rather than observing a population over the course of longer time frames. The self-reports can be made in private and can be anonymized to protect sensitive information and perhaps promote truthful responses. Collecting information through a self-report, however, has its limitations As people are often biased when they report on their own experiences. For example, many individuals are either consciously or unconsciously influenced by ‘social desirability,’ that is, they are more likely to report experiences that are considered to be socially acceptable or preferred. This ‘multi-modal’ or ‘multi-method’ assessment provides a more global and therefore likely more accurate picture of the subject.

Elaborate any three psychological (therapeutic) models proposed to treat mental disorders. What are the different types of psycho-therapy? Explain the principles on which humanistic-existential therapy is based. The different types of psycho-therapies are: i. ii. iii.  Psychodynamic therapy Behaviour therapy Existential therapy [CBSE (AI) 2013] ,"i.  ii.  iii.  Psychodynamic therapy: According to Psychodynamic therapy intra-psychic conflict are the source of psychological problems. The unfulfilled desires of childhood and unresolved childhood fears lead to intra-psychic conflicts. Psychodynamic therapy uses the methods of free association and reporting of dreams to elicit the thoughts and feelings of the client. This material is interpreted to the client to help him/ her confront and resolve the conflicts and thus overcome problems. The therapist understands and interprets the thoughts and feelings of the client. The client’s symptoms and distresses reduce as a consequence of the development of emotional insight. Behaviour therapy: According to behaviour therapies, psychological problems arise due to faulty learning of behaviours and cognitions. The faulty conditioning patterns, faulty learning and faulty thinking and beliefs lead to maladaptive behaviours that lead to psychological problems. Behaviour therapy identifies the faulty conditioning patterns and sets up alternate behavioural contingencies to improve behaviour and overcome psychological distress. Behaviour therapists are capable of arriving at solutions to the client’s problems. Adaptive and healthy behaviour and thought patterns replace faulty behaviour and ensures removal of symptoms. Existential therapy: These therapies postulate that the questions about the meaning of one’s life and existence are the cause of psychological problems. It gives importance to the present wherein the current feelings of loneliness, alienation, sense of futility of one’s existence causes psychological problems. The existential therapy provides a therapeutic environment which is positive, accepting, warm, empathic and non-judgmental. The therapist acts as a facilitator  in which the client arrives at the solutions through the process of personal growth. Thus the client understands oneself and one’s aspirations, emotions and motives. The principles underlying humanistic existential psychotherapy are i. ii.  iii.  Psychological distress arises from feelings of loneliness, alienation and inability to find meaning and genuine fulfillment in life. Human beings are motivated by the desire for personal growth and selfactualisation, and an innate need to grow emotionally. When these needs are curbed by society and family, human beings experience psychological distress. Frustration of self actualisation also causes distress. The humanistic-existential therapies encourage personal growth and actualise the potential. Self actualisation requires free emotional expression. The family and society curb emotional expression which leads to destructive behaviour and negative emotions by thwarting the process of emotional expression. The therapist is merely facilitator and guide. It is the client who is responsible for the success of the therapy by the process of self-growth through which healing takes place.  The therapy creates a permissive, non-judgmental and accepting atmosphere in which the client’s emotions can be freely expressed and the complexity, balance and integration could be achieved. The fundamental assumption is that the client has the freedom and responsibility to control his/her own behaviour and the chief aim of the therapy is to expand the client’s awareness.","Psychodynamic therapy: According to Psychodynamic therapy intra-psychic conflict are the source of psychological problems.

Discuss the relevance of psychodynamic approach to social adjustment.,"Psychodynamic therapy uses free association and dream interpretation as important methods for eliciting the psychological conflicts. A therapeutic relationship is established and the client feels comfortable, the therapist makes him/her lie down on the couch, close his/her eyes and asks him/her to speak whatever comes to mind without censoring it in anyway. The client is encouraged to freely associate one thought with another, and this method is called the method of free association. A relaxed and trusting atmosphere is created and as the therapist does not interrupt the free flow of ideas, desires and the conflicts of the unconscious, which had been suppressed by the ego, emerge into the conscious mind. Along with this technique, the client is asked to write down his/her dreams upon waking up. According to psychoanalysts, dreams are symbols of unfulfilled desires and are the royal road to the unconscious. As the unconscious forces are brought into the conscious realm through free association and dream interpretation, the client starts identifying with the therapist with the authority figures of the past, usually childhood. The therapist is seen as a punitive father or as a negligent mother. The therapist maintains a non-judgmental and permissive attitude and allows the client to continue with this process of emotional identification. This is the process of transference. The client expresses his/her  frustrations, anger, fear and depression that had been suppressed during the early childhood years. The therapist acts as the substitute for an authority figure and this stage is called transference neurosis. When the client idolizes or falls in love with the therapist and seeks the therapist’s approval, positive transference takes place while when the client has feelings of hostility, anger and resentment towards the therapist negative transference occurs. The process of transference is met with resistance. Since the process of transference exposes the unconscious wishes and conflicts, thereby increasing the distress levels, the client resists transference. Due to resistance, the client opposes the progress of therapy in order to protect himself/herself from the recall of painful unconscious memories. Resistance can be conscious or unconscious. Conscious resistance is present when the client deliberately hides some information. Unconscious resistance is present when the client becomes silent during the therapy session, recalls trivial details without recalling the emotional ones, misses appointments and comes late for therapy sessions. Change is effected by interpretation through confrontation and clarification. In confrontation, the therapist points out to the client an aspect of his/her psyche that must be faced by the client. Clarification is the process by which the therapist brings a vague or confusing event into sharp focus. The therapist uses the unconscious material that has been uncovered in the process of free association, dream interpretation, transference and resistance to make the client aware of the psychic contents and conflicts which have led to the occurrence of symptoms. The repeated process of using confrontation, clarification and interpretation is known as working through. The outcome of working through is insight. During insight, the unconscious memories are repeatedly integrated into conscious awareness. Therapy is complete when the client starts to understand himself/herself better a intellectual and emotional level and gains insight into his/her conflicts and problems. Psychoanalysis lasts for several years, with one hour session for 4-5 days per week. It takes place in 3 stages: Stage one is the initial phase when the patient becomes familiar with the routines, establishes a therapeutic relationship with the analyst, and gets some relief with the process of recollecting the superficial materials from the consciousness about the past and present troublesome events. Stage two is the middle phase, which is characterized by transference, resistance on the part of the patient, and confrontation and clarification, i.e. working through on the therapist’s part. All these processes finally lead to insight. The third phase is the termination phase wherein the relationship with the analyst is dissolved and the patient prepares to leave the therapy.

Describe the method of treatment in behavior therapy.,"During behaviour therapy treatment is to extinguish or eliminate the faulty behaviors which cause distress and substitute them with adaptive behaviour patterns. Behavioural analysis is to find malfunctioning behaviours, the antecedents of faulty learning and the factors that maintain or continue faulty learning. Malfunctioning behaviours are those behaviours that cause distress to the client. Antecedent factors are those causes which predispose the person to indulge in that behaviour. Maintaining factors are those which lead to the persistence of the faulty behaviour. For example, in the malfunctioning behavior of smoking, the anxiety-provoking situation is the causative or antecedent factor. The feeling of relief is the maintaining factor to continue smoking. The method of treatment is through establishing antecedent operations and consequent operations. Antecedent operations control behaviour by changing something that precedes a behavior. Establishing operation is to increase or decrease the reinforcing value of a particular consequence. For example, if a child gives trouble in eating dinner, an establishing operation would be to decrease the quantity of food served at tea time. Praising the child when s/he eats properly tends to encourage this behaviour. The antecedent operation is the reduction of food at tea time and the consequent operation is praising the child for eating dinner.","client.

 Ans. The principles of behaviour techniques are to reduce the arousal level of the client, alter behaviour through classical conditioning with different contingencies of reinforcement as well as to use vicarious learning procedures. Negative reinforcement refers to following an undesired response with an outcome that is painful or not liked. For example, the teacher reprimands a child who shouts in class. Aversive conditioning refers to repeated association of undesired response with an aversive consequence. For example, an alcoholic is given a mild electric shock and asked to smell the alcohol which leads to his leaving alcohol. If an adaptive behaviour occurs rarely, positive reinforcement increases the deficit. If a child does not do homework regularly, positive reinforcement may be used by the child’s mother by preparing the child’s favourite dish which increases the behaviour of doing homework at appointed time. Differential reinforcement is an effective method wherein positive reinforcement is given for wanted behaviour while negative reinforcement is given for unwanted

 behaviour. If a child cries for not being taken to cinema, the parent ignores the child when s/he cries and taken to cinema when s/he shows wanted behaviour. Systematic desensitization is a technique used in behavior therapy introduced by Wolpe for treating phobias or irrational fears. The therapist prepares a hierarchy of anxiety-provoking stimuli with the least anxiety-provoking stimuli at the bottom of the hierarchy. The therapist relaxes the client and asks the client to think of the least anxiety-provoking situation. The client is asked to stop thinking of the fearful situation if the slightest tension is felt. Over sessions, the client is able to imagine more severe fear provoking situations while maintaining the relaxation. The client gets systematically desensitized to the fear. The process of systematic desensitization is based on the principle of reciprocal inhibition which states that two mutually opposing forces inhibits the weaker force. Persons with behavioural problems can be given a token as are reward every time a wanted behaviour occurs. This is known as Token Economy. Modelling is the procedure which uses the procedure of vicarious learning wherein the client learns to behave in a certain way by observing the behaviour of the therapist who acts as the role model. Vicarious learning is learning by observing others. It is the process of rewarding small changes in the behaviour, the client gradually learns to acquire the behaviour of the model. Q. 6. What is psychotherapy? Discuss the factors that contribute to healing in psychotherapy. [CBSE (AI) 2012] Ans. Psychotherapy involves a voluntary, helping relationship that involves someone seeking help and someone trained to give help, in a setting that permits help to be given and received. The purpose of the relationship is to help the client to solve the psychological problems faced by him or her. The relationship is conducive for building the trust of the client so that problems may be freely discussed. Psychotherapies aim at changing the maladaptive behaviours, decreasing the sense of personal distress, and helping the client to adapt better to his environment. Psychotherapy is a treatment of psychological distress. There are several processes which contribute to the healing process: i. ii. iii. iv.

If a child cries for not being taken to cinema, the parent ignores the child when s/he cries and taken to cinema when s/he shows wanted behaviour. Systematic desensitization is a technique used in behavior therapy introduced by Wolpe for treating phobias or irrational fears. The therapist prepares a hierarchy of anxiety-provoking stimuli with the least anxiety-provoking stimuli at the bottom of the hierarchy. The therapist relaxes the client and asks the client to think of the least anxiety-provoking situation. The client is asked to stop thinking of the fearful situation if the slightest tension is felt. Over sessions, the client is able to imagine more severe fear provoking situations while maintaining the relaxation. The client gets systematically desensitized to the fear. The process of systematic desensitization is based on the principle of reciprocal inhibition which states that two mutually opposing forces inhibits the weaker force. Persons with behavioural problems can be given a token as are reward every time a wanted behaviour occurs. This is known as Token Economy. Modelling is the procedure which uses the procedure of vicarious learning wherein the client learns to behave in a certain way by observing the behaviour of the therapist who acts as the role model. Vicarious learning is learning by observing others. It is the process of rewarding small changes in the behaviour, the client gradually learns to acquire the behaviour of the model.","Ans. The principles of behaviour techniques are to reduce the arousal level of the client, alter behaviour through classical conditioning with different contingencies of reinforcement as well as to use vicarious learning procedures. Negative reinforcement refers to following an undesired response with an outcome that is painful or not liked. For example, the teacher reprimands a child who shouts in class. Aversive conditioning refers to repeated association of undesired response with an aversive consequence. For example, an alcoholic is given a mild electric shock and asked to smell the alcohol which leads to his leaving alcohol. If an adaptive behaviour occurs rarely, positive reinforcement increases the deficit. If a child does not do homework regularly, positive reinforcement may be used by the child’s mother by preparing the child’s favourite dish which increases the behaviour of doing homework at appointed time.

What is psychotherapy? Discuss the factors that contribute to healing in psychotherapy. [CBSE (AI) 2012] Ans. Psychotherapy involves a voluntary, helping relationship that involves someone seeking help and someone trained to give help, in a setting that permits help to be given and received. The purpose of the relationship is to help the client to solve the psychological problems faced by him or her. The relationship is conducive for building the trust of the client so that problems may be freely discussed. Psychotherapies aim at changing the maladaptive behaviours, decreasing the sense of personal distress, and helping the client to adapt better to his environment. Psychotherapy is a treatment of psychological distress. There are several processes which contribute to the healing process: i. ii. iii. iv.

Nonspecific factors attributable to the client/patient are motivation for change, expectation or improvement due to treatment. Non-specific factors attributable to  the therapist are positive nature, absence of unresolved emotional conflicts, presence of good mental health.  ","There is systematic application of principles underlying the different theories of therapy, Persons who have received practical training under expert supervision can practice psychotherapy, and not everybody. An untrained person may unintentionally cause more harm than any good, The therapeutic situation involves a therapist and a client who seeks and receives help for his/her emotional problems, The interaction of these two persons – the therapist and the client – results in the consolidation or formation of the therapeutic relationship. This is a confidential,interpersonal and dynamic relationship. This human relationship is central to any sort of psychological therapy and is the vehicle for change.

The effects of noise on human behaviour are: i.  ii. iii.  iv.  v. vi. vii.  Simple task: When the task being performed is a simple mental task such as addition of numbers, noise does not affect overall performance whether it is loud or soft. In such situations, people adapt or ‘get used’ to noise. Interesting task: If the task being performed is very interesting, the presence of noise does not affect performance. Predictability of noise: When the noise comes at intervals and in an unpredictable way, it is experienced more disturbing than if the noise is continuously present. Difficulty of task: When the task being performed is difficult, or requires full concentration, then intense, unpredictable, and uncontrollable noise reduces the level of task performance. Controllability of noise: When tolerating or switching off the noise is within the control of the person, the number of errors in task performance decreases. Intensity of noise: Above a certain level noise can lead to annoyance or even sleep disturbances. Emotional effects of loud noise: Noise above a certain level causes annoyance, and can also lead to sleep disturbance. ","Q. 3. What are the effects of noise on human behaviour?

Crowding and high density may lead to abnormal behavior and aggression. For example, rats in a highly populated enclosed space show aggressive behaviour such as biting the tails of other rats. Crowding leads to lowered performance on different tasks that involve cognitive processes and has adverse effects on memory and emotional state. Children growing up in very crowded households show lower academic performance and experience greater conflict with their parents. The nature of social interaction determines the degree to which an individual will react to crowding. For example, if the interaction is a party, the presence of large number of people does not cause stress. In cultures that emphasize the importance of the group or collectivity over the individual, the presence of large number of people is not considered undesirable while in cultures where individualism is given more importance, crowding is experienced as stressful.

Poor lack the ability and motivation to put in effort and make use of available opportunities. The belief system called ‘the culture of poverty’ convinces the person that she/he will continue to remain poor and the belief is carried from one generation of the poor to the next.

People living in deserts that have shortage of natural resources or in regions where there is harsh climate such as extreme heat or cold end up being poor. Poverty cycle in which poverty begets poverty explains why poverty continues among the same sections of society. Due to low income and lack of resources, the poor go through low health and nutrition, lack of education and lack of skills. This leads to low employment opportunities, which, in turn, continue their low income condition, and low health and nutrition status. The resulting lowered motivational level only makes the situation worse; the cycle starts and continues again.

Why do people join groups?,"People join groups because they satisfy a range of needs: i.  ii.  iii. iv. v. vi.  Security: When we are alone we feel insecure. Groups reduce this insecurity. Being with people gives a sense of comfort and protection. As a result, people feel stronger and less vulnerable to threats. Status: People feel recognised, important and experience a sense of power. For example, your school wins in inter-school debate, you feel proud and think that you are better than others. Self-esteem: Groups provide feelings of self-worth and give positive social identity.

Give one incident of social loafing in school. Why does it happen? Give the ways of reducing social loafing. How can social loafing be reduced in group work?   ,"Individuals work less hard in a group than they do when performing alone. This phenomenon is referred to as social loafing. Social loafing is a reduction in individual effort when working on a collective task. This occurs because: i. ii. iii. iv. v.  Group members feel less responsible for the overall task being performed and therefore exert less effort. Motivation of members decreases because they realize that their contribution will not be evaluated on individual basis. The performance of the group is not compared with other groups. There is improper coordination among members. Belonging to the same group is not important for members.  For example, students competing in a game of tug-of-war. Similarly, in an experiment, a group of people were asked to clap or cheer as loudly as possible. Results showed that the amount of nose produced by each participant dropped as the size of the group decreased. It is possible to identify how much force each member of the team has been exerting. Such situations give opportunities to group members to relax and become a free rider. The various ways of reducing social loafing: i. ii. iii. iv.  Making the efforts of each person identifiable.

Explain the nature of stress giving examples. Discuss avoidance-oriented strategy of coping. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Explain the nature of stress giving examples. 2015]  [CBSE Delhi ,"Nature of Stress: The term ‘stress’ has been originated from the Latin word Strictus, meaning tight or narrow. Stress is described as the pattern of responses an organism makes to stimulus event that disturbs the equilibrium and exceeds a person’s ability to cope. Stressors like noise, crowding, a bad relationship, daily commuting to school or office are events that cause our body to give the stress response. Eustress describes the level of stress that is good and positive and is one of a person’s best assets for achieving peak performance and managing minor crisis. Distress is the manifestation of stress that causes our body’s wear and tear. It produces unpleasant effects, hampers our productivity, emotionally upsets us and causes our performance to deteriorate. Stress is often explained in terms of characteristics of the environment that are disruptive to the individual. Stressors are events that cause our body to give the stress response. Such events include noise, crowding, a bad relationship, or the daily commuting to school or office. The reaction to external stressors is called ‘strain’. Lazarus has distinguished between two types of appraisal, i.e. primary and secondary. The perception of stress is dependent upon the individual’s cognitive appraisal which is of two types, primary and secondary. Primary appraisal refers to the perception of a new or changing environment as positive, neutral or negative in its consequences. Negative events are appraised for their possible harm, threat or challenge. Harm is the assessment of the damage that has already been done by the event. Threat is the assessment of the possible future damage that may be brought about by the event. Challenge is associated with expectations of the ability to cope with the stressful event. Secondary appraisal is the assessment of one’s coping abilities and resources and whether they will be sufficient to meet the harm, threat or challenge of the event.  Selye observed that animals exposed to stressors show a similar pattern of bodily response. He called this pattern General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS). According tohim GAS involves three stages Alarm reaction, Resistance Stage and Exhaustion stage. Coping is a dynamic situation-specific reaction to stress. E.g. watching TV, phone up a friend or try to be with other people. Avoidance-oriented strategy: This involves denying or minimizing the seriousness of the situation. It involves conscious suppression of stressful thoughts and their replacement by self-protective thoughts. Examples of this are watching TV, phone up a friend or try to be with other people.","Ans.

Deep breathing and muscle  ii.  iii.  iv.  v.  vi.  relaxation is used to relax the mind and body which starts from the lower part of the body and progresses up to the facial muscles. Meditation Procedures: This technique refocuses the attention that brings about an altered state of consciousness. This is possible through concentration so that the mediator is unaware of any outside stimulation. Biofeedback: This involves three stages: developing an awareness of the particular physiological response, e.g. heart rate, learning ways of controlling that physiological response in quiet conditions; and transferring that control into the conditions of everyday life. Creative Visualisation: This involves imagery and imagination for keeping one’s mind quiet, body relaxed and eyes closed. This reduces the risk of interference from unhidden thoughts and provides the creative energy needed for turning an imagined scene into reality. Cognitive Behavioural Techniques: This approach involves replacing negative and irrational thoughts with positive and rational ones. It includes assessment, stress reduction techniques, and application and follow-through. Assessment involves discussing the nature of the problem and seeing it from the viewpoint of the client. Stress reduction involves learning the techniques of reducing stress such as relaxation and self-instruction.
