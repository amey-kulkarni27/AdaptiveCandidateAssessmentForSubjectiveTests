0,Q. 1. What is a tester ?,"Ans. The instrument that is used to check the flow of electric current is called tester. It is attached to the terminals of the electric circuits. If the bulb of the tester glows, it confirms that current is flowing through the circuit."
1,Q. 2. The bulb does not glow in the setup shown. List the possible reasons. Explain your answer. ,Ans. The bulb does not glow due to the following reasons :  Bulb may be fused.  Liquid is non-conducting.  Cells may be used up.  Connections of the circuit may be loose.
2,"Q. 3. Does pure water conduct electricity ? If not, what can we do to make it conducting ? ","Ans. Pure water is bad conductor of electricity. To make it conducting, some salt may be added into water. The dissolved salt makes it a good conductor of electricity."
3,Q. 4. Is it safe for the electrician to carry out electrical repair outdoors during heavy down pour ? Explain. ,"Ans. No, it is highly dangerous to carry out electric repair out door during heavy down pour because rain water and our body both are highly conducting and electricity can easily pass through. Thus, we experience high shock and it may cause electrocution."
4,"Q. 5. Paheli had heard that rain water is as good as distilled water. Hence, she collected some rain water using a tester. To her surprise she found that the compass needle showed deflection. What could be the reasons ? ","Ans. Paheli had heard a truth that rain water is as good as distilled water. But the dissolved impurities present in atmosphere enter into it and makes it a good conductor. So, it shows deflection when she checks it with a tester. 2"
5,Q. 6. Prepare a list of objects around you that are electroplated. ,Ans. Objects that are generally electro-plated are as follows : — Ornaments. — Wheel rims of vehicles. — Tin cans. — Handles of vehicles. — Electric decorative appliances. — Kitchen gas burner. — Fan blades. — Pots of metals — Utensils etc. — Door and window handles.
6,Q. 7. The ordinary water can conduct electricity while distilled water can not. Explain why ?,"Ans. The ordinary water that we get from the tap, river, lakes and ponds is not as pure as distilled water. It contains so many impurities in the form of salts. These impurities make it good conductor of electricity. As distilled water is free from salt, it is unable to conduct electricity."
7,Q. 7. Write a short note on LED.,"Ans. LEDs are Light Emitting Diodes. They are used to check electric current. Even when a weak electric current flows through it, they glows. These are available in many colours such as red, green, yellow, blue and white. LEO has two wires, one is longer and the other is shorter. Larger wire is connected with + ve terminal and – ve to the shorter terminals. 2"
8,Q. 7. When do you need magnetic compass to test the conduction of electricity ?,"Ans. If current is small, the bulb does not glow on passing electric current through the tester. Hence to check the small current we need magnetic compass to test the conduction. 2"
9,Q. 7. Can some fruits and vegetables conduct electricity ? Explain with an example.,"Ans. Some fruits and vegetables also conduct electricity. It is explained with the following example. Potato Fig. Experiment to show Potato conducts electricity Cut a potato into two halves. Insert the copper wires of a tester into it. Keep it for an hour. There appears a greenish blue spot on the potato around one wire. It is because the current produces a chemical effect on potato. Hence, it is clear that vegetables conduct electricity."
10,"Q. 1. Experimentally prove that solutions of acids, bases and salts conduct electricity.","Ans. The solutions of acids, bases and salts conduct electricity. This can be experimentally proved by following method : — Take three clean plastic or rubber caps of bottles. — Pour about two teaspoon full of distilled water in each of them. — Add few drops of lemon juice in one cap. — Add a few drops of as base as caustic soda in second cap. — Add little salt to third cap to form salt solution. — Now conduct electricity through each. An electric current flows through all the conducting solutions thus indicaning that acids, bases and salts conduct electricity. 3"
11,Q. 2. What are the chemical effects of electric current ? Explain with an example.,"Ans. Chemical effects of electric current can be explained by following experiment : — Take two carbon rods with metal caps. Clean their metal cap. Metal cap Carbon rod Carbon rod Water Fig. : Passing current through water — Wrap copper wires around the metal caps of the carbon rods and join them to a battery. — Pour a cup full of water in a glass bowl and add a tea, spoon of salt. — Immerse the electrodes in solution but metal caps should be out of the water. — Wait for 5 min. — Observe the electrodes. — The passage of an electric current through a conducting solution causes chemical reaction. As a result, bubbles of gas are formed in the electrode. Deposits of metal may be seen on electrodes. Change of colour of solution may occur. These are some of the chemical effects of the electric current. 3"
12,Q. 3. Discuss two methods of testing a conductor or an insulator.,"Ans. The following methods are used to test the conduction :  The conductivity of substance can be checked by using electric bulb. When the liquid between the two ends of the tester allows the electric current to pass, the circuit of the tester becomes complete. The current flows in the circuit and the bulb glows. If the circuit of tester is not complete the bulb does not glow. This method does not work when current is very small. Lemon Juice Fig. : Testing Conduction of Electricity  We can use another effect of an electric current to test the conduction. A magnetic tester is also used to test conductivity. When current is allowed to pass through it, it creates a magnetic field and the compass shows deflection. The deflection of compass shows that the current is passing through circuit.
