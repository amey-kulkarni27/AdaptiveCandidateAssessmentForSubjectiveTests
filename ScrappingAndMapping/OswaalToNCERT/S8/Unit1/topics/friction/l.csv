Give examples to show that friction is both a friend and a foe.,"Friction is a friend because :  we can not write with pen or pencil, if there is no friction.  we are unable to write on the black board with a chalk.  if an object starts moving, it would never stop.  the vehicles cannot be started or stopped.  we cannot fix a nail on the wall or tie a knot without friction Friction as foe because :  it wears out materials whether they are screws, ball bearings.  the shoes wear out due to friction.  friction also produces heat. When a machine is operated, heat is generated that causes wastage of energy.  the tyres of cars, buses and trucks etc also wear out due to friction.  Friction reduces the speed due to which more force is required."
Discuss the various ways to reduce the friction.,"Friction may be reduced in the following ways :  Polishing the surface : We polish the rubbing surfaces to reduce their unevenness and make them smooth.  Lubricating the surface : To reduce friction in order to increase efficiency when oil, grease or graphite is applied between the moving parts of a machine, a thin layer is formed there and moving surfaces do not directly rub against each other. These substances are lubricants which reduce the friction.  Using wheels and ball bearings : By using wheels and ball bearing we convert sliding friction into rolling friction. This reduces friction between the two contact surfaces and helps us to save energy, effort and time.  Streamlining : Objects are to given special shapes, such as streamlined body to aeroplanes. Their bodies shapes them and make them lose less energy in overcoming friction. Hence, all vehicles are designed to have shapes that reduce fluid friction."
Name the factors that affect friction.,Factors affecting friction :  It depends on the nature of surfaces in contact.  It is more between rough surfaces and less between smooth surfaces.  It depends on how hard the two surfaces press together.  It is independent of the area of contact.
