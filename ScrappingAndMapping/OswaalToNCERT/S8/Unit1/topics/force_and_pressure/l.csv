0,Q. 1. Experimentally explain that pressure is exerted by liquid and gases on the wall of the containers.,"Ans. Pressure exerted by liquid and gases on the wall of container can be explained by the following experiments. Take a plastic bottle. Fix a cylindrical glass tube  near its bottom. Make sure that the water does not leak from the joint. Cover the mouth of glass tube with a thin rubber sheet. Fill the bottle upto half with water. The bulging of the rubber sheet in the case indicates that water exerts pressure on the sides of container or we can say that liquid exerts pressure on the walls of container. In the case of gas, when we inflate a balloon the balloon will be filled with air and air exerts pressure and its shape has changed. So we find that gases, too, exert pressure on the walls of their container."
1,Q. 2. What are contact and non-contact forces ? Explain briefly with suitable examples.,"Ans. Forces can be of two types : 1. Contact forces. 2. Non-contact forces.  Contact forces : The forces that come into play when two objects come in contact with each other.  Muscular force : The force which is exerted due to action of muscles is known as the muscular force. e.g., running, bending, walking etc.  Frictional Force : The force respoonsible for changing the state of motion of an object. Equal and opposite forces are being exerted on an object when its surface comes in contact with other surface. e.g., a car or scooter comes to rest.  Non-contact forces : The forces that can be exerted from a distance without establishing a contact are called the noncontact forces.  Magnetic force : Force exerted by a magnet on another magnet or magnetic substance like iron is called magnetic force.  Electrostatic force : Force exerted by a charged body on another charged body or uncharged body is called electrostatic force. e.g., If we rub a comb with hair and bring it near some small bits of paper it attracts the bits of paper towards itself. This is electrostatic force.  Force of gravity : The earth pulls every freely falling object towards its centre. The force exerted by the Earth is called the force of gravity."
