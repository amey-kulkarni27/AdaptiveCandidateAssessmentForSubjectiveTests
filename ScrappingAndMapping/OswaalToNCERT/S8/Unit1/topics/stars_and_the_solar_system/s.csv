Draw a diagram to show that earth accompanied by the moon is revolving around the Sun.,Fig. : Earth accompained by moon revolving arond the Sun.
Describe the surface of the moon.,The moon’s surface is dusty and barren. There are many craters of different sizes. It also has a large numbers of steep and high mountains. It has no atmosphere and no water.
What is a star ? Why does it appear so small ?,"Stars are celestial bodies that emit light of their own. They are million times farther away than the Sun. Therefore, the stars appear to us like points."
Why does pole star not appear to be moving?,Since the pole star is situated in the direction of the Earth’s axis. So it does not appear to move.
What is the Sun ?,The Sun is a star. It is the nearest star from us. It is continuously emitting huge amounts of heat and light. It is the source of almost all energy on the Earth. It is also a source of heat and light for all the planets.
What is the difference between stars and planets ?,Difference between stars and planets : Stars  Star twinkles in the sky.  They are fixed at a point.  They have their own light.  They are very big in size. Planets They do not twinkle. They revolve around the Sun. They have no light. They are smaller in comparison to stars.
What is an orbit ?,A planet has definite path in which it revolves around the Sun. This path is called as orbit. 2
What is an Asteroid ?,There is a large gap between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. This gap is occupied by a large number of small objects that revolve around the Sun. These are called asteroids. It can be only seen through large telescopes.
What is a meteor ?,"Sometimes we see bright streaks of light in the sky. These are commonly known as shooting stars, although they are meteors. It is usuallya small object that occasionally enters into the Earths atmosphere. At the time when they are at high speed, due to friction they glow and evaporate quickly. Hence, bright streak lasts for a very short time."
What is a meteorite ?,Some meteors are large and so they can reach the Earth before they evaporate completely. The body that reaches the Earth is called a meteorite.
How are phases of moon formed ?,"The day on which the whole disc of the moon is visible is known as full moon day. Thereafter, every night the size of the bright part of the moon becomes thinner and thinner. On the fifteenth day the moon is not visible, which is known as new moon day. The next day, only a small portion of the moon appears in the sky, known as crescent and then again the moon grows larger every day. On 15th day again we get full view of the moon. These various shapes are called phases. We see different phases of moon as a result of difference in sunlight reflected by moon. Difference in sunlight incident on moons surface arises due to revolution of moon around the earth."
Write in brief about any two constellations.,"Ursa Major : We can see it during summer time in the early part of the night. It is also known as Big Dipper, the great bear or the Saptarishi. There are seven prominent stars in this. It appears like a big dipper or a question mark. Three stars in the handle of the ladle and four in its bowl. Orion : It is seen during winters in late evening. It have seven or eight bright stars. It is also called hunter. Three middle stars"
Write the difference between revolution and rotation.,Difference between revolution and rotation. Rotation Revolution  The time taken by a planet to complete one revolution is called its period of revolution.  The period of revo lution increases as the distance of the planet increases from the Sun. A planet also rotates on its own axis like a top. The time taken by a planet to complete one rotation is called its period of rotation. It is always fixed.
What are artificial satellites ? What are their uses ?,"There are many man-made satellites revolving round the Earth. These are called artificial satellites. They are launched from the Earth. They revolve around the Earth much closer than Earth’s natural satellite. Artificial satellites have many practical applications. They are used for forecasting weather, transmitting television and radio signals etc. They are used for telecommunication and remote sensing."
Explain how the Earth rotates on a tilted axis.,The plane of the equator is called the equatorial plane. The plane in which the Earth revolves round the Sun is called the orbital plane of the Earth. These two planes are inclined to each other at an angle of 23.5°. This means that the axis of the Earth is inclined to its orbital plane at an angle of 66.5°. North Earth’s orbital plane South Fig. : Earth rotates on a tilted axis
What is waxing and vaning of moon ?,"Different phases of moon are visible from the Earth. This change in shapes occurs due to variation in sunlight reflected by moon from its surface. At certain times, it appears to be bright whereas at others it appears to be dark. When brightness of moon is increasing, it is called waxing, when brightness of moon is decreasing, it is called vaning."
