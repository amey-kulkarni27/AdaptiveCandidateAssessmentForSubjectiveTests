Explain and draw nitrogen cycle.,"Nitrogen cycle. Fig. Nitrogen Cycle  Our atmosphere has 78% of nitrogen gas. Certain bacteria and blue-green algae are present in soil that fix nitrogen.  They convert it into compound of Nitrogen.  These compounds can be used by plants through soil.  Plants synthesize proteins and other compounds.  Animals, feeding on plants get these.  When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi present in the soil decompose them and again convert into nitrogenous compound. Certain bacteria convert it into nitrogen gas, which goes back to the atmosphere. 5"
What do you understand by food preservation ? Explain any four methods of food preservation.,"Micro-organisms spoil our food. The process used for various purposes. They are used of keeping our food safe from micro-organism is called food preservation. Various methods of food preservation are :  Drying : It reduces the moisture of food material which prevents growth of micro organisms.  By common salt and sugar : Meat and fish are covered with dry salt to check the growth of bacteria. Sugar reduces the moisture content, which inhibits the growth of bacteria that spoils food.  By oil and vinegar : Use of oil and vinegar prevents spoilage of pickles because bacteria cannot live in such an environment.  Refrigeration and freezing : Low temperature retards this growth. Thus, it is safe for food.  By chemicals : Chemicals such as sodium benzoate and potassium metabisulphite are used in jams, squash and ketchup.  "
Write a short note on useful micro-organisms. Or Harmful micro-organisms.,"Useful micro-organisms :  Friendly micro-organism—They are in making curd  and bread.

Yeast is grown on natural sugars present in grains such as barley, wheat, rice, fruit juices for this purpose.  Medicinal use—A very useful medicine ‘antibiotics’ is prepared from micro organisms commonly-used antibiotics MICRO-ORGANISMS : FRIEND AND FOE are formed by fungi and bacteria. Vaccine also protects it from microbes.  Increasing soil fertility—Some bacteria and blue-green algae are able to fix nitrogen from atmosphere and form nitrogen compounds which increase the soil fertility.  Decomposers—They decompose the dead organic substances into their constituents and clean the environment.  Or Harmful micro organism  Pathogens—Disease causing microorganism is called pathogens. Diseases such as dysentery and malaria are caused by protozoa. Typhoid and tuberculosis are bacterial diseases. Virus shows common aliments such as cold, influenza and most coughs.  Food spoilage—Some micro-organisms spoil food, clothing and leather. Fungus developed in moisture on leather and some food articles and spoil them."
