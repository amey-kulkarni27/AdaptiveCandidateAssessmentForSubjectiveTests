Write the chemical reaction that shows rusting of iron.,Iron  + Oxygen  + Water   Fe2O3.xH2O Hydrated Iron oxide 
What happens when magnesium ribbon is burnt in air ? How will you test for its acidic / basic nature ?,"A white coloured ash of magnesium oxide is obtained on burning magnesium ribbon. When white ash  is dissolved on testing, it turns red litmus paper to blue. Hence, it is basic in nature. 2Mg + O2  2MgO."
Complete the following chemical reactions. Sulphur dioxide  + Water   ? Is it a acid/base ?,SO2+ H2O  H2SO3. Sulphurous acid. It is an acid.
Why is sodium stored in kerosene ?,"Sodium metal is very reactive. It reacts vigorously with oxygen and water. A lot of heat is generated in the reaction. It is, therefore, stored in kerosene."
Why is phosphorus stored in water ?,"Phosphorus is a very reactive non-metal. It catches fire if exposed to air. To prevent contact of phosphorus with atmospheric oxygen, it is stored in water."
Drop a piece of aluminium in freshly prepared solution of sodium hydroxide. Bring a matchstick near the mouth of testtube. A pop sound appears.  What does this pop-up sound indicate ?  What do you conclude from this reaction ?, This ‘pop’ sound indicates the presence of hydrogen gas.  We conclude that metal reacts with sodium hydroxide to produce hydrogen gas.
Write the different uses of metals.,"Metals are used in making machinery, automobiles, aeroplane, trains, satellites, industrial gadgets, cooking utensils, water boilers etc."
Copper sulphate  + Zinc   Zinc sulphate  + Copper    — What is this reaction is called ? — Is it a reversible chemical reaction why ? Why not ?,This reaction is called displacement reaction. It is not a reversible reaction because copper is less reactive metal than zinc. It is unable to replace zinc from zinc sulphate salt.
Why aluminium foils are used to wrap food items ? ,"Aluminium can be converted into thin sheets that can be folded into any shape. Further, it is available at affordable cost."
Write characteristics of metals. Write characteristics of non-metals.,Characteristics of Metals :  Metals can be hammered into sheets .  Metals can be drawn into wires .  Metals give ringing sound .  Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity. Or Characteristics of non-metal :  Non-metals are brittle.  They can be broken into pieces on heating. .  Non-metals are poor conductors of heat and electricity.  They are non-sonorous. 
What happens when a copper vessel is exposed to moist air for long ? ,"When a copper vessel is exposed to moist air for long, it acquires a dull green coating. The green material is a mixture of copper hydroxide ) and copper carbonate . Following is the reaction : 2Cu + H2O + CO2 + O2  Moist air Cu2 + CuCO3  Green colour"
Write an activity to test whether sulphur solution is acidic or basic in nature.,"Activity to test that sulphur solution is acidic or basic in nature :  Take a small amount of powdered sulphur in a deflagrating spoon and heat it.  As sulphur starts burning introduce it into a gas jar.  Cover the gas jar so that gas produced does not escape.  Remove spoon after sometime, add a small quantity of water.  Shake it well. Sulphur solution is ready.  Test it with red and blue litmus papers.  It turns blue litmus paper red. Hence it is acidic in nature."
What do you understand by displace-ment reactions ? What happens when copper sulphate reacts with zinc ? Explain this reaction also.,"When a more reactive element replaces a less reactive element or molecule from its salt, such reactions are called displacement reactions. These reactions can be well explained in metals. When in copper sulphate solution zinc granules are added, the blue colour of copper sulphate disappears and a powdery red mass of copper is deposited at the bottom of the beaker. The reaction can be represented as follows : CuSO4 + Zn  ZnSO4 + Cu    Red cupper CuSO 4  CuSO4 Zinc granules Colourless Zinc sulphate solutions"
Write three important uses of non-metals.,Important uses of non-metals.  Non-metals are essential for our life as all living beings inhale Oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide during breathing.  They are used in fertilizers to enhance the growth of plants.  Non-metal is used in the purple coloured solution that is applied on wounds as an antiseptic.  Non-metals are used in crackers. 
How are acids and bases formed ?,"Acids—Acids are formed when non-metals react with oxygen and form non-metallic oxides. These oxides when dissolved in water, form acids, e.g., O2  SO2   (Sulphur dioxide) SO2 + H2O  H2SO3 (Sulphur  (Sulphurous dioxide) acid) Bases—Bases are formed when metals react with oxygen and form metallic oxides. These oxides when dissolved in water, form bases, e.g., 2Na + O2  Na2O    Na2O + H2O  2NaOH  (Sodium oxide) hydroxide)"
Discuss all the physical properties of metals.,Physical Properties of Metals :  Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity.  Metals are malleable and ductile.  They are lustrous and can be polished.  Generally they are solid at room temperature except mercury.  Metals generally have high melting and boiling points. 
What happens when :   Dilute sulphuric acid is poured on a copper plate ?  Iron nails are placed in copper sulphate solution ? Write word equation of the reaction involved.," When dilute sulphuric acid is poured on a copper plate, copper reacts with acid to give copper sulphate and hydrogen. Sulphuric acid + Copper    Copper sulphate  +  Hydrogen 1½  When iron nails are placed in copper sulphate solution, displacement reaction takes place in which iron displaces copper. CuSO4 Fe Copper sulphate Iron FeSO4 + Cu Iron sulphate Copper MATERIALS : METALS AND NON-METALS"
Take a piece of burning charcoal and collect the gas evolved in a test-tube.   Find the nature of gas.  Write down word equations of all the reactions taking place in this process.," Charcoal produces carbon dioxide on burning. This gas turns lime water milky and its solution turns blue litmus to red. Hence, it is acidic.  Carbon + Oxygen  Carbon dioxide. CO2 O2  Carbon dioxide lime water Milky solution."
What happens when gold jewellery is washed in acidic solution ? ,Gold jewelleries washed in acidic solution. In this process certain amount of gold is lost in the acidic solution as some gold is dissolved in acid to form oxide. This causes the loss of gold in the form of gold oxide.
 Why does an aluminium vessel lose its shining soon after use ?  Can we store lemon pickle in an aluminium utensil ? Explain.," Aluminium is a reactive metal. As it comes in contact with air, it forms a dull layer of aluminium oxide on its surface and hence loses its shine.  No, we cannot store the lemon pickle in aluminium utensils because aluminium is a metal and lemon is acid. The acid reacts with metals to give hydrogen which would spoil the food and make it unfit to use."
