Keeping in view the above statement, answer the following questions :  What are the 4R by which we can make a difference in our environment ?  How can you contribute at your own level to save the environment ?","Ans.  As a responsible citizen we must remember the 4R principle. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Recover. Development of these habits is environment friendly. Reduce the use of  plastic as it is a non-biodegradable substance. Reuse such plastic which get deformed easily on heating and can be reshaped in any form. Recycling also reduces the cost of articles and saves resources.  I can contribute at my own level to save the environment as follows : — I will not throw plastic bags in the water bodies or on the road. — I will take a cotton bag or a jute bag while going for shopping. — I will try to minimize the use of plastic materials e.g., use a steel lunch box instead of a plastic one."
