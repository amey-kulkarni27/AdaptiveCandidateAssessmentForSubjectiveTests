Draw a labelled diagram of unicellular organism.,Unicellular animal—Amoeba Pseudopodia Vacoule
How does an organism begins its life ?,An organism with billions of cells begins life as a single cell which is the fertilized egg. This fertilized egg cell multiplies and the number of cells increases as development proceeds.
How does amoeba capture the food ?,Amoeba captures the food by producing the projections of varying lengths. These are called pseudopodia .
What are the shapes of cells ? CELL-STRUCTUERE AND FUNCTIONS,"Generally, cells are round, spherical or elongated. Some cells are long and pointed at both the ends. They exhibit a spindle shape. Sometimes they are quite long and branched like nerve cell."
Write the size of the smallest and largest cell.,"The smallest cell is 0.1 to 0.5 micrometre in bacteria. The largest cell measuring 170 mm × 130 mm, is the egg of an Ostrich."
Define tissue.,A tissue is a group of similar cells performing a specific function. Tissues together make an organ.
Describe the structure of hen’s egg.,In hen’s egg a white material surrounds the yellow part. White material is albumin and yellow part is yolk. They are part of a single cell.
What is plasma membrane ? What are its characteristics ?,"The cytoplasm and nucleus are enclosed within the cell membrane, also called plasma membrane. The membrane separates cells from one another and also cells from the surrounding medium. It is porous and allows the movement of substances or materials both inwards and outwards."
Why plant cell needs cell wall ?,"There is an outer thick layer in cells of plants called cell wall. It is required by plant for protection. Plants cells need protection against variations in temperature, high wind speed, atmospheric moisture etc."
What is cytoplasm ?,"Cytoplasm is a jelly like substance present between the cell membrane and the nucleus. Various components, or organelles are present in the cytoplasm. These are mitochondria, golgi bodies, ribosomes etc."
Draw Red blood cell and nerve cell.,Fig. Red Blood Cells movement of material between the cytoplasm and nucleus. It has a small spherical body inside it called nucleolus. It contains small thread like structures called chromosomes. They carry genes and help in transferring of characters from parents to offsprings.
Differentiate between :  Prokaryotic and eukaryotic  Animal cell and plant cell.,"Differentiate Between Eukaryotic  Prokaryotic Cell Cell The cells having nuclear material without nuclear membrane. Organisms termed Prokaryotes e.g., Blue, green algae. Fig. Nerve cells"
What is nucleus ? Describe it.,"Nucleus is an important component of the living cell. It is generally spherical and located in the centre of the cell. It is separated from the cytoplasm by a membrane called nuclear membrane. It is also porous and allows the The cells having wellorganised nucleus with nuclear membrane. Organism termed Eukaryotes e.g.,Onion cell, cheek cells.  Animal Cell Plant Cell Cell wall present.  Cell wall absent.  Vacuoles are small in A large vacuole presize. sent in the centre of cell."
