They do not seem to understand the scientific reason behind the birth of a boy or a girl. In your opinion, the approach of the society towards mother in this regard is correct or not ?","Ans. In rural and uneducated families till today in India female foeticide is a common practice. The females are blamed forgiving birth to a female or girl child. But as per truth and scientific reason the sex of the child is determined by the male as they have XY chromosomes and female body have XX chromosome. If male produces X chromosome the born child will be female and if they produce Y chromosome male child will be born. Hence, we must educate the citizens regarding this through lectures, campaigns etc."
