Explain reproductive phase of life in humans.,"Reproductive phase of life in humans : Adolescents become capable of reproduction when their testes and ovaries begin to produce gametes. The hormone testosterone in male is secreted by testes. In female, the reproductive phase begins at puberty–10 to 12 yrs to 45-50 yrs. The ovum matures and is released by one of the ovaries once in 28 to 30 days. During this period, the wall of the uterus becomes thick. If it is fertilized, it results in pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the eggs and the thickened lining of the uterus along with blood vessels is sheded off. This cause menstruation. Sex is also determined by the sex hormones X and Y. Male have ‘XY’ chromosomes and female have ‘XX’ chromosome in their body. The baby child will be male if the sper m contributes ‘Y’ chromosome and child will be female if the sperm releases ‘X’ chromosomes. Hence, males are responsible for sex determination in humans."
