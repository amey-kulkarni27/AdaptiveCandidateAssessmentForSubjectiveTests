CROP PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT

P

aheli and Boojho went to their
uncle’s house during the summer
vacation. Their uncle is a farmer.
One day they saw some tools like khurpi,
sickle, shovel, plough, etc., in the field.

In order to provide food for a large
population— regular production, proper
management and distribution is
necessary.

I want to know
where and how we
use these tools.

You have learnt that all living
organisms require food. Plants can make
their food themselves. Can you recall
how green plants synthesise their own
food? Animals including humans can
not make their own food. So, where do
animals get their food from?
But, first of all why do we have to eat
food?
You already know that energy from
the food is utilised by organisms for
carrying out their various body
functions, such as digestion, respiration
and excretion. We get our food from
plants, or animals, or both.

Since we all need food,
how can we provide
food to a large number
of people in our
country?

Food has to be
produced on a large
scale.

1.1 Agricultural Practices
T ill 10,000 B.C.E. people were
nomadic. They were wandering in
groups from place to place in search
of food and shelter. They ate raw
fruits and vegetables and started
hunting animals for food. Later, they
could cultivate land and produce rice,
wheat and other food crops. Thus,
was born ‘Agriculture’.

When plants of the same kind are
cultivated at one place on a large scale,
it is called a crop. For example, crop of
wheat means that all the plants grown
in a field are that of wheat.
You already know that crops are of
different types like cereals, vegetables
and fruits. These can be classified on the
basis of the season in which they grow.
India is a vast country. The climatic
conditions like temperature, humidity
and rainfall vary from one region to
another. Accordingly, there is a rich

2021–22

variety of crops grown in different parts
of the country. Despite this diversity,
two broad cropping patterns can be
identified. These are:
(i) Kharif Crops : The crops which are
sown in the rainy season are called
kharif crops. The rainy season in India
is generally from June to September.
Paddy, maize, soyabean, groundnut and
cotton are kharif crops.
(ii) Rabi Crops : The crops grown in the
winter season (October to March) are
called rabi crops. Examples of rabi
crops are wheat, gram, pea, mustard
and linseed.
Besides these, pulses and vegetables
are grown during summer at many
places.

1.2 Basic Practices of Crop
Production

Why paddy can not be
grown in the winter season?

Paddy requires a lot of
water. Therefore, it is grown
only in the rainy season.

Cultivation of crops involves several
activities undertaken by farmers over a
period of time. You may find that these
activities are similar to those carried out
by a gardener or even by you when you
grow ornamental plants in your house.
These activities or tasks are referred

to as agricultural practices which are
listed below:

Irrigation

1.3 Preparation of Soil
The preparation of soil is the first step
before growing a crop. One of the most
important tasks in agriculture is to turn
the soil and loosen it. This allows the
roots to penetrate deep into the soil. The
loose soil allows the roots to breathe
easily even when they go deep into the
soil. Why does the loosening of soil allow
the roots to breathe easily?
The loosened soil helps in the growth
of earthworms and microbes present in
the soil. These organisms are friends of
the farmer since they further turn and
loosen the soil and add humus to it.
But why the soil needs to be turned and
loosened?
You have learnt in the previous
classes that soil contains minerals,
water, air and some living organisms.
In addition, dead plants and animals
get decomposed by soil organisms. In
this way, various nutrients in the dead
organisms are released back into the
soil. These nutrients are again absorbed
by plants.
Since only a few centimetres of the
top layer of soil supports plant growth,
turning and loosening of soil brings the
nutrient-rich soil to the top so that
plants can use these nutrients. Thus,

2

SCIENCE

2021–22

turning and loosening of soil is very
important for cultivation of crops.
The process of loosening and turning
of the soil is called tilling or ploughing.
This is done by using a plough. Ploughs
are made of wood or iron. If the soil is
very dry, it may need watering before
ploughing. The ploughed field may have
big clumps of soil called crumbs. It is
necessary to break these crumbs.
Levelling the field is beneficial for
sowing as well as for irrigation. Levelling
of soil is done with the help of a leveller.
Sometimes, manure is added to the
soil before tilling. This helps in proper
mixing of manure with soil. The soil is
moistened before sowing.
Agricultural Implements
Before sowing the seeds, it is necessary to
break soil clumps to get better yield. This
is done with the help of various tools.
The main tools used for this purpose are
the plough, hoe and cultivator.

Plough : This is being used since
ancient times for tilling the soil, adding
fertilisers to the crop, removing the weeds
and turning the soil. This is made of
wood and is drawn by a pair of bulls or
other animals (horses and camels). It
contains a strong triangular iron strip
called ploughshare. The main part of the
plough is a long log of wood which is
called a ploughshaft. There is a handle
at one end of the shaft. The other end is
attached to a beam which is placed on
the bulls’ necks. One pair of bulls and a
man can easily operate the plough
[Fig. 1.1 (a)].
The indigenous wooden plough is
increasingly being replaced by iron
ploughs nowadays.
Hoe : It is a simple tool which is used
for removing weeds and for loosening
the soil. It has a long rod of wood or
iron. A strong, broad and bent plate of
iron is fixed to one of its ends and

Cultivator : Nowadays ploughing is
done by tractor-driven cultivator. The
use of cultivator saves labour and time.
[Fig. 1.1 (c)].

1.4 Sowing
Sowing is an important part of crop
production. Before sowing, good quality,
clean and healthy seeds of a good
variety—are selected. Farmers prefer to
use seeds which give high yield.

Are there seeds which float on
water? Would those be lighter or
heavier than those which sink? Why
would they be lighter? Damaged seeds
become hollow and are thus lighter.
Therefore, they float on water.
This is a good method for
separating good, healthy seeds from
the damaged ones.
Before sowing, one of the important
tasks is to know about the tools used
for sowing seeds [Fig. 1.2 (a), (b)].
Traditional tool : The tool used
traditionally for sowing seeds is
shaped like a funnel [Fig. 1.2 (a)]. The
seeds are filled into the funnel,
passed down through two or three
pipes having sharp ends. These
ends pierce into the soil and place
seeds there.

Selection of Seeds

One day I saw my mother put
some gram seeds in a vessel
and pour some water on
them. After a few minutes
some seeds started to float
on top. I wonder why some
seeds float on water!

sufficient sunlight, nutrients and water
from the soil. At times a few plants
may have to be removed to prevent
overcrowding.

1.5 Adding Manure and
Fertilisers
The substances which are added to the
soil in the form of nutrients for the
healthy growth of plants are called
manure and fertilisers.
Fig. 1.2 (b) : A seed drill

Seed drill : Nowadays the seed drill [Fig.
1.2 (b)] is used for sowing with the help
of tractors. This sows the seeds
uniformly at equal distance and depth.
It ensures that seeds get covered by the
soil after sowing. This protects seeds
from being eaten by birds. Sowing by
using a seed drill saves time and labour.

There is a nursery near my
school. I found that little
plants were kept in small
bags. Why are they
kept like this?

Seeds of a few plants
such as paddy are first
grown in a nursery. When
they grow into seedlings,
they are transplanted to
the field manually. Some
forest plants and flowering
plants are also grown in
the nursery.

Appropriate distance between the
seeds is necessary to avoid overcrowding
of plants. This allows plants to get

I saw a healthy crop growing
in a farm. In the neighbouring
farm, the plants were weak.
Why do some plants grow
better than others?

Soil supplies mineral nutrients to the
crop plants. These nutrients are
essential for the growth of plants. In
certain areas, farmers grow crop after
crop in the same field. The field is never
left uncultivated or fallow. Imagine what
happens to the nutrients?
Continuous cultivation of crops
makes the soil poor in nutrients.
Therefore, farmers have to add manure
to the fields to replenish the soil with
nutrients. This process is called
manuring. Improper or insufficient
manuring results in weak plants.
Manure is an organic substance
obtained from the decomposition of
plant or animal wastes. Farmers dump
plant and animal waste in pits at open
places and allow it to decompose. The
decomposition is caused by some
microorganisms. The decomposed
matter is used as organic manure.
You have alr eady learnt about
vermicomposting in Class VI.

Activity 1.2
Take moong or gram seeds and
germinate them. Select three equal
sized seedlings. Take three empty
glasses or similar vessels. Mark them
A, B and C. To glass A add little
amount of soil mixed with a little cow
dung manure. In glass B put the
same amount of soil mixed with a
little urea. Take the same amount
of soil in glass C without adding
anything [Fig. 1.3(a)]. Now pour the
same amount of water in each glass
and plant the seedlings in them.
Keep them in a safe place and water
them daily. After 7 to 10 days
observe their growth [Fig. 1.3(b)].

Fig. 1.3 (a) : Preparation of the experiment

Fig. 1.3 (b) : Growing seedlings with manure
and fertiliser

Did plants in all the glasses grow at
the same pace? Which glass showed

better growth of plants? In which glass
was the growth fastest?
Fertilisers are chemicals which are
rich in a particular nutrient. How are
they different from manure? Fertilisers
are produced in factories. Some
examples of fertilisers are— urea,
ammonium
sulphate,
super
phosphate, potash, NPK (Nitrogen,
Phosphorus, Potassium).
The use of fertilisers has helped
farmers to get better yield of crops
such as wheat, paddy and maize. But
excessive use of fertilisers has made
the soil less fertile. Fertilisers have also
become a source of water pollution.
Therefore, in order to maintain the
fertility of the soil, we have to
substitute fertilisers with organic
manure or leave the field uncultivated
(fallow) in between two crops.
The use of manure improves soil
texture as well as its water retaining
capacity. It replenishes the soil with
nutrients.
Another method of replenishing
the soil with nutrients is through crop
rotation. This can be done by growing
different crops alternately. Earlier,
farmers in northern India used to
grow legumes as fodder in one season
and wheat in the next season. This
helped in the replenishment of the soil
with nitrogen. Farmers are being
encouraged to adopt this practice.
In the previous classes, you have
learnt about Rhizobium bacteria.
These are present in the nodules of
roots of leguminous plants. They fix
atmospheric nitrogen.

1.

Fertiliser is a man-made
inorganic salt.

Manure is a natural substance obtained
by the decomposition of cattle dung
and plant residues.

2.

Fertiliser is prepared in
factories.

Manure can be prepared in the fields.

3.

Fertiliser does not provide
any humus to the soil.

Manure provides a lot of humus to the soil.

4.

Fertilisers are very rich in
plant nutrients like nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium.

Manure is relatively less rich in plant
nutrients.

Table 1.1 gives the differences
between a fertiliser and manure.
Advantages of Manure : The organic
manure is considered better than
fertilisers. This is because
l

it enhances the water holding
capacity of the soil.
it makes the soil porous due to which
exchange of gases becomes easy.
it increases the number of friendly
microbes.
it improves the texture of the soil.

1.6 Irrigation
All living beings need water to live.
Water is important for proper growth
and development. Water is absorbed by
the plant roots. Along with water,
minerals and fertilisers are also
absorbed. Plants contain nearly 90%
water. Water is essential because
germination of seeds does not take place
under dry conditions. Nutrients
dissolved in water are transported to
each part of the plant. Water also

protects the crop from both frost and
hot air currents. To maintain the
moisture of the soil for healthy crop
growth, fields have to be watered
regularly.
The supply of water to crops at
regular intervals is called irrigation. The
time and frequency of irrigation varies
from crop to crop, soil to soil and season
to season. In summer, the frequency of
watering is higher. Why is it so? Could
it be due to the increased rate of
evaporation of water from the soil and
the leaves?
I am very careful this
year about watering
the plants. Last
summer my plants
dried up and died.

Sources of irrigation : The sources of
water for irrigation are— wells,
tubewells, ponds, lakes, rivers, dams
and canals.

Traditional Methods of
Irrigation
The water available in wells,
lakes and canals is lifted up
by different methods in
different regions, for taking it
to the fields.
Cattle or human labour is
used in these methods. So
these methods are cheaper,
but less efficient. The various
traditional ways are:
(i) moat (pulley -system)
(ii) chain pump

used for lifting water. Diesel,
biogas, electricity and
solar energy is used to run
these pumps.

Modern Methods of
Irrigation
Modern methods of irrigation
help us to use water
economically. The main
methods used are as follows:
(i) Sprinkler System: This
system is more useful on the
uneven land where sufficient
water is not available. The
perpendicular pipes, having
rotating nozzles on top, are
joined to the main pipeline
at regular intervals. When
water is allowed to flow
through the main pipe under pressure
with the help of a pump, it escapes from
the rotating nozzles. It gets sprinkled
on the crop as if it is raining.
Sprinkler is very useful for lawns, coffee
plantation and several other crops
[Fig. 1.5 (a)].

Fig. 1.5 (a) : Sprinkler system

(ii) Drip system : In this system, the
water falls drop by drop directly near
the roots. So it is called drip system. It
is the best technique for watering fruit
plants, gardens and trees [Fig. 1.5(b)].
Water is not wasted at all. It is a boon in
regions where availability of water is poor.

1.7 Protection from Weeds
Boojho and Paheli went to a nearby
wheat field and saw that there were some
other plants in the field, growing along
with wheat plants.
Have these other
plants been planted
purposely?

In a field many other undesirable
plants may grow naturally along with
the crop. These undesirable plants are
called weeds.
The removal of weeds is called
weeding. Weeding is necessary since
weeds compete with the crop plants for
water, nutrients, space and light. Thus,
they affect the growth of the crop. Some
weeds interfere even in harvesting and
may be poisonous for animals and
human beings.
Farmers adopt many ways to remove
weeds and control their growth. Tilling
before sowing of crops helps in
uprooting and killing of weeds, which
may then dry up and get mixed with
the soil. The best time for the removal
of weeds is before they produce flowers
and seeds. The manual removal includes
physical removal of weeds by uprooting
or cutting them close to the ground,
from time to time. This is done with the
help of a khurpi. A seed drill [Fig. 1.2(b)]
is also used to uproot weeds.
Weeds are also controlled by using
certain chemicals, called weedicides,
like 2,4-D. These are sprayed in the
fields to kill the weeds. They do not
damage the crops. The weedicides are
diluted with water to the extent required
and sprayed in the fields with a sprayer.
(Fig. 1.6).

Fig. 1.6 : Spraying weedicide

Do weedicides have any
effect on the person handling
the weedicide sprayer?

As already mentioned, the weedicides
are sprayed during the vegetative growth
of weeds before flowering and seed
formation. Spraying of weedicides may
affect the health of farmers. So they
should use these chemicals very carefully.
They should cover their nose and mouth
with a piece of cloth during spraying of
these chemicals.

1.8 Harvesting
Harvesting of a crop is an important
task. The cutting of crop after it is
mature is called harvesting. In
harvesting, crops are pulled out or cut
close to the ground. It usually takes 3
to 4 months for a cereal crop to mature.
Harvesting in our
country is either done
manually
by
sickle
(Fig. 1.7) or by a machine
called harvester. In the
harvested crop, the grain Fig. 1.7 :
seeds need to be separated
Sickle

10

SCIENCE

from the chaff. This process is called
threshing. This is carried out with the
help of a machine called ‘combine’ which
is in fact a harvester as well as a thresher
(Fig. 1.8).

Harvest Festivals
After three or four months of hard
work there comes the day of the
harvest. The sight of golden fields
of standing crop, laden with grain,
fills the hearts of farmers with joy
a n d a s e n s e o f w e l l -b e i n g . T h e
efforts of the past season have
borne fruit and it is time to relax
and enjoy a little. The period of
harvest is, thus, of great joy and
happiness in all parts of India.
Men and women celebrate it with
great
enthusiasm.
Special
festivals associated with the
h a r v e s t s e a s o n are P o n g a l ,
Baisakhi, Holi, Diwali, Nabanya
and Bihu.

Fig. 1.8 : Combine

1.9 Storage
After harvesting, sometimes
stubs are left in the field, which
are burnt by farmers. Paheli is
worried. She knows that it
causes pollution. It may also
catch fire and damage the crops
lying in the fields.

Farmers with small holdings of land
do the separation of grain and chaff by
winnowing (Fig. 1.9). You have already
studied this in Class VI.

Storage of produce is an important task.
If the harvested grains are to be kept
for longer time, they should be safe
from moisture, insects, rats and
microorganisms. Harvested grains have
more moisture. If freshly harvested
grains (seeds) are stored without drying,
they may get spoilt or attacked by
organisms, making them unfit for use
or for germination. Hence, before
storing them, the grains are properly
dried in the sun to reduce the moisture
in them. This prevents the attack by
insect pests, bacteria and fungi.

I saw my mother putting
some dried neem leaves
in an iron drum
containing wheat.
I wonder why?

Farmers store grains in jute bags or
metallic bins. However, large scale
storage of grains is done in silos and
granaries to protect them from pests
like rats and insects [Fig. 1.10 (a)
and (b)].
Dried neem leaves are used for
storing food grains at home. For storing
large quantities of grains in big
godowns, specific chemical treatments
are required to protect them from pests
and microorganisms.

After completing this Table, you
must have seen that, like plants,
animals also provide us with different
kinds of food. Many people living in the
coastal areas consume fish as a major
part of their diet. In the previous classes
you have learnt about the food that we
obtain from plants. We have just seen
that the process of crop production
involves a number of steps like selection
of seeds, sowing, etc. Similarly, animals
reared at home or in farms, have to be
provided with proper food, shelter and
care. When this is done on a large scale,
it is called animal husbandry.

Fish is good for health.
We get cod liver oil from fish

An Example for Field Trip Work
Himanshu and his friends were very anxious and curious to go to Thikri village.
They went to Shri Jiwan Patel’s farmhouse. They had taken bags to collect some
seeds and other things.
Himanshu :

Sir namaskar, I am Himanshu. Here are my friends Mohan, David
and Sabiha. We want some information about crops. Please guide
us.

Shri Patel :

Namaskar and welcome all of you. What are your queries?

Sabiha :

When did you start this work and what are the main crops that
you grow?

Shri Patel :

About 75 years ago, my grandfather started this work. The main
crops that we grow are wheat, gram, soyabean and moong.

David :

Sir, can you tell us the difference between traditional and modern
agricultural practices?

Shri Patel :

Earlier we used traditional tools like sickle, bullock plough, trowel,
etc., and depended on rain water for irrigation. But now we use
modern methods of irrigation. We use implements like tractors,
cultivators, seed drill and harvester. We get good quality seeds.
We carry out soil testing and use manure and fertilisers. New
information about agriculture is obtained through radio, T.V. and
other sources. As a result we are able to get good crops on a large
scale. This year we got 9 to 11 quintals of gram crop/acre and 20
to 25 quintals of wheat/acre. In my opinion awareness of new
technology is important for better crop yield.

Mohan :

Sabiha, come here and see some earthworms. Are they helpful to
the farmers?

Sabiha :

Oh Mohan! we learnt about it in Class VI.

David :

Earthworms turn the soil and loosen it for proper aeration, so
