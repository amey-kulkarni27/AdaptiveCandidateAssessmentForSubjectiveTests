SYNTHETIC FIBRES AND PLASTICS

T

he clothes which we wear are
made of fabrics. Fabrics
are made from fibres obtained
from natural or artificial sources. Can
you name some natural fibres? Fibres
are also used for making a large variety
of household articles. Make a list of some
common articles made from fibres. Try
to separate them into those made from
natural fibres and those made from
artificial fibres. Make entries in Table 3.1.

3.1 What are Synthetic
Fibres?
Try to recall the uniform pattern found
in a necklace of beads joined with the
help of a thread [Fig. 3.1(a)]. Or, try to
join a number of paper clips together to
make a long chain, as in Fig. 3.1 (b). Is
there any similarity between the two?

Why did you label some fibres as
artificial?
You have read in your previous
classes that natural fibres like cotton,
wool, silk, etc., are obtained from plants
or animals. The synthetic fibres, on the
other hand, are made by human beings.
That is why these are called synthetic
or man-made fibres.

A synthetic fibre is also a chain of
small units joined together. Each small
unit is actually a chemical substance.
Many such small units combine to form
a large single unit called a polymer. The
word ‘polymer’ comes from two Greek
words; poly meaning many and mer
meaning part/unit. So, a polymer is made
of many repeating units.

2021–22

Nylon

Polymers occur in nature also. Cotton,
for example, is a polymer called
cellulose. Cellulose is made up of a
large number of glucose units.

3.2 Types of Synthetic Fibres
Rayon
You have read in Class VII that silk fibre
obtained from silkworm was discovered
in China and was kept as a closely
guarded secret for a long time. Fabric
obtained from silk fibre was very costly.
But its beautiful texture fascinated
everybody. Attempts were made to make
silk artificially. Towards the end of the
nineteenth century, scientists were
successful in obtaining a fibre having
properties similar to that of silk. Such a
fibre was obtained by chemical
treatment of wood pulp. This fibre was
called rayon or artificial silk. Although
rayon is obtained from a natural source,
wood pulp, yet it is a man-made fibre. It
is cheaper than silk and can be woven
like silk fibres. It can also be dyed in a
wide variety of colours. Rayon is mixed
with cotton to make bed sheets or mixed
with wool to make carpets. (Fig. 3.2.)

Nylon is another man-made fibre. In
1931, it was made without using any
natural raw material (from plant or
animal). It was prepared from coal, water
and air. It was the first fully synthetic
fibre.
Nylon fibre was strong, elastic and
light. It was lustrous and easy to wash.
So, it became very popular for making
clothes.
We use many articles made from
nylon, such as socks, ropes, tents,
toothbrushes, car seat belts, sleeping
bags, curtains, etc. (Fig. 3.3). Nylon is

a pan so that weight can be placed
in it. Add weight one by one till the
thread breaks. Note down the total
weight required to break the thread.
This weight indicates the strength
of the fibre. Repeat the same activity
with threads of wool, polyester, silk
and nylon. Tabulate the data as
shown in Table 3.2. Arrange the
threads in order of their increasing
strength.

You may use a hook or a nail on

In place of weights you may
use marbles (or pebbles) of
similar size.
(Precaution : Note that all threads
should be of the same length and
almost of the same thickness.)
Polyester and Acrylic

Polyester is another synthetic fibre.
Fabric made from this fibre does not get
wrinkled easily. It remains crisp and is
easy to wash. So, it is quite suitable for
making dress material. You must have
seen people wearing polyester shirts and
other dresses. Terylene is a popular
polyester. It can be drawn into very fine

fibres that can be woven like any
other yarn.

My mother always
buys PET bottles and
PET jars for storing
rice and sugar. I
wonder what PET is !

PET (polyethylene terephthalate) is
a very familiar form of polyester. It is
used for making bottles, utensils, films,
wires and many other useful products.
Look around and make a list of
things made of polyester.

You have already perfor med an
activity of burning natural and
synthetic fibres (Activity 3.6 of Class
VII). What did you observe? When you
burn synthetic fibres you find that
their behaviour is different from
that of the natural fibres. You must
have noticed that synthetic fibres
melt on heating. This is actually a
disadvantage of synthetic fibres. If the
clothes catch fire, it can be disastrous.
The fabric melts and sticks to the body
of the person wearing it. We should,
therefore, not wear synthetic clothes
while working in in the kitchen or in
a laboratory.

Polyester (Poly+ester) is actually made
up of the repeating units of a chemical
called an ester. Esters are the
chemicals which give fruits their smell.
Fabrics are sold by names like polycot,
polywool, terrycot, etc. As the name
suggests, these are made by mixing two
types of fibres. Polycot is a mixture of
polyester and cotton. Polywool is a
mixture of polyester and wool.

Oh! Now I understand why
my mother never wears
polyester clothes while
working in the kitchen.

We wear sweaters and use shawls
or blankets in the winter. Many of these
are actually not made from natural
wool, though they appear to resemble
wool. These are prepared from another
type of synthetic fibre called acrylic.
T h e w o ol obtai n ed from na tur a l
sources is quite expensive, whereas
clothes made from acrylic are relatively
cheap. They are available in a variety
of colours. Synthetic fibres are
more durable and affordable which
makes them more popular than
natural fibres.

All the synthetic fibres are prepared
by a number of processes using raw
materials of petroleum origin, called
petrochemicals.

3.3 Characteristics of
Synthetic Fibres
Imagine that it is a rainy day. What kind
of umbrella would you use and why?
Synthetic fibres possess unique
characteristics which make them
popular dress materials. They dry up
quickly, are durable, less expensive,
readily available and easy to maintain.
Perform the following activity and learn
for yourself.
35

Plastic is also a polymer like the
synthetic fibre. All plastics do not
have the same type of arrangement of
units. In some it is linear, whereas in
others it is cross-linked. (Fig. 3.6).
Plastic articles are available in all
possible shapes and sizes as you can
see in Fig. 3.7. Have you ever
wondered how this is possible? The
fact is that plastic is easily mouldable
i.e. can be shaped in any form. Plastic
can be recycled, reused, coloured,
melted, rolled into sheets or made into
wires. That is why it finds such a
variety of uses.

Activity 3.2
Take two cloth pieces of the same
size, roughly half a metre square
each. One of these should be from
natural fibre. The other could be a
synthetic fibre. You can take help
of your parents in selecting these
pieces. Soak the pieces in different
mugs each containing the same
amount of water. Take the pieces
out of the containers after five
minutes and spread them in the sun
for a few minutes. Compare the
volume of the water remaining in
each container.
Do synthetic fabrics soak less/more
water than the natural fabrics? Do they
take less/more time to dry?
What does this activity tell you about
the characteristics of the synthetic fabrics?
Find out from your parents about the
durability, cost and maintenance of these
fabrics, compared to the natural fabrics.

3.4 Plastics
You must be familiar with many plastic
articles used everyday. Make a list of
such items and their uses.

Polythene (Poly+ethene) is an example
of a plastic. It is used for making
commonly used polythene bags.

Fig. 3.6 : (a) Linear (b) Cross-linked
arrangements

Now, try to bend a piece of plastic
yourself. Can all the plastic articles be
bent easily?
You will observe that some plastic
articles can bend easily while some
break when forced to bend. When we

36

SCIENCE

2021–22

add hot water to a plastic bottle, it gets
deformed. Such plastic which
gets deformed easily on heating and
can be bent easily are known as
thermoplastics. Polythene and PVC are
some of the examples of thermoplastics.
These are used for manufacturing toys,
combs and various types of containers.
On the other hand, there are some
plastics which when moulded once, can
not be softened by heating. These are
called thermosetting plastics. Two
examples are bakelite and melamine.
Bakelite is a poor conductor of heat and
electricity. It is used for making
electrical switches, handles of various
utensils, etc. Melamine is a versatile
material. It resists fire and can tolerate
heat better than other plastics. It is used
for making floor tiles, kitchenware and
fabrics which resist fire. Fig. 3.8 shows
the various uses of thermoplastics and
thermosetting plastics.

3.5 Plastics as Materials of
Choice
Today if we think of storing a food
item, water, milk, pickles, dry food
etc., plastic containers seem most
convenient. This is because of their
light weight, lower price, good strength
and easy handling. Being lighter as
compared to metals, plastics are used
in cars, aircrafts and spacecrafts, too.
The list is endless if we start counting
articles like slippers, furniture,
decoration pieces, etc.
Now, let us discuss the characteristic
properties of plastics.
Plastic is Non-reactive
You know that metals like iron get
rusted when left exposed to moisture
and air. But plastics do not react with
water and air. They are not corroded
easily. That is why they are used to store
various kinds of material, including
many chemicals.
Plastic is Light, Strong and Durable

Talk to your parents or grandparents
about the types of buckets that were
used in the past. What is the material
of the buckets or mugs you are using
today? What are the advantages of using
a plastic container? Since plastic is very
light, strong, durable and can be
moulded into different shapes and sizes,
it is used for various purposes. Plastics
are generally cheaper than metals. They
are widely used in industry and for
household articles. Make a list of
different kinds of plastic containers that
you use in daily life.

Plastics are Poor Conductors
You have learnt above that plastics are
poor conductors of heat and electricity.
That is why electrical wires have plastic
covering, and handles of screw drivers
are made of plastic. As mentioned above,
handles of frying pans are also made
of plastic.
Did You Know?
Ü Plastics find extensive use in the
healthcare
industry.
Some
examples of their use are the
packaging of tablets, threads used
for stitching wounds, syringes,
doctors’ gloves and a number of
medical instruments.
Ü Special plastic cookware is used
in microwave ovens for cooking
food. In microwave ovens, the heat
cooks the food but does not affect
the plastic vessel.
Ü Teflon is a special plastic on which
oil and water do not stick. It is
used for non-stick coating on
cookwares.

Ü Fire-proof plastics: Although
synthetic fibre catches fire easily,
it is interesting to know that the
uniforms of firemen have coating
of melamine plastic to make them
flame resistant.

3.6 Plastics and the
Environment
When we go to the market, we usually
get things wrapped in plastic or packed
in polythene bags. That is one reason
why plastic waste keeps getting
accumulated in our homes. Ultimately,
plastic finds its way to the garbage.
Disposal of plastic is a major problem.
Why?
A material which gets decomposed
through natural processes, such
as action by bacteria, is called
biodegradable. A material which is not
easily decomposed by natural processes
is termed non-biodegradable.
Look at Table 3.3.

Since plastic takes several years to
decompose, it is not environment
friendly. It causes environmental
pollution. Besides, the burning process
in the synthetic material is quite slow
and it does not get completely burnt
easily. In the process it releases lots of
poisonous fumes into the atmosphere
causing air pollution. How can this
problem be solved?
Have you ever seen a garbage dump
where animals are eating garbage? In
the process of eating the food waste
they swallow materials like polythene
bags and wrappers of food. Can you
imagine the consequences? The
plastic material chokes the respiratory
system of these animals, or forms a
lining in their stomachs and can be
the cause of their death.
The polybags carelessly thrown here
and there are responsible for clogging
the drains, too. Sometimes we are very
careless and throw the wrappers of
chips, biscuits and other eatables on
the road or in parks or picnic places.
Should we not think twice before doing
so ? As a responsible citizen what
measures do you suggest to keep public
places clean and free of plastic?

Avoid the use of plastics as far as
possible. Make use of bags made of
cotton or jute when you go for shopping.
The
biodegradable
and
nonbiodegradable wastes should be
collected separately and disposed off
separately. Practise this in your homes.
Can you suggest some other ways in
which you can contribute towards
reducing the use of plastic materials?
It is better to recycle plastic waste.
Most of the thermoplastics can be
recycled. Make a list of items that can
be recycled. However, during recycling
certain colouring agents are added.
This limits its usage especially for
storage of food.
As a responsible citizen remember
the 5 R principle. Reduce, Reuse,
Recycle, Recover and Refuse. Develop
habits which are environment friendly.

Did You Know?
Nylon appears like silk. It is strong and flexible. These endearing qualities of
nylon created a public sensation, or nylon mania, when it was introduced in
1939. Women’s stockings made from this new fibre were in great demand. But,
unfortunately, most of the nylon production had to be diverted to making
parachutes during the Second World War (1939-1945). After the war, when
production of stockings resumed, supply did not match the demand. There was
a huge black market for this product. Women had to wait for hours in queues to
get a pair. Often there were nylon riots.
