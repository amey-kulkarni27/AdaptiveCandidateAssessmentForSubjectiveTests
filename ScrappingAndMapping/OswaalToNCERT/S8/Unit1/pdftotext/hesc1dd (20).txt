Can you name the materials which
are metals? The rest of the materials in
Table 4.1 are non-metals. Metals can be
distinguished from non-metals on the
basis of their physical and chemical
properties. Recall that lustre and
hardness are physical properties.

Change in Shape

You saw that the shape of the iron nail
and the aluminium wire changed on
beating. If they were beaten harder these
could be changed into sheets. You might
be familiar with silver foil used for
decorating sweets. You must also be
familiar with the aluminium foil used for
wrapping food. The property of metals by
which they can be beaten into thin sheets
is called malleability. This is a
characteristic property of metals. As you
must have noticed, materials like coal and
pencil lead do not show this property. Can
we call these metals?
Can you hold a hot metallic pan which
is without a plastic or a wooden handle
and not get hurt? Perhaps not! Why? Try
to list some other experiences in which a
wooden or plastic handle protects you
from being hurt while handling hot
things. On the basis of these experiences
what can you say about the conduction
of heat by wood and plastic?
You must have seen an electrician
using his screw driver. What kind of
handle does it have? Why?
Let us find out.

You observe that iron rod, nail and

Oh! The meaning of recalling
our experiences and then of
this activity was to show that
metals are good conductors of
heat and electricity. We learnt
this in Class VI.

Recall how to make an electric
circuit to test whether electricity can
pass through an object or not

Where do you find the use of
aluminium and copper wires? Have you
seen wires of coal? Definitely not!
The property of metal by which it can
be drawn into wires is called ductility.
Have you ever noticed the difference
in sound on dropping an iron sheet/
plate, a metal coin, and a piece of coal
on the floor? If not, you can try it now.
Do you note any difference in the sound
produced?

Have you seen wooden bells in
temples? Can you give a reason?
The things made of metals produce
a ringing sound when struck hard.
Suppose you have two boxes similar in
appearance, one made of wood and the
other of metal. Can you tell which box
is made of metal by striking both the
boxes?
Since metals produce ringing
sounds, they are said to be sonorous.
The materials other than metals are not
sonorous.
After performing the above activities,
we can say that some materials are hard,
lustrous, malleable, ductile, sonorous
and good conductors of heat and
electricity. The materials which
generally possess these properties are
called metals. The examples of metals
are iron, copper, aluminium, calcium,
magnesium, etc. In contrast, materials
like coal and sulphur are soft and dull
in appearance. They break down into a
powdery mass on tapping with a
hammer. They are not sonorous and are
poor conductors of heat and electricity.
These materials are called non-metals.
The examples of non-metals are sulphur,
carbon, oxygen, phosphorus, etc.

which rust is formed. You had also
performed in Class VII an activity of
burning a magnesium ribbon in air. You
had learnt that in both the processes
oxide formation takes place. Complete
the following reactions of iron and
magnesium with oxygen.
Iron (Fe) + Oxygen (O2) + Water (H2O) → ?
Magnesium (Mg) + Oxygen (O2) → ?

Activity 4.3
Let us check the nature of rust
formed as a result of the reaction
between iron, oxygen and water.
Collect a spoonful of rust and
dissolve it in a very little amount of
water. You will find that the rust
remains suspended in water. Shake
the suspension well. Test the
solution with red and blue litmus
papers (Fig. 4.3). What do you
observe? Is the solution acidic or
basic?

As soon as sulphur starts burning,
introduce the spoon into a gas jar/
glass tumbler [Fig. 4.4 (a)]. Cover the
tumbler with a lid to ensure that
the gas produced does not escape.
Remove the spoon after some time.
Add a small quantity of water into
the tumbler and quickly replace the
lid. Shake the tumbler well. Check
the solution with red and blue
litmus papers [Fig. 4.4 (b)].

Does copper also get
rusted? I have seen
a greenish deposit
on the surface of
copper vessels.
When a copper vessel is exposed to
moist air for long, it acquires a dull
green coating. The green material is
a mixture of copper hydroxide
(Cu(OH) 2 ) and copper carbonate
(CuCO3). The following is the reaction
2Cu+H2O+CO2+O2→Cu (OH)2 + CuCO3

Now recall the activity of burning
magnesium ribbon. The ash obtained
on burning magnesium ribbon is
dissolved in water and tested for its
acidic/basic nature.
Is the solution acidic or basic? How
do you ascertain this?
You must have observed that the red
litmus turns blue. So, oxide of magnesium
is also basic in nature. In general, metallic
oxides are basic in nature.
Let us now observe the reaction of
non-metals with oxygen.

Activity 4.4
(To be demonstrated by the teacher
in the class)
Take a small amount of powdered
sulphur in a deflagrating spoon and
heat it. If deflagrating spoon is not

in Class VII. Note down their names in
Table 4.4. Identify the metal or nonmetal present in them which forms
oxides with oxygen.
Reaction with Water

(To be demonstrated by the teacher.
During demonstration special care
should be taken that the size of the
sodium metal piece is roughly the size
of a wheat grain. It should be held
with a pair of tongs.)
Take a 250 mL beaker/glass tumbler.
Fill half of it with water. Now
carefully cut a small piece of sodium
metal. Dry it using filter paper and
wrap it in a small piece of cotton.
Put the sodium piece wrapped in
cotton into the beaker. Observe
carefully. (During observation keep
away from the beaker). When
reaction stops touch the beaker.
What do you feel? Has the beaker
become hot? Test the solution with
red and blue litmus papers. Is the
solution acidic or basic?

Let us see how metals and non-metals
react with water.
Sodium metal is very reactive. It
reacts vigorously with oxygen and
water. A lot of heat is generated in
the reaction. It is, therefore, stored
in kerosene.

SCIENCE

2021–22

You observed that sodium reacts
vigorously with water. Some other metals
do not do so. For example, iron reacts
with water slowly.
Generally, non-metals do not react
with water though they may be very
reactive in air. Such non-metals are
stored in water. For example,

phosphorus is a very reactive non-metal.
It catches fire if exposed to air. To prevent
the contact of phosphorus with
atmospheric oxygen, it is stored in water.
Reactions with Acids
Let us see how metals and non-metals
behave with acids.

Activity 4.6
(Warning : Keep the mouth of the test tube away from your face. Use test tube
holder to hold the test tube.)
Take samples of metals and non-metals listed in Table 4.5 in separate test
tubes and label them as A, B, C, D, E, and F. With the help of a dropper add 5
mL of dilute hydrochloric acid to each test tube one by one. Observe the
reactions carefully. If no reaction occurs in the cold solution, warm the test
tube gently. Bring a burning matchstick near the mouth of each test tube.
Repeat the same activity using dilute sulphuric acid instead of the dilute
hydrochloric acid. Record your observations in Table 4.5.

Is there a difference in the way metals
and non-metals react with acids? What
could the ‘pop’ sound in some cases be
due to when a burning match stick is
brought near the mouth of the test tubes?
You must have found that nonmetals generally do not react with acids
but metals react with acids and produce
hydrogen gas that burns with a ‘pop’
sound. You must have noticed that
copper does not react with dilute
hydrochloric acid even on heating but
it reacts with sulphuric acid.

performed in Class VII. Let us observe
some more reactions of that kind.

Activity 4.8
Take five 100 mL beakers and label
them A, B, C, D and E. Take about
50 mL of water in each beaker.
Dissolve in each beaker a
teaspoonful of each substance as
indicated in Fig. 4.6 (a).
Ü Keep the beakers undisturbed for
some time.
Ü Record your observations in your
note book.

Reactions with Bases

Activity 4.7
(To be demonstrated by the teacher.
During the preparation of sodium
hydroxide solution, care should be
taken that pellets of sodium hydroxide
are handled with a plastic spatula).
Prepare a fresh solution of sodium

What changes do you observe in the
various beakers? You have read that one
metal displaces another metal from its
compound in aqueous solution. In
beaker ‘A’ zinc (Zn) replaces copper (Cu)
from copper sulphate (CuSO4). That is
why the blue colour of copper sulphate
disappears and a powdery red mass of
copper is deposited at the bottom of the
beaker. The reaction can be represented
as follows:
Copper Sulphate (CuSO4) + Zinc (Zn)
(Blue)
→ Zinc Sulphate (ZnSO4) + Copper (Cu)
(Colourless)
(Red)
You can write down the reaction
taking place in beaker ‘B’ in a similar
manner.

I have understood the reactions
taking place in beakers ‘A’ and
‘B’. But I am still confused why
there is no change in beakers
‘C’, ‘D’ and ‘E’?

There could have been displacement
of zinc by copper in beaker ‘C’ and by
iron in beaker ‘E’. Similarly iron could
be displaced by copper in beaker ‘D’.
Since we do not see any change in
beaker C, we can infer that copper is
not able to replace zinc from zinc
sulphate. But why? When zinc can
replace copper in beaker ‘A’ why
cannot copper replace zinc in beaker
‘C’? Remember that science is not

arbitrary. It follows definite rules
based on facts. And the rule here is
that zinc is more reactive than copper
and iron. A more reactive metal can
replace a less reactive metal, but a less
reactive one cannot replace a more
reactive metal. Now you can
understand why there are no
displacement reactions in beakers D
and E also. Can you guess the
sequence of metals from more reactive
to less reactive among zinc, iron and
copper?

4.3 Uses of Metals and
Non-metals
You should be able to guess why metals
are used in making machinery,
automobiles, aeroplanes, trains,
satellites, industrial gadgets, cooking
utensils, water boilers, etc. You are also
familiar with the uses of some nonmetals. Here are some interesting ones.
We are sure that you will guess them
right:
l

Non-metal is essential for our life
which all living beings inhale during
breathing,

l

Non-metals used in fertilisers to
enhance the growth of plants,

l

Non-metal used in water purification
process,

l

Non-metal used in the purple
coloured solution which is applied
on wounds as an antiseptic,

l

Non-metals used in crackers.

You may add some more uses of
metals and non-metals from your
experiences.

The doctor reported iron
deficiency in my body.
Where is iron in my body?

I heard that magnesium is
found in plants. In what
form is it found in them?

In Class VII, you have learnt that in a chemical reaction, new substances are
formed. These substances are different from those which underwent the reaction.
Now, if a substance cannot be broken down further by chemical reactions, by
cooling, heating, or by electrolysis, it is called ‘element’. Sulphur is an element.
So is iron. Carbon, too, is an element. The smallest unit of an element is atom. A
sample of an element contains only one kind of atom. The atom of an element
remains unaffected by physical changes in the element. For example, an atom of
liquid sulphur would be exactly the same as the atom of solid or vapour sulphur.
Although we have an infinite variety of substances in the universe, the number
of elements forming these substances is limited. There are no more than 94
naturally occurring elements. An important classification of elements is in terms
of metals and non-metals. Most of the elements are metals. The remaining are
either non-metals or metalloids. Metalloids possess character of both metals and
non-metals.
