POLLUTION OF AIR AND WATER

P

aheli and Boojho were very excited
to know that Taj Mahal in Agra
is one of the seven wonders of
the world. But they were disappointed
to hear that the beauty of this
monument in white marble is being
threatened by air pollution in the area
surrounding the Taj. They were eager
to know if something can be done to
control the air and water pollution.
We are all awar e that our
environment is not what it used to be.
Our elders talk about the clean water
and fresh air that was available in their
times. Now the media regularly reports
on the falling quality of the environment.
We ourselves feel the impact of the falling
quality of air and water in our lives. The
number of people suffering from diseases
of the respiratory system, for example,
is steadily rising.
We shudder to imagine a time when
clean air and water may no longer be
available! You have learnt about the
importance of air and water in your
previous classes. In this chapter, we will
study about the harmful changes taking
place in our surroundings and their
effects on our lives.

You already know that air consists
of a mixture of gases. By volume, about
78% of this mixture is nitrogen and
about 21% is oxygen. Carbon dioxide,
argon, methane, ozone and water
vapour are also present in very small
quantities.

Activity 18.1
You may have covered your nose
while passing a brick kiln emitting
smoke or started coughing while
walking on a busy road (Fig. 18.1).
On the basis of your experience,
compare the quality of air at the
places given below:
l A park and a busy road.
l A residential area and an
industrial area.
l A busy traffic intersection at
different times of the day e.g.
early morning, afternoon and
evening.
l A village and a town.

18.1 Air Pollution
We can survive for some time without food,
but we cannot survive even for a few
minutes without air. This simple fact tells
us how important clean air is to us.

2021–22

One of your observations in the
above activity could be the differences
in the amount of smoke in the
atmosphere. Do you know where the
smoke could have come from? Addition
of such substances to the atmosphere
modifies it. When air is contaminated
by unwanted substances which have
a harmful effect on both the living and
the non-living, it is referred to as air
pollution.

18.2 How does Air Get Polluted?
The substances which contaminate the
air are called air pollutants. Sometimes,
such substances may come from natural
sources like smoke and dust arising from
forest fires or volcanic eruptions.
Pollutants are also added to the
atmosphere by certain human activities.
The sources of air pollutants are
factories (Fig. 18.2), power plants,
automobile exhausts and burning of
firewood and dung cakes.

Activity 18.2
You might have read in the
newspapers that respiratory
problems amongst children
are rising day by day. Conduct a
survey of households in your
neighbourhood and among friends
to find out how many children are
suffering from respiratory problems.
Many respiratory problems are
caused by air pollution. Let us now try
to find out the substances or pollutants
which are present in the polluted air.
Have you noticed how rapidly the
number of vehicles is increasing in our
cities?
Vehicles produce high levels of
pollutants like carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, nitrogen oxides and smoke (Fig.
18.3). Carbon monoxide is produced
from incomplete burning of fuels such
as petrol and diesel. It is a poisonous
gas. It reduces the oxygen-carrying
capacity of the blood.

Fig. 18.3 : Air pollution due to automobiles

Do you know?
If the vehicles registered in Delhi are
lined up one after the other, the total
length would be nearly equal to the
combined lengths of the two longest
rivers in the world, Nile and Amazon!

SCIENCE

2021–22

Boojho remembers seeing a thick
fog-like layer in the atmosphere,
especially during winters. This is smog
which is made up of smoke and fog.
Smoke may contain oxides of nitrogen
which combine with other air pollutants
and fog to form smog. The smog causes
breathing difficulties such as asthma,
cough and wheezing in children.
Many industries are also responsible
for causing air pollution. Petroleum
refineries are a major source of gaseous
pollutants like sulphur dioxide and
nitrogen dioxide. Sulphur dioxide is
produced by combustion of fuels like
coal in power plants. It can cause
respiratory problems, including
permanent lung damage. You have
already studied about the burning of
fossil fuels in Chapter 5.
Other kinds of pollutants are
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are
used in refrigerators, air conditioners
and aerosol sprays. CFCs damage the
ozone layer of the atmosphere. Recall
that the ozone layer protects us from
harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun. Have
you heard of the ozone hole? Try to find
out about it. Thankfully, less harmful
chemicals are now being used in place
of CFCs.
In addition to the above mentioned
gases, automobiles which burn diesel
and petrol, also produce tiny particles
which remain suspended in air for long
periods (Fig. 18.3). They reduce
visibility. When inhaled, they cause
diseases. Such particles are also
produced during industrial processes
like steel making and mining. Power
plants give out tiny ash particles which
also pollute the atmosphere.

Activity 18.3
Prepare a table using the pollutants
mentioned above. You may even add
more data to the following Table.
Table 18.1
Air Pollutants Sources Effects

18.3 Case Study—
The Taj Mahal
Over the past 2 decades, India’s most
famous tourist attraction, Taj Mahal
located in Agra (Fig. 18.4), has become
a matter of concern. Experts have
warned that pollutants in air are
discolouring its white marble. So, it is
not only living organisms that get
affected by polluted air but non-living
things like buildings, monuments and
statues also get affected.
The industries located in and around
Agra like rubber processing, automobile,
chemicals and especially the Mathura oil
refinery, have been responsible for
producing pollutants like sulphur
dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. These
gases react with the water vapour present
in the atmosphere to form sulphuric acid
and nitric acid. The acids drop down with
rain, making the rain acidic. This is
called acid rain. Acid rain corrodes the
marble of the monument. The
phenomenon is also called “Marble
cancer”. Suspended particulate matter,
such as the soot particles emitted by
Mathura oil refinery, has contributed
towards the yellowing of the marble.
The Supreme Court has taken
several steps to save the Taj. It has

ordered industries to switch to cleaner
fuels like CNG (Compressed Natural Gas)
and LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas).
Moreover, the automobiles should
switch over to unleaded petrol in the Taj
zone.
Discuss with your elders and see
what they have to say about the
condition of the Taj, 20 or 30 years ago!
Try to procure a picture of the Taj Mahal
for your scrap book.

I am reminded of the
chapter on crops. I
wonder whether acid rain
affects the soil and
plants also.

and a part is reflected back into space.
A part of the reflected radiation is
trapped by the atmosphere. The trapped
radiations further warm the earth. If you
have seen a greenhouse in a nursery or
elsewhere, recall that the sun’s heat is
allowed to get in but is not allowed to
go out. The trapped heat warms the
green house. The trapping of radiations
by the earth’s atmosphere is similar.
That is why it is called the greenhouse
effect. Without this process, life would
not have been possible on the earth. But
now it threatens life. Excess of CO2 in
the air is one of the gases responsible
for this effect.
You know that CO2 is one of the
components of air. You have also studied

18.4 Greenhouse Effect

earth’s surface. A part of the radiation

the role of carbon dioxide in plants. But
if there is excess of CO2 in the air, it
acts as a pollutant.
Can you help Paheli find out the
answer to her question?
On the one hand, CO2 is continuously
being released because of human
activities. On the other hand, area under
forests is decreasing. Plants utilise CO2
from the atmosphere for photosynthesis,
thereby decreasing the amount of CO2
in the air. Deforestation leads to an
increase in the amount of CO2 in the air
because the number of trees which
consume CO 2 is reduced. Human
activities, thus, contribute to the
accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere.
CO2 traps heat and does not allow it to
escape into space. As a result, the average
temperature of the earth’s atmosphere
is gradually increasing. This is called
global warming.
Other gases like methane, nitrous
oxide and water vapour also contribute
Global Warming
A Serious Threat!
Global warming can cause sea levels
to rise dramatically. In many places,
coastal areas have already been
flooded. Global warming could result
in wide ranging effects on rainfall
patterns, agriculture, forests, plants
and animals. Majority of people living
in regions which are threatened by
global warming are in Asia. A recent
climate change report gives us only
a limited time to keep the greenhouse
gases at the present level. Otherwise,
the temperature may rise by more
than 2 degrees Celsius by the end of
the century, a level considered
dangerous.

towards this effect. Like CO2, they are
also called greenhouse gases.
Global warming has become a major
concern for governments worldwide.
Many countries have reached an
agreement to reduce the emission of
greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol
is one such agreement.
Boojho is surprised to hear that an
increase in the earth’s temperature by
even as little as 0.5 °C can have such a
serious effect! Paheli tells him that she
had read in the newspapers recently that
the Gangotri glacier in the Himalayas
has started melting because of global
warming.

18.5 What can be Done?
What can we do to reduce air
pollution?
There are many success stories in our
fight against air pollution. For example,
a few years ago, Delhi was one of the
most polluted cities in the world. It was
being choked by fumes released from
automobiles running on diesel and
petrol. A decision was taken to switch
to fuels like CNG (Fig. 18.5) and

resulted in cleaner air for the city. You
might know of some other examples
from your area regarding reduction of
air pollution. Share these with your
friends.

fuels for our energy requirements. These
could be solar energy, hydropower and
wind energy.

Activity 18.4
You have various options of
commuting to your school such as
walking, going by bicycle, travelling
by bus or other public transport,
using a car individually, travelling
by car pool. Discuss in your class
the impact of each of these options
on the quality of air.

Do you know about the “Say no to
crackers” campaign which was
organised by children from many
schools? This made a big difference
to the air pollution levels around
Diwali.

The quality of air at various locations
is monitored regularly by government
and other agencies. We can use this data
to generate awareness about air
pollution
among
friends
and
neighbours.
There is a need to switch over to
alternative fuels instead of the fossil

Small contributions on our part can
make a huge difference in the state of
the environment. We can plant trees and
nurture the ones already present in the
neighbourhood. Do you know about Van
Mahotsav, when lakhs of trees are
planted in July every year (Fig. 18.6)?

Boojho and Paheli once happened to
go to an area where some people were
burning dry leaves. They started
coughing because the entire area was full
of smoke. Paheli thought it would be a
better option to put them in a compost
pit rather than burning. What do you
think?

Activity 18.5
Try to collect samples of water from
a tap, pond, river, well and lake.
Pour each into separate glass
containers. Compare these for
smell, acidity and colour. Complete
the following Table.

18.6 Water Pollution

Smell

In Class VII you learnt that water is a
precious resource. Think and list the
various activities in which we need
water. We saw that water is becoming
scarce due to increase in population,
industries and agricultural activities.
You have also studied how water
becomes “dirty” after we use it for
washing clothes, bathing, etc. This
means that we are adding some
materials to the water, which spoil its
quality and change its smell and colour.
Whenever harmful substances such
as sewage, toxic chemicals, silt, etc., get
mixed with water, the water becomes
polluted. The substances that pollute
water are called water pollutants.

livelihood. However, recently a study by
the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
found that Ganga is one of the ten most
endangered rivers in the world. The
pollution levels have been rising for
many years. We have reached this stage
because the towns and cities, through
which the river flows, throw large
quantities of garbage, untreated sewage,
dead bodies, and many other harmful
things, directly into the river. In fact the
river is ‘dead’ at many places where the
pollution levels are so high that aquatic
life cannot survive.
An ambitious plan to save the river,
called the Ganga Action Plan was
launched in 1985. It aimed to reduce
the pollution levels in the river. However,
the increasing population and
industrialisation have already damaged
this mighty river beyond repair. Now, the
Government of India has launched a new
initiative known as National Mission for
Clean Ganga (NMCG) in 2016.
Let us take a specific example to
understand the situation. The Ganga
at Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh (U.P.), has
one of the most polluted stretches of
the river (Fig. 18.8). Kanpur is one of
the most populated towns in U.P.

People can be seen bathing, washing
clothes and defecating in the river.
They also throw garbage, flowers,
idols of gods and goddesses and nonbiodegradable polythene bags into the
river.
At Kanpur the amount of water is
comparatively small and the flow of the
river is very slow. In addition, Kanpur
has more than 5000 industries. These
include fertiliser, detergent, leather and
paint industries. These industrial units
discharge toxic chemical wastes into the
river.
Based on the above information
think of the answers to the following
questions –

Fig. 18.8 : A polluted stretch of the river
Ganga

Fig. 18.9 : Industrial waste discharged into
a river

What are the factors responsible for
pollution of the river ?
l What steps can be taken to restore
the river Ganga to its past glory ?
l How would the disposal of garbage,
etc., affect the living organisms in the
river ?
l

Many industries discharge harmful
chemicals into rivers and streams,
causing the pollution of water
(Fig. 18.9). Examples are oil refineries,
paper factories, textile and sugar mills

246

SCIENCE

2021–22

and chemical factories. These industries
cause chemical contamination of water.
The chemicals released include arsenic,
lead and fluorides which lead to toxicity
in plants and animals. There are
regulations to prevent this. Industries
are supposed to treat the waste
produced before discharging it into
waters, but quite often the rules are not
followed. The soil is also affected by
impure water, causing changes in
acidity, growth of worms, etc.
We have learnt in Chapter 1 the
importance of pesticides and weedicides
for the protection of crops. However, all
these chemicals dissolve in water and
are washed into water bodies from the
fields. They also seep into the ground
to pollute ground water.
Have you seen ponds which look
green from a distance because they have
a lot of algae growing in them? This is
caused by excessive quantities of
chemicals which get washed from the
fields. These act as nutrients for algae
to flourish. Once these algae die, they
serve as food for decomposers like
bacteria. A lot of oxygen in the water
body gets used up. This results in a
decrease in the oxygen level which may
kill aquatic organisms.

food wastes, detergents, microor ganisms, etc. Can ground water get
polluted by sewage? How? Water
contaminated with sewage may contain
bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites
which cause diseases like cholera,
typhoid and jaundice.
The bacteria present in the faeces
of mammals are indicators of the
quality of water. If water has these
bacteria, it means that it has been
contaminated by fecal matter. If such
water is used by us, it can cause various
infections.
Do you know?
Hot water can also be a pollutant !
This is usually water from power
plants and industries. It is released
into the rivers. It raises the
temperature of the waterbody,
adversely affecting the animals and
plants living in it.

18.8 What is Potable Water
and How is Water
Purified ?
Activity 18.7

disposal system of your locality in
Class VII.
Do you remember how the

water. Boiling kills the germs present
in the water.
l Chlorination is a commonly used
chemical method for purifying water.
It is done by adding chlorine tablets
or bleaching powder to the water. We
must be cautious. We should not
use more chlorine tablets than
specified.

Discuss the following questions
amongst yourselves and with your
teacher:
l Why do we need to filter water
before drinking ?
l Where do you get your drinking
water from?
l What will happen if we drink
polluted water?
Boojho is very upset. He tells Paheli
that he drank water which looked clear
and was without any smell, but still he
fell sick !
Paheli explains that water which
looks clean may still have diseasecarrying microorganisms and dissolved
impurities. So, it is essential to purify
water before drinking, for example, by
boiling.
Water which is suitable for drinking
is called potable water. You have seen
how various physical and chemical
processes in the sewage treatment
plants help to clean water before
discharging it into water bodies.
Similarly, municipal bodies treat the
water before supplying it to households.
Do you know?
25% of the world’s population is
without safe drinking water !

Let us see how water can be made
safe for drinking:
l You have already seen how water is
filtered. This is a physical method of
removing impurities. A popular
household filter is a candle type
filter.
l Many households use boiling as a
method for obtaining safe drinking

18.9 What Can be Done?
Activity 18.8
Investigate the level of awareness
about water pollution in your area.
Collect data on the sources of
drinking water and the methods of
sewage disposal.
What are the common water-borne
diseases in the community? You can
consult your local doctor/health
worker for this.
Which are the governmental and
non-governmental organisations
working in this field? What are the
measures being taken by them for
generating awareness?
Laws for industrial units should be
strictly implemented so that polluted
water is not disposed off directly into
rivers and lakes. Water treatment plants
should be installed in all industrial
areas (Fig. 18.10). At our individual
levels we should consciously save water
and not waste it. Reduce, reuse and
recycle should be our mantra !
Think of your daily routine – how
can you save water?
We can think of creative ideas like
reusing water used for washing and for
other household tasks. For example,

water used for washing vegetables may
be used to water plants in the garden.
Pollution is no longer a distant
phenomenon. It is affecting the quality

of our daily lives. Unless we all realise
our responsibility and start using
environment-friendly processes, the very
survival of our planet is in danger.

Do you know?
While brushing your teeth, leaving the tap running may waste several
litres of water. A tap that drips once every second wastes a few thousand
litres of water every year. Think about it !
