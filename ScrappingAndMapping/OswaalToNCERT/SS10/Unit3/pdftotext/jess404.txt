In the previous chapter we noted that the existence of social diversity
does not threaten democracy. Political expression of social differences
is possible and sometimes quite desirable in a democratic system. In
this chapter we apply these ideas to the practice of democracy in
India. We look at three kinds of social differences that can take the
form of social divisions and inequalities. These are social differences
based on gender, religion and caste. In each case we look at the
nature of this division in India and how it gets expressed in politics.
We also ask whether different expressions based on these differences
are healthy or otherwise in a democracy.

Sexual division of labour:
A system in which all work
inside the home is either
done by the women of the
family, or organised by
them through the
domestic helpers.

Why are we
discussing things
like household
work in this
textbook on
Political Science?
Is this politics?

Let us begin with gender division. This
is a form of hierarchical social division
seen everywhere, but is rarely recognised
in the study of politics. The gender
division tends to be understood as natural
and unchangeable. However, it is not
based on biology but on social
expectations and stereotypes.

Why not? If
politics is about
power, then
surely male
dominance in the
household should
be considered
political.

Boys and girls are brought up to believe
that the main responsibility of women is
housework and bringing up children.
This is reflected in a SEXUAL DIVISION OF
LABOUR in most families: women do all
work inside the home such as cooking,
cleaning, washing clothes, tailoring,
looking after children, etc., and men do
all the work outside the home. It is not
that men cannot do housework; they
simply think that it is for women to
attend to these things. When these jobs
are paid for, men are ready to take up
these works. Most tailors or cooks in
hotels are men. Similarly, it is not that
women do not work outside their home.
In villages, women fetch water, collect
fuel and work in the fields. In urban
areas, poor women work as domestic
helper in middle class homes, while
middle class women work in offices. In
fact the majority of women do some
sort of paid work in addition to
domestic labour. But their work is not
valued and does not get recognition.
The result of this division of labour
is that although women constitute half
of the humanity, their role in public life,
especially politics, is minimal in most
societies. Earlier, only men were allowed
to participate in public affairs, vote and
contest for public offices. Gradually the
gender issue was raised in politics.
Women in different parts of the world
organised and agitated for equal rights.
There were agitations in different
countries for the extension of voting
rights to women. These agitations

a lot of direct income generating work, but the bulk of their work
is household related. This work remains unpaid and invisible.

One way to solve this problem is
to make it legally binding to have a
fair proportion of women in the
elected bodies. This is what the
Panchayati Raj has done in India. Onethird of seats in local government
bodies – in panchayats and
municipalities – are now reserved for
women. Now there are more than 10
lakh elected women representatives in
rural and urban local bodies.

Gender division is an example
that some form of social division
needs to be expressed in politics.
This also shows that disadvantaged
groups do benefit when social
divisions become a political issue. Do

Religion, communalism and politics

I am not religious.
Why should I
bother about
communalism and
secularism?

Let us now turn to a very different kind
of social division, the division based on
religious differences. This division is not
as universal as gender, but religious
diversity is fairly widespread in the world
today. Many countries including India
have in their population, followers of
different religions. As we noticed in the
case of Northern Ireland, even when
most of the people belong to the same
religion, there can be serious differences
about the way people practice that
religion. Unlike gender differences, the
religious differences are often expressed
in the field of politics.
Consider the following:
l Gandhiji used to say that religion can
never be separated from politics. What
he meant by religion was not any

46
2020-21

particular religion like Hinduism or Islam
but moral values that inform all religions.
He believed that politics must be guided
by ethics drawn from religion.
l Human rights groups in our country
have argued that most of the victims of
communal riots in our country are
people from religious minorities. They
have demanded that the government
take special steps to protect religious
minorities.
l Women’s movement has argued
that FAMILY LAWS of all religions
discriminate against women. So they
have demanded that government should
change these laws to make them more
equitable.
All these instances involve a
relationship between religion and politics.

Communalism
The problem begins when religion is seen
as the basis of the nation. The example
of Northern Ireland in Chapter 3 shows
the dangers of such an approach to
nationalism. The problem becomes
more acute when religion is expressed
in politics in exclusive and partisan terms,
when one religion and its followers are
pitted against another. This happens when
beliefs of one religion are presented as
superior to those of other religions,
when the demands of one religious
group are formed in opposition to
another and when state power is used
to establish domination of one religious
group over the rest. This manner of
using religion in politics is communal
politics.
Communal politics is based on the
idea that religion is the principal basis of
social community. Communalism
involves thinking along the following
lines. The followers of a particular
religion must belong to one community.
Their fundamental interests are the same.
Any difference that they may have is
irrelevant or trivial for community life.
It also follows that people who follow
different religions cannot belong to the

same social community. If the followers
of different religion have some
commonalities these are superficial and
immaterial. Their interests are bound to
be different and involve a conflict. In its
extreme form communalism leads to the
belief that people belonging to different
religions cannot live as equal citizens
within one nation. Either, one of them
has to dominate the rest or they have to
form different nations.

I often crack
jokes about
people from one
religion. Does
that make me
communal?

This belief is fundamentally flawed.
People of one religion do not have the
same interests and aspirations in every
context. Everyone has several other roles,
positions and identities. There are many
voices inside every community. All these
voices have a right to be heard. Therefore
any attempt to bring all followers of one
religion together in context other than
religion is bound to suppress many voices
within that community.
Communalism can take various
forms in politics:
l The most common expression of
communalism is in everyday beliefs.
These routinely involve religious
prejudices, stereotypes of religious
communities and belief in the superiority
of one’s religion over other religions. This
is so common that we often fail to notice
it, even when we believe in it.
l A communal mind often leads to a
quest for political dominance of one’s
own religious community. For those
belonging to majority community, this
takes the for m of majoritarian
dominance. For those belonging to the
minority community, it can take the
form of a desire to form a separate
political unit.
l Political mobilisation on religious
lines is another frequent form of

Family laws: Those
laws that deal with
family related matters
such as marriage,
divorce, adoption,
inheritance, etc. In our
country, different family
laws apply to followers
of different religions.

G e n d e r, R e l i g i o n a n d C a s t e

But they do not seem very wrong or
dangerous. Ideas, ideals and values
drawn from different religions can and
perhaps should play a role in politics.
People should be able to express in
politics their needs, interests and demands
as a member of a religious community.
Those who hold political power should
sometimes be able to regulate the
practice of religion so as to prevent
discrimination and oppression. These
political acts are not wrong as long as
they treat every religion equally.

communalism. This involves the use of
sacred symbols, religious leaders,
emotional appeal and plain fear in order
to bring the followers of one religion
together in the political arena. In electoral
politics this often involves special appeal
to the interests or emotions of voters
of one religion in preference to others.
l Sometimes communalism takes its
most ugly form of communal violence,
riots and massacre. India and Pakistan
suffered some of the worst communal
riots at the time of the Partition. The
post-Independence period has also seen
large scale communal violence.

Secular state
Communalism was and continues to
be one of the major challenges to
democracy in our country. The makers
of our Constitution were aware of this
challenge. That is why they chose the
model of a secular state. This choice was
reflected in several constitutional
provisions that we studied last year:
l There is no official religion for the
Indian state. Unlike the status of
Buddhism in Sri Lanka, that of Islam in
Pakistan and that of Christianity in
England, our Constitution does not give
a special status to any religion.

l The Constitution provides to all
individuals and communities freedom to
profess, practice and propagate any
religion, or not to follow any.
l The Constitution prohibits
discrimination on grounds of religion.

Understood in this sense, secularism
is not just an ideology of some parties
or persons. This idea constitutes one of
the foundations of our country.
Communalism should not be seen as a
threat to some people in India. It
threatens the very idea of India. That is
why communalism needs to be
combated. A secular Constitution like
ours is necessary but not sufficient to
combat communalism. Communal
prejudices and propaganda need to be

l At the same time, the Constitution
allows the state to intervene in the
matters of religion in order to ensure
equality within religious communities.
For example, it bans untouchability.

countered in everyday life and religionbased mobilisation needs to be
countered in the arena of politics.

Caste inequalities

this system, hereditary occupational
division was sanctioned by rituals.
Members of the same caste group were
supposed to form a social community
that practiced the same or similar
occupation, married within the caste
group and did not eat with members
from other caste groups.

Unlike gender and religion, caste division
is special to India. All societies have some
kind of social inequality and some form
of division of labour. In most societies,
occupations are passed on from one
generation to another. Caste system is an
extreme form of this. What makes it
different from other societies is that in

Caste system was based on exclusion
of and discrimination against the
‘outcaste’ groups. They were subjected
to the inhuman practice of untouchability

IX. That is why political leaders and social
reformers like Jotiba Phule, Gandhiji,
B.R. Ambedkar and Periyar Ramaswami

We have seen two instances of the
expression of social divisions in the arena
of politics, one largely positive and the
other largely negative. Let us turn to our
final case, that of caste and politics, that
has both positive and the negative aspects.

Social and Religious Diversity of India
The Census of India records the religion of each and every Indian after every ten years.
The person who fills the Census form visits every household and records the religion of
each member of that household exactly the way each person describes it. If someone
says she has ‘no religion’ or that he is an ‘atheist’, this is exactly how it is recorded.
Thus we have reliable information on the proportion of different religious communities in
the country and how it has changed over the years. The pie chart below presents the
population proportion of six major religious communities in the country. Since
Independence, the total population of each community has increased substantially but
their proportion in the country’s population has not changed much. In percentage terms,
the population of the Hindus, Jains and Christians has declined marginally since 1961.
The proportion of Muslim, Sikh and Buddhist population has increased slightly. There is a
common but mistaken impression that the proportion of the Muslims in the country’s
population is going to overtake other religious communities. Expert estimates done for
the Prime Minister’s High Level Committee (popularly known as Sachar Committee) show
that the proportion of the Muslims is expected to go up a little, by about 3 to 4 per cent,
in the next 50 years. It proves that in overall terms, the population balance of different
religious communities is not likely to change in a big way.

D e m o c ratic Politics

The same is true of the major caste groups. The Census of India counts two social
groups: the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Both these broad groups
include hundreds of castes or tribes whose names are listed in an official Schedule.
Hence the prefix ‘Scheduled’ in their name. The Scheduled Castes, commonly known as
Dalits, include those that were previously regarded as ‘outcaste’ in the Hindu social
order and were subjected to exclusion and untouchability. The Scheduled Tribes, often
referred to as Adivasis, include those communities that led a secluded life usually in hills
and forests and did not interact much with the rest of society. In 2011, the Scheduled
Castes were 16.6 per cent and the
Scheduled Tribes were 8.6 per cent

Partly due to their efforts and partly
due to other socio-economic changes,
castes and caste system in modern India
have undergone great changes. With
economic development, large scale
URBANISATION, growth of literacy and
education, OCCUPATIONAL MOBILITY and
the weakening of the position of
landlords in the villages, the old notions
of CASTE HIERARCHY are breaking down.
Now, most of the times, in urban areas
it does not matter much who is walking
along next to us on a street or eating at
the next table in a restaurant. The
Constitution of India prohibited any
caste-based discrimination and laid the
foundations of policies to reverse the
injustices of the caste system. If a person
who lived a century ago were to return
to India, she would be greatly surprised
at the change that has come about in
the country.
Yet caste has not disappeared from
contemporary India. Some of the older
aspects of caste have persisted. Even
now most people marry within their
own caste or tribe. Untouchability has
not ended completely, despite
constitutional prohibition. Effects of
centuries of advantages and
disadvantages continue to be felt today.
The caste groups that had access to
education under the old system have
done very well in acquiring modern
education as well. Those groups that did
not have access to education or were
prohibited from acquiring it have naturally
lagged behind. That is why there is a
disproportionately large presence of
‘upper caste’ among the urban middle
classes in our country. Caste continues to

be closely linked to economic status.
(See Plus Box on Page 52.)

Caste in politics
As in the case of communalism, casteism
is rooted in the belief that caste is the
sole basis of social community.
According to this way of thinking,
people belonging to the same caste
belong to a natural social community and
have the same interests which they do
not share with anyone from another caste.
As we saw in the case of communalism,
such a belief is not borne out by our
experience. Caste is one aspect of our
experience but it is not the only relevant
or the most important aspect.
Caste can take various forms in politics:
l When parties choose candidates in
elections, they keep in mind the caste
composition of the electorate and
nominate candidates from different
castes so as to muster necessary support
to win elections. When governments are
formed, political parties usually take care
that representatives of different castes and
tribes find a place in it.

Urbanisation: Shift of
population from rural
areas to urban areas.
Occupational
mobility: Shift from
one occupation to
another, usually when a
new generation takes up
occupations other than
those practiced by their
ancestors.
Caste hierarchy: A
ladder like formation in
which all the caste
groups are placed from
the ‘highest’ to the
‘lowest’ castes.

Naicker advocated and worked to

Caste inequality today
Caste is an important source of economic inequality because it regulates access
to resources of various kinds. For example, in the past, the so-called
‘untouchable’ castes were denied the right to own land, while only the so-called
‘twice born’ castes had the right to education. Although this kind of explicit and
formalised inequality based on caste is now outlawed, the effects of centuries of
accumulated advantages and disadvantages continue to be felt. Moreover, new
kinds of inequalities have also developed.
The relationship between caste and economic status has certainly changed a lot.
Today, it is possible to find very rich and very poor people in every caste,
whether ‘low’ or ‘high’. This was not true even twenty or thirty years ago – it
was very rare indeed to find rich people among the ‘lowest’ castes. However, as
this evidence from the National Sample Survey shows, caste continues to be very
strongly linked to economic status in many important ways:
l The average economic status (measured by criteria like monthly consumption
expenditure) of caste groups still follows the old hierarchy – the ‘upper’ castes
are best off, the Dalits and Adivasis are worst off, and the backward classes are
in between.
l Although every caste has some poor members, the proportion living in
extreme poverty (below the official ‘poverty line’) is much higher for the lowest
castes and much lower for the upper castes, with the backward classes once
again in between.
l Although every caste has some members who are rich, the upper castes are
heavily over-represented among the rich while the lower castes are severely
under-represented.

l Universal adult franchise and the
principle of one-person-one-vote
compelled political leaders to gear up
to the task of mobilising and securing
political support. It also brought new
consciousness among the people of
castes that were hitherto treated as
inferior and low.
The focus on caste in politics can
sometimes give an impression that
elections are all about caste and nothing
else. That is far from true. Just consider
these:
l No parliamentary constituency in
the country has a clear majority of one
single caste. So, every candidate and party
needs to win the confidence of more
than one caste and community to win
elections.

Clearly, while caste matters in
electoral politics, so do many other
factors. The voters have strong
attachment to political parties which is
often stronger than their attachment to
their caste or community. People within
the same caste or community have
different interests depending on their
economic condition. Rich and poor or
men and women from the same caste
often vote very differently. People’s
assessment of the performance of the
government and the popularity rating of
the leaders matter and are often decisive
in elections.

Politics in caste
We have so far looked at what caste does
to politics. But it does not mean that there
is only a one-way relation between caste
and politics. Politics too influences the
caste system and caste identities by
bringing them into the political arena.

l No party wins the votes of all the
voters of a caste or community. When
people say that a caste is a ‘vote bank’
of one party, it usually means that a large
proportion of the voters from that caste
vote for that party.
l Many political parties may put up
candidates from the same caste (if that
caste is believed to dominate the
electorate in a particular constituency).
Some voters have more than one
candidate from their caste while many
voters have no candidate from their
caste.

or MLA frequently lose elections in our
country. That could not have happened
if all castes and communities were
frozen in their political preferences.

Do you think that political leaders are right to treat people belonging
to a caste as ‘vote banks’?

G e n d e r, R e l i g i o n a n d C a s t e

l Political parties and candidates in
elections make appeals to caste sentiment
to muster support. Some political parties
are known to favour some castes and
are seen as their representatives.

Thus, it is not politics that gets casteridden, it is the caste that gets politicised.
This takes several forms:
l Each caste group tries to become
bigger by incorporating within it
neighbouring castes or sub-castes which
were earlier excluded from it.
l Various caste groups are required to
enter into a coalition with other castes or
communities and thus enter into a
dialogue and negotiation.
l New kinds of caste groups have
come up in the political arena like
‘backward’ and ‘forward’ caste groups.
Thus, caste plays different kinds of
roles in politics. In some situations,
expression of caste differences in politics
gives many disadvantaged communities
the space to demand their share of
power. In this sense-caste politics has
helped people from Dalits and OBC
castes to gain better access to decision
making. Several political and non-political
organisations have been demanding and
agitating for an end to discrimination
against particular castes, for more dignity
and more access to land, resources and
opportunities.

At the same time exclusive attention
to caste can produce negative results as
well. As in the case of religion, politics
based on caste identity alone is not very
healthy in a democracy. It can divert
attention from other pressing issues like
poverty, development and corruption. In
some cases caste division leads to
tensions, conflict and even violence.
