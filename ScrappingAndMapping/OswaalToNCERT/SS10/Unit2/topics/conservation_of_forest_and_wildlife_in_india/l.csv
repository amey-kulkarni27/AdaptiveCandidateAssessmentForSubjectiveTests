Write a note on Joint Forest Management. ," In India, the Joint Forest Management programme furnishes a good example for involving local communities in the management and restoration of degraded forests.  The programme has been in formal existence since 1988 when the state of Odisha passed the first resolution for Joint Forest Management.    Joint Forest Management depends on the formation of local  institutions that undertake protection activities mostly on degraded forest land managed by the forest department. In return, the members of these communities are entitled to intermediary benefits like non-timber forest produces and share in the timber harvested by ‘successful protection’."
