Distinguish between stock and potential resource. Give one example of each. ,"Ans.		 Stock :  They are found in the environment.  They are not accessed due to the lack of technology.  Example : Water is a compound of two inflammable gases – Hydrogen and Oxygen, which can be used as a rich source of energy. But we lack in the proper know-how of the technology. Potential resources :  They are found in a region.  They are not yet utilized or developed.  Example : Rajasthan and Gujarat have enormous potential for the development of wind and solar energy but they are yet to be developed for various reasons. 				  1½+1½=3"

Minerals and fossil fuels are examples of such resources. These resources take millions of years in their formation.

Differentiate between Stock and Reserve stating two points of difference. ,"Stock : Materials which have the potential to satisfy human beings but human do not have the technology to access these, e.g., water which is a compound of two inflammable gases—Hydrogen and oxygen and can be a rich source of energy. We do not know how to use them. 		Reserves : These are subset of the stock. They can be put into use with existing know-how but their use has not been started. e.g., River water is used as a source of hydroelectricity but to a limited extent."
“India’s vast and diverse size is the most important resource.” Support the statement. ,"In India, there are regions which are rich in certain types of resources but are deficient in some other resources :  Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits.  Arunachal Pradesh has abundant water resources.  Rajasthan is endowed with solar and wind energy."
