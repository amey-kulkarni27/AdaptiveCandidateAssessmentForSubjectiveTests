0,Q. 1. What are minerals ? ,Ans. The elements or compounds which occur naturally in the earth’s crust are called minerals.
1,"Q. 2. What is meant by metallurgy ? [Board Term-I, Set (26) 2011]",Ans. The extraction of metals from their ores and then refining them for use is known as metallurgy.
2,"Q. 3. What is thermite reaction ? [Board Term - I Set (B1), 2010]",Ans. Reduction of iron oxide to iron by aluminium is called thermite reaction. → 2Fe + Al2O3 + Heat. Fe2O3 + 2Al 
3,Q. 4. What is the process of depositing Zinc on iron called ? ,Ans. Galvanisation.
4,Q. 5. Aluminium and zinc do not corrode easily even though they are reactive metals. Give reasons for your answer.,Ans. Aluminium and zinc react with moist air to form a thin protective layer of oxide on their surfaces. This layer prevents further corrosion of the metals.
5,"Q. 6. A non-metal X exists in two different forms Y and Z. Y is the hardest natural substance, where as Z is a good conductor of electricity. Identify X, Y and Z.","Ans. X is carbon (non-metal). X exists in the form of allotropes, Y is diamond and Z is Graphite."
6,Q. 7. A metallic ore ‘X’ reacts with dilute HCl to liberate a gas which turns lime water milky. (1 mark each) Another ore ‘Y’ gives off a gas with the smell of rotten eggs on treatment with the same acid. Which metallurgical processes are used for the extraction of the metals X and Y ?,"Ans. X is a carbonate ore since it gives off carbon dioxide on treatment with HCl. So, X is extracted by the process of calcination. Y gives off hydrogen sulphide gas on treatment with dilute HCl. So, it is a sulphide ore which is extracted by roasting."
7,"Q. 8. Why do we apply paint on iron articles ? [Board Term-I Set (34) Set (B2) 2010, 2011]","Ans. Paint forms a protective coating on the surface of iron. Then oxygen and moisture present in the air cannot have a direct contact with the metal. Therefore, surface gets protected against rusting. 1"
8,"Q. 9. Why is carbon not used for reducing aluminium from aluminium oxide ? [Board Term-I 2011, Set (13)]","Ans. Because aluminium has greater affinity for oxygen than for carbon, therefore carbon cannot reduce alumina (Al2O3) to aluminium."
9,"Q. 10. What happens when ZnCO3 is heated in the absence of air ? Give the relevant equation. [Board Term-I, Set (14) 2011, Set (C2) 2010]",Ans. ZnO(s) and CO2(g) are formed. ZnCO3 ∆ → ZnO + CO2
