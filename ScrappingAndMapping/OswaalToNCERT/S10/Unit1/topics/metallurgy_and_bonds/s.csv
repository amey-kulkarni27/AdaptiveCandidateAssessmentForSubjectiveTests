0,Q. 1. What are ionic compounds ? List two properties of these compounds. ,Ans. The compounds which have bonds formed by loss and gain of electrons are called ionic compounds or electrovalent compound and the bond formed is known as ionic bond or electrovalent bond.

1,"Q. 2. Why do ionic compounds have high melting points ? State reason. [Board Term-I, Set (18) 2012]","Ans. In ionic compounds, cations and anions are held together by strong electrostatic forces of attraction. Hence large amount of energy is required to overcome these forces. "
2,"Q. 3. Define amphoteric oxides. Give two examples of such oxides. [Board Term-I, Set (38) 2012]",Ans. Oxides which show both acidic and basic behaviour and oxides that react with both acids as well as bases to produce salts and water. Example : Al2O3 and ZnO. 
3,"Q. 4. Define ionic compounds. Ionic compounds conduct electricity only in the molten state and not in solid state. Why ? [Board Term-I, Set (38) 2012]","Ans. The compounds formed by the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal are called ionic compounds. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct electricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible due to their rigid structure, but in the molten state ions move freely. "

25,Q. 4. Describe electrolytic refining of copper with chemical equations. Draw a well labelled diagram for it.   (3 marks each),"Ans. Electrolytic Refining : This method is widely used as purification of metals like zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), aluminium (Al), chromium (Cr), tin (Sn), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni) and gold (Au). In this process, impure metal is used as anode, a strip of pure metal is used as cathode and soluble salt of metal is used as electrolyte. On passing electric current through the electrolyte, cations move towards cathode, gain electrons and pure metal gets deposited on cathode. In electrolytic refining of copper, the impurities left behind at anode called anode mud contains valuable metals such as gold and silver which can be recovered in the native state.
