0,"Q. 1. A non-metal A is an important constituent of our food and forms two oxides B and C. Oxide B is toxic whereas C causes global warming. (i) Identify A, B and C. (ii) To which group of periodic table does A belong ?  3","Ans. (i) A — Carbon (C); B — Carbon monoxide (CO) C — Carbon dioxide (CO2). (ii) Carbon (or A) has atomic number 6. Its electronic configuration is 2, 4. It is present in 14th group of the periodic table."
1,"Q. 2. A metal X left in moist air for a longer time, loses its shiny brown surface and gains a green coat. Why has this happened ? Name and give the chemical formula of this given coloured compound and identify the metal. List two ways to prevent this process. [Board Term-I, Set (41) 2012] 3","Ans. The metal has corroded because of being exposed to moist air. Green compound is basic copper carbonate [CuCO3. Cu(OH)2] The metal is copper. Two ways to prevent this process : Painting, Greasing, Oiling, Galvanizing (Any two)"
2,"Q. 3. Giving one example of each. Explain the method of obtaining the following metals from their compounds. Metal ‘A’ — Which is low in the activity series. Metal ‘B’ — Which is in the middle in the activity 		series. Metal ‘C’ — Which is towards the top of the 		 activity series. [Board Term-I, Set (12) 2012] 3",Ans. (i) By heating the Ore/Oxide Heat → Hg + SO2 HgS + O2  (ii) By heating the oxide in the presence of a reducing agent like coke ZnO + C → Zn + CO (iii) By the electrolysis of molten compound. 2 NaCl → 2Na + Cl2 (molten)
3,"Q. 4. An alkali metal A gives a compound B (Molecular mass = 40) on reacting with water. The compound B gives a soluble compound C on treatment with aluminium oxide. Identify A, B and C and give the reactions involved.  3","Ans. Let the atomic weight of alkali metal A be x. When it reacts with water, it forms a compound B having molecular mass 40. Let the reaction be. 2A + 2H2O → 2AOH + H2 ↑ (B) According to the question, x + 16 + 1 = 40 x = 40 – 17 x = 23 [23 is the atomic weight of sodium (Na)] Therefore, the alkali metal (A) is Na and the reaction is — 2Na + 2H2O → 2NaOH(aq) + H2 (g) So, compound B is sodium hydroxide (NaOH) Sodium hydroxide reacts with aluminium oxide (Al2O3) to give sodium aluminate (NaAlO2). Thus, C is sodium aluminate (NaAlO2). The reaction involved is — Al2O3 + 2NaOH → 2NaAlO2 + H2O 1 + 1 + 1"
4,"Q. 5. P, Q and R are 3 elements which undergo chemical reactions according to the following equations — (a) P2O3 + 2Q → Q2O3 + 2P (b) 3RSO4 + 2Q → Q2 (SO4)3 + 3R (c) 3RO + 2P → P2O3 + 3R  Answer the following : (i) Which element is more reactive ? (ii) Which element is least reactive ? (iii) State the type of reaction listed above.",Ans. (i) Most reactive metal is Q as it has replaced both P and R from their compounds. (ii) Element R is least reactive as it has been replaced by both R and Q. (iii) Displacement reaction.
