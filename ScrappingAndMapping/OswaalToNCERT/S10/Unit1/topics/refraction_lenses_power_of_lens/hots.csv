An object is placed between two plane mirrors inclined at an angle θ with each other. What is the total number of images formed ?,"If θ is a submultiple of 180°, then the number of images formed. n= θ 		If θ is not a submultiple of 180°, then the number of images formed is the integer next higher than 				 θ"
Lemon kept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be larger in size than its actual size. Give reason. 3,"This is due to refraction of light. Ray of light travelling from air to water, undergoes bending and then reflection at the lemon’s surface. As a result it appears larger to the observer."
"An object is placed at a distance of 30 cm from a convex mirror, the magnification produced is . Where should the object be placed to get a magnification of","Given : Using u = 30 cm, m = m = -v u (For convex spherical mirror) LIGHT–REFLECTION AND REFRACTION -v = v = + 15 cm 		Also for spherical mirror f v u f Again Using again, f = + 30 cm m’ = ν1 u1 ν1 - u1 = – 1 v' = u f v u u u u u = 30 × –2 				 = – 60 cm. 		Hence, object should be placed at a distance of 60 cm in front of convex mirror to get a magnification"
"How will you distinguish between a plane, concave and convex mirrors without touching them ?","We will look our face in each mirror, turn by turn. (i) If the image formed is of same size as our face but laterally inverted for all positions, then it is a plane mirror. (ii) If the image formed is erect and enlarged initially but gets inverted as the face is moved away, then it is a concave mirror. (iii) If the image formed is erect and smaller in size for all positions, then it is a convex mirror."
"(i) What is the angle of incidence, when a ray of light falls on a spherical mirror from its centre of curvature ? (ii) Two concave mirror have the same focal length but the aperture of one is larger than the other. Which mirror forms the sharper image and why ? (iii) A convex mirror is held in water. What change you will observe in its focal length ?",(i) Such a ray falls normally on the mirror. So its angle of incidence is 0°. (ii) The concave mirror with smaller aperture forms the sharper image because it is free from spherical aberration. of (iii) No change. The focal length of a convex mirror does not depend on the nature of the medium. 1
On what factors does the refractive index of medium depend ?,The refractive index of a medium depends on : (i) Nature of the medium. (ii) Nature of the surrounding medium. (iii) Wavelength of light used. (iv) Temperature. (Any three) 3
Two thin lenses of power + 3.5 D and –2.5D are placed in contact. Find the power and focal length of the lens combination.,"P1 = + 3.5 D,P2 = –2.5 D 			Total Power (P) = P1 + P2 				 = 3.5 – 2.5 = 1 dioptre. 		Focal length of combination cm = 100 cm 		Focal length (f) = 100 cm"
"The image of a candle flame placed at a distance of 45 cm from a spherical lens is formed on a screen placed at a distance of 90 cm from the lens. Identify the type of lens and calculate its focal length. If the height of the flame is 2 cm, find the height of the image.","Nature of Spherical lens = Convex Given u = –45 cm, v = + 90 cm, h1 = + 2 cm Using lens formula f u v f = + 30 cm h2 v Again m = h1 u h2 = v × h1 u × 2 = –4 cm So, height of image is –4 cm. Negative sign indicates that it is formed below the principal axis."
