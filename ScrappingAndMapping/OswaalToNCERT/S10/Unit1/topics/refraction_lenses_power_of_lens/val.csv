0,"Q. 1. Nature of image formed by mirrors depends on the nature of the mirror and the position of the object in some cases. In a single array, one can make mirrors of various nature. A universal mirror, an object that reflects all light waves back at their source, has been created by scientists in Europe and Asia. Unlike an ordinary mirror, which reflects object at 90 degrees, a universal mirror reflects object back at any angle. A mirror may be flat or curved. Flat mirrors are the most common types of mirror that we have while curved mirrors either magnify or minimize an object on focus. (i) How reflection takes place in mirrors ? (ii) Estimate the values or importance of mirrors used by people around you.","Ans. (i) When light falls on a surface and gets back into the same medium, it is called reflection. A highly polished surface or mirror reflects the light. (ii) (a) Concave mirrors are used as shaving mirrors and in headlights of automobiles. (b) Convex mirror are used as rear-view mirrors in vehicles. (c) Plane mirrors are used to see our virtual image."
1,"Q. 2. A girl was playing with a thin beam of light from her laser torch by directing it from different directions on a convex lens held vertically. She was surprised to see that in a particular direction the beam of light continues to move along the same direction after passing through the lens. (i) State the reason for this observation. (ii) If white light source is used with (a) parallel, (b) non-parallel sides, record your observations. 2","Ans. (i) Reason is lateral displacement. Lateral displacement depends upon thickness of the slab, the incident and refraction angles. (ii) (a) If white light source is used with parallel side the ray will pass through the focus (b) Light rays will not pass through the nonparallel side."
2,"Q. 3. An aeroplane was flying over the Sahara desert. It was around 10 am, when the pilot noticed some fire in the engine of the plane and then he decided to land the plane in the desert. On landing, all the passengers de-boarded the plane and then within few seconds the whole plane was in fire. Now, the passengers are left with no help as there were no mobile signal to call for help too. After about 2 hrs, they saw a plane passing over. They all shouted but was of no use because of the sound of plane. Then one person got an idea. He asked for a mirror. Then a young lady said that she had a mirror. He took it and with the help of the light coming from the search and rescue plane, he reflected them back so as to get revealed their position and thus, saved the life of all the co-passengers. (i) State the laws of phenomenon, he used to save the lives of all the co-passengers ? (ii) What moral values do we get from this passage ? Write any two only.","Ans. (i) Phenomenon used by the person is reflection of light. Laws of reflection are : (a) The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. (b) The incident ray, the normal at the point of incidence on the mirror and the reflected ray, all lie on the same plane. (ii) (a) Presence of mind (b) High degree of general awareness 		(c) Ability to take prompt decision (d) Concern for other passengers."
3,"Q. 4. Two fast friends named Sita and Gita spend most of the time with each other. One day Gita observed that Sita is having pain in gums while eating her school lunch. Gita’s father is a dentist so she advised, Sita to come with her to her father’s clinic. Gita’s father examines Sita’s mouth and teeth with the help of a mirror and light and advises her not to eat too many chocolates and soft drinks. She also starts taking care of her mouth as she washed her mouth properly after having every food and also started taking a calcium rich diet. (i) Which type of mirror is used by the dentist ? (ii) Name the phenomenon of light by which doctor is able to examine Sita. (iii) What values are shown by doctor, his daughter and his daughter’s friend ?",Ans. (i) Concave mirror (ii) Reflection of light (iii) (a) Friendship (b) Concern for each other (c) Helping nature (d) Right choices
4,"Q. 5. When light enters from one medium into another, we say refraction takes place. Light bends on undergoing refraction, when light enters from rarer medium into denser medium, it will bend towards the normal. Similarly, when light gets into rarer medium from a denser medium, it will bend away from the normal. (i) State the laws of Refraction. (ii) ‘Due to refraction, the original depth of a tank cannot be known’. Give any three examples of effects of refraction in support of the statement. 2","Ans. (i) Laws of refraction : (a) The incident ray, the normal and the refracted ray, all lie in same plane. (b) The ratio of sine of the angle of incidence and sine of the angle of refraction is constant. Which is called refractive index. (ii) Three examples of refraction : (a) A coin placed at the bottom of glass tumbler appears to be raised. (b) Pencil immersed in water appears to be bent when viewed from sides. (c) Lemon kept in water bowl appears to be larger. LIGHT–REFLECTION AND REFRACTION"
