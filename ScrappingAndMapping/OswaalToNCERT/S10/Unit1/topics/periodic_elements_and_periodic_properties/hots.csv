How do the early attempts to classify the chemical elements differ from the modern attempt ? Which of the two is better and why ? Give examples.,"The early attempts to classify elements were made on the basis of atomic masses of the elements. Modern basis is the atomic number. This is better because now it is established that atomic number of an element is the fundamental property. Further there are certain anomalies in Mendeleev’s periodic table such as the position of isotopes and misplacements of certain elements, e.g. Argon is placed (Atomic mass - 40, atomic number = 18) before potassium in Mendeleev’s periodic table (Atomic mass = 39, At. no = 19)."
What are metalloids ? How many electrons can be present in the valency shell of their atoms ? In what part of the periodic table these are located ? What type of oxide are formed by these elements ?,"Metalloids are elements which resemble both metals and non-metals. The valency shell of metalloids contain 3, 4, 5, 6 elements starting from periods 2 to 5 respectively. They are found on the right side of the table in the zig-zag column, e.g., boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic etc. They form amphoteric oxides."
What is electronegativity ? How it is different from electron affinity ?,Though both electronegativity and electron affinity refer to the attraction of electron but are used in different context. Electronegativity refers to the attraction of bonding electron or shared pair of electron whereas electron affinity refers to the attraction of electron by an isolated gaseous atoms. filled from group 1 to group 18 and the shell does not change.
What is the basic difference between a group and a period in terms of electronic configuration ?,"In a group, though the number of shells increases as we move downward, but the number of electrons in the outermost shell remains the same. In a period, as we move from left to right, the outermost shell or valence shell gets progressively"
"An element ‘X’ is liquid, non-metallic. Can you predict its position in the periodic table ?","As the element ‘X’ is non-metallic, it may be belonging to group 17. In group 17, first two elements are gases. Metallic character of elements (non-metals) increases on moving down the group. Therefore, the element ‘X’ may be located in group 17 and 3rd or 4th period of the periodic table."
"Given below are the melting points and atomic radii of three elements X, Y and Z of the periodic table having ‘n’ electrons in the outermost shells of their atoms — Melting point (°C) Atomic radii (A°) State four inference that can be drawn about the elements on the basis of the above data.","(i) Since each element contains the same number of valence electrons, n in the outermost shells of their atoms, therefore X, Y and Z, belong to the same group. (ii) The atomic radii increase from X to Z so metallic character increases from X towards Z. (iii) X, Y and Z have melting points above 25°C (room temperature). Therefore X, Y and Z are solid at room temperature. (iv) The ionization potential decreases from X to Z because they belong to the same group in the descending order."
