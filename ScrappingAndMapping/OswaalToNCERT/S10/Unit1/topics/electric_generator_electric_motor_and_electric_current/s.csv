Explain the terms : Overloading and short- circuiting. ,"Overloading occurs when or two many appliances of high power ratings are connected to a single electric circuit and switched on simultaneously. As a result, the circuit draws large current beyond its capacity. Short-circuiting takes place in domestic power supply if the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact, due to damage of insulation of live wire.  1+1"
When does Short Circuit occurs ?,"A common short circuit occurs when the positive and negative terminals of a battery are connected with a low-resistance conductor, like a wire. With a low resistance in the connection, a high current will flow, causing the delivery of a large amount of energy in a short period of time."
"What is a solenoid ? Mention two ways to increase the strength of the field of a solenoid. [Board Term I, Set (37), 2012]",A coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wire wrapped closely in the shape of cylinder is called a solenoid. Two ways to increase the strength of the field of a solenoid : (i) By increasing the number of turns. (ii) By increasing current.  ()
"Mention the provision of two different current ratings in our domestic circuits. Explain with reason, the advantage of such a provision. ","The two different current ratings provided in domestic circuits are 5A and 15A. This is because different electrical appliances have different power ratings, so they draw different currents when connected in the mains. Some appliances need smaller currents, while some other need heavy currents.  2"

Explain the function of an earth wire. Why is it necessary to earth metallic appliances ? ,"Earth wire is used as a safety measure especially for those appliances that have a metallic body, for example – electric press, toaster etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which provides a low resistance conducting path for the current.

List two precautions to be taken to avoid overloading in the domestic circuit. Also state one difference between overloading and short circuiting. ,Precautions : (i) A fuse of appropriate rating should be used in the circuit. (ii) Too many appliances should never be connected to a single socket.

Short circuiting : Occurs when the live wire comes in direct contact with neutral wire. 
What is overloading and short circuiting ? What is the function of earth wire ?  ,"If too many electrical appliances of high power rating are switched on at the same time, they draw large current from the circuit. This is called overloading. If the live wire and neutral wire come in contact either directly or via conducting wire, the situation is called short circuiting. To avoid risk of electrical shock, the metal body of the appliances is earthed. Earthing means to connect the metal case of the appliance to earth by a means of a metal wire called earth wire. 1 + 1 + 1"

Factor – Insulation of wire is damaged / fault appliance. Safety device – electric fuse. in in in () Electric fuse is an application of Joule’s heating. If there is a current larger than the specified value the temperature of fuse wire increases and it melts to break the electric circuit and stop the flow of unduly high electric current. "
What is short-circuiting of an electric circuit ? An electric motor of 1.5 kW power rating is operated in a domestic electric circuit of current rating 5A. What would happen when it is switched ON ?

Hence the fuse will melt and the electric motor will stop working.  1"
What is earth wire ? How it works in our domestic circuit ? ,"The earth wire gives a safe route for the current if the live wire touches the outer casing. Live wire is A wire carrying electric current. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which provides a low resistance-conducting path for the current. It ensures that any leakage of current of the metallic body the appliance will flow to the earth only and the user may not get a severe shock."

(b) (i) Too many appliances should not be connected to a single socket. (ii) Fuse of current rating 5A and 15A should be separately used in the domestic circuit. 
"What is the role of fuse, used in series with any electrical appliance ? Why should a fuse with defined rating not be replaced by one with a larger rating ? ","Fuse is used for protecting appliances due to shortcircuiting or overloading. The fuse is rated for a certain maximum current and blows off when a current more than the rated value flows through it. If a fuse is replaced by one with larger ratings, the appliances may get damaged while the protecting fuse does not burn off. This practice of using fuse of improper rating should always be avoided."

Here, P = 2000 W, V = 220 V Using P = VI P 2000 I= = 9.09 A. V 220 Since the current flowing through the oven is larger than the fuse rating (5A), the fuse wire melts and breaks the circuit, thus protecting the circuit.  1"
Distinguish between alternating current and direct current. Explain why alternating current is preferred over direct current for transmission over long distances. ,"Alternating Current : If the current changes direction after equal intervals of time, it is called alternating current. The positive and negative polarities of AC are not fixed. Direct Current : If the current always flows in the same direction, it is called direct current. It can be obtained from a cell or a battery. The positive and negative polarities of DC are fixed for long distance transmission. AC is preferred as it caused minimum loss of energy during transmission."

It is necessary to connect an earth wire to electric appliances having metallic covers. Why? How will you identify earth wire in household circuit ? ,"The earth wire provides a low resistance conducting path for the current. In case of any leakage of current to the metallic body of any appliance, the earth wire allows the current to flow into the earth and user saved from electric shock. Earth wire has green insulation.  Detailed Answer : The earth wire is connected to a metallic plate deep inside the earth. In this way, the metallic body of appliance is connected to the earth, which provides a low resistance conducting path for electric current. Hence, any leakage of current to the metallic body of appliance keeps the potential to that of earth. The user might not get a severe electric shock on touching such an appliance. Earth wire has green insulation, so it can be identified."
