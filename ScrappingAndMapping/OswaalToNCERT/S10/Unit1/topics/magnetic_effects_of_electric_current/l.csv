Insert the thick wire through the centre, normal to the plane of a rectangular cardboard. Take care that the cardboard is fixed and does not slide up or down. Connect the copper wire vertically between the points X and Y, in series with the battery, a plug and key. Sprinkle some iron filings uniformly on the cardboard. Keep the variable of the rheostat at a fixed position and note the current through ammeter. Close the key, So that current flows through the wire. Ensure that the copper wire placed between the points X and Y remains vertically straight. Gently tap the cardboard for a few times. Observe the pattern of the iron filings. You would find that the iron filings align themselves showing a pattern of concentric circles around the copper wire. This represents the magnetic field around the currentcarrying conductor.

(iv) How does strength of magnetic field is indicates ?  5,"(i) Due to the force exerted by the magnet within its magnetic field. (ii) The lines represent magnetic field lines. (iii) Crowding of iron filings at the ends of the magnet indicates that the magnetic field is strongest near the poles of the magnet.
