Again the plants act as a food for the primary consumers and then by secondary and third consumers."
18,"Q. 17. In the food chain : Grass → deer → lion Operating in a forest, what will happen if all the : Producer",Ans. Z — Tertiary consumers X — Primary consumers 
19,Q. 21. Discuss the feeding patterns in a food web.,"Ans. In a food web, each organism is generally eaten by two or more other kinds of organisms which in turn are eaten by several other organisms. So, a food web is a complex network of many interconnected food chains and feeding relationships."
20,Q. 1. What is an ecosystem ? List its two main components. We do not clean natural ponds or lakes but an aquarium needs to be cleaned regularly. Why is it so ? Explain. ,"Ans. Ecosystem is the structural and functional unit of biosphere, comprising of all the interacting organisms in an area together with the non–living constituents of the environment. Two main components of Ecosystem are : (i) Biotic component (ii) Abiotic component An aquarium is an artificial and incomplete ecosystem compared to pond or lakes which are natural, self–sustaining and complete ecosystem where there is a perfect recycling of materials. We need to clean of aquarium because of the : (i) absence of natural decomposer. (ii) stagnancy of water."
21,Q. 2. What are biotic factors ? Give any two examples.,Ans. Biotic factors are the living components of the environment which interact with each other as well as with the abiotic factors of the ecosystem. Example : Plants and animals.
22,Q. 3. What is meant by food chain ? “The number of tropic levels in a food chain is limited.” Give reason to justify this statement. ,"Ans. Food chain is a simple representation of energy flow in nature. For example : A rat eats grains,a snake eats a rat,which in turn, is eaten by an eagle. In a food chain, the number of trophic levels are limited to 4-5. This is because according to 10% law of energy transfer, only 10% of energy passes from one trophic level to next. Thus the amount of energy decreases with successive trophic levels. After five trophic levels, existence of organisms would become impossible with such negligible amount of energy."
23,Q. 4. Explain the phenomenon of ‘Biological Magnification’. How does it affect organisms belonging to different trophic levels particularly the tertiary consumers ?,Ans. Biological magnification refers to the process of increase in the concentration of a toxic chemical with increasing trophic level in a food chain. Harmful or poisonous substance such as DDT sprinkled to kill pests on plants enter the food chain. The plants absorb these harmful chemicals from soil along with water and minerals. They enter the food chain at producer level and then transfers to the next trophic level. The tertiary consumers get more higher levels of these chemicals.
24,Q. 5. Define Ecosystem. Briefly describe the two types of ecosystem. (3 marks each),"Ans. Ecosystem is the structural and functional unit of biosphere, comprising of all the interacting organisms in an area together with the non-living constituents of the environment. Ecosystem are of two types : (i) Natural Ecosystem : The natural ecosystems are terrestrial (land) as well as aquatic. The common example of land ecosystem are forest, grassland, desert, etc. The common examples of aquatic ecosystem are ponds, lakes, rivers, ocean, etc. (ii) Human made or Artificial Ecosystem : These ecosystems are made by human beings. The common examples are crop fields, gardens, parks, aquarium, etc."
25,Q. 6. What are consumers ? Name the four categories into which the consumers are further grouped. ,"Ans. Organisms that feed directly or indirectly on producers and cannot synthesize their own food from inorganic sources are called consumers. Herbivores, Carnivores, Omnivores and Parasites are various categories of consumers."
26,Q. 7. What are trophic levels ? Give an example of a food chain and state the different trophic levels in it.,"Ans. Trophic levels are different steps of a food chain. A trophic level is the level of species in an ecosystem on the basis of the source of nutrition such as producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers etc. The producers form the first trophic level as they manufacture food. The primary consumers form the second trophic level, the secondary consumers form the third, and the tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level. Terrestrial food chain : 		 Grass Deer Lion 		(Producer) (Herbivore)		(Carnivore) 		1st Trophic level 2nd Trophic level 3rd Trophic level 1"
27,Q. 8. Why there is a progressive decline in the amount of energy at each trophic level ?,"Ans. At every trophic level, large amount of energy is lost in form of heat for maintaining metabolic activities and lost as heat. The amount of heat lost is generally 90 percent and the amount of energy retained is available from previous trophic level to the next. The decline in energy level leads to : (i) Lesser number of organisms in each trophic level.½ (ii) Limited number of trophic level in food chains. ½"
28,Q. 9. Mention any three significance of a food chain.,Ans. Significance of a food chain : (i) It helps in understanding the food relationship and interactions among various organisms in an ecosystem. (ii) It helps in following the basic mechanism of transfer of food energy and nutrients through various components of nature. (ii) The harmful by-products are gases such as SO2 and NO2. They cause extensive air pollution and are responsible for acid rain. (iii) It helps to understand the movement of toxic substances in an ecosystem and the problem of their biological magnification. (iii) Crop fields are man-made and some biotic and abiotic components are manipulated by humans. 1
29,"Q. 13. “Our food grains such as wheat and rice, the vegetables and fruits and even meat are found to contain varying amounts of pesticide residues.” State the reason to explain how and why it happens ?   ","Ans. (i) In a food chain the energy moves progressively through the various trophic levels and is no longer available to the organisms of the previous trophic level/ energy captured by the autotrophs does not revert back to the solar input. (ii) Pesticides used for crop protection when washed away/down into the soil/water bodies absorbed by plants/ producers. (iii) On consumption they enter our food chain and being non-biodegradable, these chemicals get accumulated progressively and enter our body. 1 "
30,Q. 14. Why is only 10% of energy made available to the next trophic level when green plants are eaten by herbivores ?  (ii) Flow of energy in a food chain is unidirectional. ,"Ans. (i) The existence of decomposers is essential in a biosphere because they breakdown complex organic substances into simple inorganic substances that can be absorbed by the plants. Thus, decomposer : 		(a) replenish the soil naturally (b) helps in removing the biodegradable waste. (ii) In a food chain the energy moves progressively through the various trophic levels, it is no longer available to the previous level (autotrophs) and the energy captured by the autotrophs does not go back to the solar input. Hence, the flow of energy is unidirectional. "
31,"Q. 12. (i) We do not clean ponds or lakes, but an aquarium needs to be cleaned. Why ?  (ii) What are the harmful by-products of fertilizers industries ? How do they affect the environment  ? (iii) Why are crop ecosystem ? fields known as artificial ","Ans. When green plants are eaten by herbivores, a great deal of energy is lost in the form of heat to the environment. Some amount goes into digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth and reproduction. The remaining is only an average of 10% of the food eaten that is turned into its own body and made available for the next level of consumers."
32,"Q. 15. Calculate the amount of energy available to lion in the following food chain if plants have 20,000 J of energy available from the sun. Plant → Deer → Lion","Ans. According to 10% Law, Plants have 20,000 J energy available. Plants transferred their 10% energy to deer i.e. = 2000 J 		Deer received 2000 J energy from the plants and now it transfer 10% energy of itself to lion. = 200 J Hence, lion will have 200 J energy from deer."
