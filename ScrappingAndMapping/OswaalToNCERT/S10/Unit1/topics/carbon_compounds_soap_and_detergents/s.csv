"What is the difference between the molecules of soaps and detergents, chemically ? Explain the cleansing action of soaps. ","Detergents are sodium salt of long chain benzene sulphonic acids. Soaps are sodium or potassium salt of long chain fatty acids that have cleaning action in water. e.g., Sodium stearate. Cleansing Action of Soap : A soap molecule consists of two dissimilar parts : (i) A short ionic part comprising the carboxylate salt-COO–Na+ which is water soluble. (ii) A long hydrocarbon chain which is hydrophobic. When soap is dissolved in water, it forms a colloidal suspension. In this colloidal suspension, the soap molecules cluster together to form micelles and remain radially suspended in water with the hydrocarbon end towards the centre and the ionic end directed outward. The dirt particles always adhere to the oily or greasy layer present on the skin or clothes. When a dirty cloth is dipped into a soap solution, its non-polar hydrocarbon end of micelles gets attached to the grease or oil present in dirt and polar end remains in water layer. The mechanical action of rubbing subsequently, dislodges the oily layer from the dirty surface shaping it into small globules. A stable emulsion of oil in water is formed. The emulsified oil or grease globules bearing the dirt can now be readily washed with water. "

"Draw the electron dot structure of ethyne. A mixture of ethyne and oxygen is burnt for welding . In your opinion, why cannot we use a mixture of ethyne and air for this purpose.  + R'OH  NaOH","In pure oxygen, ethyne undergoes complete combustion and high temperature suitable for welding is attained. Whereas air contains less percentage/amount of oxygen which results in incomplete combustion of ethyne and the temperature required for welding is not attained.  Detailed Answer : Electron dot structure of ethyne — No, the mixture of ethyne and air cannot be used for welding because when ethyne is burnt in air, it gives a sooty flame. This is due to incomplete combustion caused by limited supply of air. However, if ethyne is burnt with oxygen, it gives a clean flame with temperature 3000°C because of complete combustion. This oxy-acetylene flame is used for welding. It is not possible to attain such a high temperature without mixing oxygen."
