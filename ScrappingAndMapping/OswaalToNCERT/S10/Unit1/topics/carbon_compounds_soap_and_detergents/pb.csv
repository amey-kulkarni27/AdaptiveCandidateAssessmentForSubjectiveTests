The two properties of acetic acid can be used to identify acetic acid in the test tube, containing acetic acid and water are: Acetic acid reacts with NaHCO3 and the colour change with universal indicator. 2"
11,Q. 13. Write the reaction between soap molecules and ions present in hard water.,Ans. Ca(HCO3)2 (aq) + 2Na+—stearate (aq) ↓ → Ca(stearate)2 (s) + 2NaHCO3 (aq) CaSO4 (aq) + 2Na+ – stearate (aq)↓ → Ca(stearate)2 (s) + Na2SO4(aq) 1+1
12,Q. 14. Is a sample containing dil. HCl hard ? Why ?,Ans. Yes. Hydrogen ions provided by HCl makes water hard. H+ + Na+ stearate- → Steric acid + Na+
13,"Q. 15. While studying saponification reaction for the prep­ aration of soap, a teacher suggested to a student to add a small quantity of common salt to the reaction mixture. Write down the function of common salt in this reac­tion?","Ans. Common salt is added in saponification reaction, as it helps in the precipitation of soap by decreasing the solubility of soap."
14,"Q. 16. While studying saponification reaction, a student measures the temperature of the reaction mixture and also finds its nature using blue/red litmus paper. What conclusion can be drawn from his observations?","Ans. Saponification reaction is a highly exothermic reaction. The reaction mixture of this reaction is basic in nature and hence, this will turn red litmus blue."
15,"Q. 17. On the basis of study of saponification reactions, a group of students noted down the following com­ ments in their notebooks: (i) The nature of the reaction mixture is basic. (ii) In saponification reactions, heat is evolved. (iii) Saponification reaction is not a neutralization reaction. (iv) Soap is nothing but a salt of fatty acids.

(iii) Soap is nothing but a salt of fatty acids."
16,"Q. 18. When the red litmus paper and the blue litmus pa­ per are dipped into the soap solution, what colour changes, will you observe?","Ans. Red litmus paper turn blue and blue litmus pa­ per remains colourless, as soap solution is basic in nature."

Next, he then adds 10 drops of soap solution to each test tube and shakes its contents. In which of these test tubes the scum (insoluble substance) is formed with soap?","Ans. Scum is formed by reaction of soap with calcium and magnesium salts in water. Test-tubes R and S contain calcium chloride and magnesium chloride, respectively. Therefore, scum will be formed in these two test-tubes."
24,Q. 26. A student puts a drop of reaction mixture of a saponification reaction first on a blue litmus paper and then on a red litmus paper. Write down the observation he will observe?,Ans. There is no change in blue litmus paper as soap solution is alkaline in nature.
25,"Q. 27. During saponification reaction, Rupal takes refined oil in a test-tube and adds 20% NaOH solution. She then stirs the reacting mixture. Write down the observation she will observe?",Ans. She will observe that soap settles down in the testtube.
26,Q. 28. Do soaps create water pollution? Give reason in support of your answer?,"Ans. No, because soaps are biodegradable."
27,Q. 29. Take a test-tube and put soap and water and shake it for 10 times by placing thumb on its mouth. What will you observe?,"Ans. When you put soap and water in a test tube and shake it well for 10 times by placing thumb on its mouth, it will form foam."
