0,Q. 1. Ravi read the formation of covalent bonds and came to know the property of carbon. Carbon has four valence electrons. It cannot lose four electrons since very high amount of energy will be required to lose four electrons to form C4+. Carbon cannot gain four electrons to form C4– ion as six protons cannot hold 10 electrons easily and there will be strong interelectronic repulsion (i) What is the atomic number and electronic configuration of carbon ? (ii) Explain how covalent bonding is important between carbon compounds. Give any two suggestions.  2,"Ans. (i) Atomic number of carbon = 6. Electronic configuration of carbon = 2, 4. (ii) (a) Carbon forms maximum number of compounds due to covalent bonding. (b) Carbon compounds have covalent bonds due to which they are poor conductors of electricity. They do not contain ions or free electrons to conduct electricity."
