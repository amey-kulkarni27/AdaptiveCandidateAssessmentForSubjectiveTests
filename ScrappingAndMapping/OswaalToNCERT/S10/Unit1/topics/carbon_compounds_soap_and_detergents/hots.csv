0,"Q. 1. What are the properties of carbon that lead to the formation of fullerenes. Name two other compounds which are allotropes. In which of these compounds, all the four valencies are satisfied ? 3","Ans. Tetravalency and catenation are the properties of carbon that gives the formation of fullerenes. Because of these properties, carbon forms two allotropes-diamond and graphite, out of which, all the four valencies of carbon are satisfied in diamond."
1,Q. 2. Give reasons : (i) Why is pure ethanoic acid known as glacial acetic acid ? (ii) Why is ethanol used as antifreeze ? (iii) Why is ethanol mixed with methanol known as denatured alcohol ? (iv) Why is oxyacetylene flame used for welding purposes ? (v) What is gasol ?,"Ans. (i) Pure ethanoic acid has a low freezing point. It freezes and looks like glaciers. (ii) Ethanol mixed with water freezes at temperatures lower than water. Thus a mixture of water and ethanol is used in radiators of cars in cold countries. (iii) When methanol is mixed with ethanol, the latter becomes undrinkable. (iv) Acetylene mixed with oxygen burns giving large amount of heat which is used for welding purposes. (v) Gasol is a mixture of petrol and alcohol."
2,"Q. 3. Two compounds ‘A’ and ‘B’ have the same molecular formula C3H6O2. One of them reacts with sodium metal and NaHCO3 to liberate H2 gas and a gas ‘C’, respectively. ‘C’ turns lime water milky. The other compound does not react with either Na metal or NaHCO3 but undergoes saponification to give sodium salt of a carboxylic acid and wood spirit, 'D’. Identify A, B, C and D.","Ans. Two possible compounds with molecular formula C3H6O2 are propanoic acid (CH3CH2COOH) and methyl acetate (CH3COOCH3). Propanoic acid reacts with Na metal to give sodium propanoate and H2 gas and with NaHCO3, it gives CO2 gas which turns lime water milky. Methyl acetate on saponification gives sodium acetate and wood spirit i.e., methanol. Thus, A is propanoic acid B is methyl acetate C is carbon dioxide D is methanol."
3,"Q. 4. An organic compound ‘A’ with molecular formula C2H6O gives compound ‘B’ on oxidation with alkaline KMnO4. ‘A’ an heating with conc. H2SO4 gives ‘C’ which on reaction with phosphoric acid and water gives back ‘A’. Compound ‘C’ gives addition product with Br2 and H2. Identify A, B, C and write chemical equations involved.","Ans. Since C gives addition reaction with Br2 and H2 and so it is unsaturated hydrocarbon. It gives an alcohol with phosphoric acid and water i.e., CH3CH2OH. So C is ethene. Thus, A is ethanol which on oxidation with alkaline KMnO4 gives ethanoic acid. So we can conclude that A is ethanol, B is ethanoic acid and C is ethene.
