Why did Mendel choose pea plant for his experiments.  3,Mendel selected peas for his experiments because : (i) Many varieties are available with observable contrasting characteristic or trait. (ii) Peas are normally self pollinated and the flower structure is suitable for cross-pollination. 1½+1½
"Why is variation beneficial for the species, but not necessarily for the individual ?","Accumulation of variation in a species enables them to adapt according to the changes and the new needs. This provide survival advantage to the species. But an individual does not get any advantage due to variation that takes place on him Thus, variation is beneficial for a species, but not necessary for the individual."
Describe briefly four ways in which individuals with a particular trait may increase in a population.,The four ways in which individuals with a particular trait may increase in a population are as follows : (i) Sexual reproduction results into variations. (ii) The individuals with special traits survive the attack of their predators and multiply while the other will perish. (iii) Genetic drift provides diversity without any adaptations. (iv) Variations in the species may lead to increased survival of the individuals.
"A study found that children with light - coloured eyes are likely to have parents with light - coloured eyes. On this basis, can we say anything about whether the light eye colour trait is dominant or recessive ? Why or why not ?",We can say that light eyes colour trait is dominant because only dominant traits are transferred from the parents to the children in the first generation. 3
Explain with an example how traits get expressed ?,"DNA is the source of information for making proteins in the cell. The section of DNA is called gene. For example, the height of a plant depends on the hormone. The amount of hormone depends on the process of its formation. A protein is important for this process. If this protein works efficiently a lot of hormone will be made. If the gene responsible for that protein has an alteration, this will make the protein less efficient. The amount of hormone will be less and the plant will be short. Thus, traits get expressed."
Define genetics. What is the contribution of Mendel in this branch of biology ?,"The science of heredity and variation is called genetics. Mendel conducted breeding experiments in a garden pea plant (Pisum sativum) with two different contrasting characters. He found that only one character appeared in first generation but both the characters reappeared in the subsequent generation. On the basis of results of his experiments, he put forward the various principles of inheritance. He also suggested that each character of pea plant is controlled by ‘factor’."
(a) Write the similarities between mode of transmission of ‘factor’ from parents to offspring as conceived by Mendel and chromosomes through gametes. (b) What were the three main steps adopted by Mendel for his breeding experiments ?,"(a) (i) Both Mendelian factors, which are now known as genes and chromosomes are found in pairs. 		(ii) Both segregate at the time of gamete formation, during meiotic cell division. 		(iii) The paired condition is again restored after fertilization. (b) (i) Selection of a pure plant. 		(ii) Production of first generation plants (hybrids) by cross-pollination between the two varieties. 		(iii) Raising of second and subsequent generation by self-fertilization of hybrids."
State and describe in brief any three main factors responsible for the rise of a new species.,"Factors responsible for rise of a new species are : (i) Genetic drift : Over generation, genetic drift may accumulate which lead to the formation of a new species. (ii) Natural selection : Due to natural selection, variation may occur which lead to the formation of a new species. (iii) DNA change : Variation during DNA copying often lead to the formation of a new species. (Any two) 3"
List three roles of fossils in tracing evolutionary relationships.,"(i) Fossils and their study is useful in knowing about the species which are no longer alive. (ii) They provide evidence and missing links between two classes. (iii) They are helpful in forming a sequence of organisms in the pathway of evolution. Thus, fossils have an importance in deciding evolutionary relationship. 3"
What is the significance of homologous and analogous organs in the process of evolution ? 5,"The significance of homologous and analogous organs in the process of evolution are as follows : (i) The existence of homologous anatomical structures implies a common evolutionary origin of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals from same ancient fish ancestor. (ii) The homologous structures seen in successive generations indicate relationship and their possessors are the diverse descendants of common ancestry. They point to evolution and divergence from the ancestral type. (iii) Analogous organs have arisen in the evolutionary process through adaptation of different organisms to a similar mode of life."
How do you call in short the Lamarck’s theory of evolution ? Who disapproved it initially and how ?,"Lamarck theory is called theory of inheritance of acquired characters. It says that the organisms are exposed to new needs due to a change in the environment. They acquire same characters during their lifetime to adapt themselves to the new needs. These characters are passed on to the next generation. For example, the long neck of giraffe is due to need to catch the leaves of long tress. A. Weismann rejected the theory of Lamarck, stating that adaptations based in the somatic cells cannot be inherited."
"All the human races like Africans, Asians, Europeans, Americans and other might have evolved from a common ancestor. Provide a few evidences in support of this view.  5",All the human races have evolved from a common ancestor because they possess : (i) Common body plan (ii) Common structure (iii) Common physiology (iv) Common metabolism (v) Constant chromosome number (vi) Common genetic blue–print (vii) Free inter–breeding (Any five)
