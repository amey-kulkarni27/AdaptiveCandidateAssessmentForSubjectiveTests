1,"Q. 2. Reproductive process gives rise to new individuals that are similar but with some variations. Thus, the similarities between parents and their offsprings are due to heredity and the dissimilarities are due to ‘variation’. Continuity of life is maintained through heredity and evolution. (i) What do you mean by variation ? (ii) Why is variation beneficial for the species, but not necessary for the individual ?",Ans. (i) Variation refers to the difference in the characters or traits among the individuals of a species. (ii) Variation enables the organisms to adapt themselves in changing environment. It form the basis of heredity. They form raw materials for evolution and development of new species.
2,"Q. 3. It is a disgrace for the Indian society which consider birth of a girl child as burden. This narrow view point of the Indian patriarchal society has lead to the horrified practice of female foeticide. Escalating demands for dowry is considered as the main reason behind it. Daughters are unable to provide social security to parents and are treated as unwanted commodities. Strict implementation of laws to stop female foeticide and dowry free and compulsory education for girls may help in eradicating this evil from the Indian society. Sex of a child depends on father but often mother is cursed in many societies for giving birth to a girl child. (i) Do you think laws prohibiting pre-natal sex determination should be strictly enforced. Comment on the statement. (ii) As a student, what initiative would you take in the common concern of ‘Sex of a child depends on the chromosome it inherits from father.’ Give any three suggestions.","Ans. (i) Yes, pre-natal sex-determination should be banned. The female-male sex ratio should be maintained for the benefit of society. (ii) Suggestions : (a) Dramas or plays to make awareness in the public. (b) Doctor’s camp to satisfy the confusions of the people. (c) Group discussion with people, about sex determination."
3,"Q. 4. While playing near a sugarcane field, Mohan noticed that the plants are almost similar to one another. At the same time, he noticed the mango trees in the next plot of land are not similar to one another. Mohan concluded there is little variation. Mango reproduces sexually, hence there is larger variation. (i) Why sugarcane cannot reproduce sexually ? (ii) Can mango reproduce asexually ? (iii) If a person wants to have a flower garden, what type of plants should he grow ?","Ans. (i) Because they do not bear flowers. (ii) Yes, by grafting and layering. (iii) Since, the flower garden will be ornamental in natural, the person should plant saplings which are obtained from the same parent asexually. This will give a uniform look to his garden."
4,"Q. 5. Fossils are the remains, traces or impression of the dead animals and plants of geological past. Fossils are formed layer by layer in the earth’s crust. Fossils of prokaryotes were found in older rocks than those of eukaryotes. Invertebrates were formed before vertebrates. Among vertebrates, fishes appeared earlier than amphibians and amphibians appeared earlier than reptiles, which are earlier than birds and mammals. Thus, fossils provide evidence for evolution. (i) What is the main factor on which formation of fossil depends ? (ii) What is fossil dating ? Why the study of fossils important ?",Ans. (i) Decomposition of organisms. (ii) The age of fossils can be estimated by fossil dating. 1 The study of fossils is important because : (i) It helps to analyse racial history of plants and animals. (ii) It helps to measure the geological time.
5,"Q. 6. Evolution is the change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms through successive generations. After a population splits into smaller groups, these groups evolve independently and diversity into new species. A hierarchy of anatomical and genetic similarities, geographical distribution of similar species and the fossil record indicate that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor. Laetoli is a site of Tanzania famous for its hominid (human and its fossil ancestors) footprints, preserved in volcanic ash. (i) What is the main reason for evolution according to Darwin ? (ii) ‘Both Human beings and chimpanzee have a common ancestor’. Justify the statement by giving reason behind the conclusion.",Ans. (i) Natural selection and generation of new species. (ii) (a) Changes due to genetic drift and natural selection will result in isolation of two subpopulation which become more and more different from each other. 		(b) Characters of the fossils also stated the characteristics of ancestors.
6,Q. 7. Darwin’s theory of ‘Survival of the fittest‘ states that only the fittest will survive. (i) How will you relate the Darwin’s theory to your day–to–day life ? (ii) How will you make yourself fit for a particular work?,"Ans. (i) ‘The Survival of the fittest’ theory teaches us that whatever work one does, he or she should do it in the best way. For example, one who play very well will only survive for long time in sports. One who sings consistently well can only survive in the singing field. (ii) To be fit for a work, we must practice it again and again. Practice will bring perfection in work."
