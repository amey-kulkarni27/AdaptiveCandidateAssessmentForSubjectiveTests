What is multiple fission ? How does it occur in an organism ? Explain briefly. Name one organism which exhibits this type of reproduction. ,"In multiple fission, the nucleus divides several times simultaneously or successively into a number of daughter nuclei and then the cytoplasm divides into as many cells as there are nuclei. It is the common form of asexual reproduction in certain acellular organisms. Plasmodium, Chlamydomonas, Algae (Any one)"
What is meant by speciation ? List four factors that could lead to speciation. Which of these cannot be a major factor in the speciation of a self-pollinating plant species. Give reason to justify your answer.  What is speciation ? List four factors that could lead to speciation. Which of these cannot be a major factor in the speciation of a selfpollinating plant species ? Explain. ,(i) Speciation : The process of formation of a new species from a pre-existing one. (ii) Four factors : Genetic drift Mutation / Drastic change in the genes or DNA Natural selection Geographical isolation (iii) Geographical isolation cannot be a major factor in the speciation of a self-pollinating plant species. 1 (iv) Reason : Physical barrier cannot be created in selfpollinating plants.
What is speciation ? What are the factors that lead to speciation ? Explain any two factors. ,"(a) It is an evolutionary process by which new species arise. Factors : 			(i) Geographical isolation 			(ii) Genetic drift 			(iii) Natural selection (b) (Any two with explanation) (i)		 Genetic Drift : It is the random change in the frequency of alleles in a population over successive generations due to sampling error in the gametes. Each new generation differs from its parental generation with regard to the allele frequencies simply because of random variation in the distribution of gametes. This process is more rapid in smaller population, hence genetic drift can cause less of genetic diversity if there are no counteracting factors. 1½ (ii)		 Natural Selection : It is the process, according to Darwin, which brings about the evolution of new species of animals and plants. Darwin found that variations existed between individuals of the population and concluded that disease, competition and other forces acting on the population eliminated those individuals which are less well adapted to their environment. The surviving population would pass the hereditary advantageous characteristic to their offsprings.  1½+1½"
(a) How does speciation take place ? (b) Define the term gene. (c) The gene for red hair is recessive to the gene for black hair. What will be the hair colour of a child if he inherits a gene for red colour from his mother and a gene for black hair from his father ? Express with the help of flow chart.,"(a) Speciation may take place by : (i) Migration (ii) Natural selection (iii) Mutation (iv) Genetic Drift (b) Segment of DNA which is functional and are made of nucleic acids and protein. (Any other definition) (c) Given, Red hair-Mother-Recessive \ bb Black hair-Father-Dominant \ BB Parents F1 Father BB/Bb Bb (Black) Mother Bb/bb Thus, the child will have black hair."
What are fossils ? How are they formed ? List two methods of determining the age of fossils. Explain in brief the importance of fossils in deciding the evolutionary relationships.  Explain the importance of fossils in deciding evolutionary relationships. ,"(i) Fossils : The remains/impression of dead / decayed plants / animals. (ii) Formation of fossils : Formed when dead organisms are compressed under high pressure deep under the soil. (iii) Determination of age of fossil—Two methods : 		(i) Relative method, 		(ii) Carbon dating method. (iv) The presence of fossilized remains of the organisms is the evidence of existence of the organisms millions of years ago, out of which some have become extinct. (v) Fossil also helps in the determination of the connecting links between various groups and their origin from the primitive ones."
What evidence do we have for the origin of life from inanimate matter ? ,"J.B.S. Haldane suggested that life must have developed from the simple inorganic molecules which were present on earth soon after it was formed. He speculated that the conditions on earth at that time could have given rise to more complex organic molecules that were necessary for life. The first primitive organisms would arise from further chemical synthesis. Later, Stanley L. Miller and Harold C. Urey conducted experiment to find out about the origin of organic molecules. They assembled an atmosphere similar to that thought to exist on early earth (molecules like ammonia, methane and hydrogen sulphide, but no oxygen over water). This was maintained at a temperature just below 100ºC and sparks were passed through the mixture of gases to stimulate lightning. At the end of a week, 15% of the carbon had been converted to simple compounds of carbon including amino acids which make up protein molecules. 1"
"A particular species ‘X’ has more common characteristics with species ‘Y’, whereas another species ‘Z’ has less common characteristics with species ‘Y’. Which two species are more closely related ? Why ? On what basis are the eukaryotic organisms further classified ? Why is this basis important ? What is the importance of homologous organs ?","Species ‘X’ is more closely related with species ‘Y’. 1 The more closely related species will have more characteristics in common. Hence species X and Y are closely related. Eukaryotic organisms are further classified on the basis of whether they are unicellular or multicellular. This basis marks a very fundamental difference in body design, because of specialisation of cell types and tissues. Homologous organs help to identify an evolutionary relationship between apparently different species. This is how life originated from inanimate matter."
