What are analogous organs ? Why cannot the wing of a butterfly and the wing of a bat be considered homologous organs ? State one reason. ,"Analogous organs : Organs with dissimilar basic structure or origin, but performing same function. 1 Because though they perform similar function, they have different origin/basic structure."
What is speciation ? State any two factors which could lead to speciation.,"Speciation : Origin of a new species from preexisting one. Factors : Mutation, Genetic drift, Geographical isolation, Reproduction isolation. (Any two) ½×2"
Write full forms of DNA. Where is it located ? ,Deoxyribonucleic Acid. It is located in the cell nucleus.  1+1
"What do the following terms mean ? (i) Micro-evolution, (ii) Fossils.","(i) Micro-evolution : Evolution resulting from small specific genetic changes that can lead to a new subspecies. (ii) Fossils : Fossils are preserved traces of living organisms, that got buried deep inside the earth million of years ago."
Name any four mechanisms which can lead to speciation in sexually reproducing organisms.,"Natural selection, genetic drift, variations and geographical isolation can lead to speciation in sexually reproducing organisms."
How does natural selection differ from genetic drift ?,"Natural selection selects those variations in a population which give a survival advantage and helps the better population to fit their environment better. On the other hand, genetic drift can alter gene frequencies in small populations and provide diversity without any survival benefits."
How are areas of study-evolution and classification interlinked ?  (),"The field of evolution and classification are interlinked in the following manner : (i) The more characteristics two species have in common, the more closely they are related. Classification of species is a reflection of their evolutionary relationship. (ii) The more number of characteristics shared by two organisms, more is the probability of their having common ancestors. Thus, classification of an organism is the reflection of its evolutionary path."
State two methods of determining the age of fossils. ,"(i) If we dig into the earth and start finding fossils, it can be assumed that the fossils closer to the surface are more recent to those found in the deeper layers. (ii) By detecting the ratios of different isotopes of the same element in the fossil material."
Can a wing of a butterfly and the wing of a bat be considered homologous organs ? Why or why not ?,No. A wing of a butterfly and wing of a bat can’t be considered homologous organs because wings of a bat are skin folds in between the fingers and wings of a butterfly are membrane supported by muscles. They are analogous organs.
"In an area A, the leaf material available to beetles was very less. What are the two consequences seen in the beetles ? ",The consequences are as follows : (i) They switched to new type of food and entered new niches. (ii) This lead to arise of diverse variety of beetles as some changes in beetles will take place to make them adaptable to new niches.
Will geographical isolation be a major factor in the speciation of an organism that reproduces asexually ? Why or why not ?,"No. Geographical isolation prevents gene flow between populations of a species whereas asexual reproduction generally involves only one individual. In an asexually reproducing organism, variations can occur only when the copying of DNA is not accurate. Therefore, geographical isolation cannot prevent the formation of new species in an asexually reproducing organism."
Give an example of characteristics being used to determine how close two species are in evolutionary terms.,"Analogous organs are one such evidence that is used to determine how close two species are related. The presence of feathers in dinosaurs and birds indicates that they are evolutionarily related. Dinosaurs had feathers not for flying but instead these feathers provided insulation to these warm- blooded animals. However, the feathers in birds are used for flight. This proves that reptiles and birds are closely related and that the evolution of wings started in reptiles."
Explain the importance of fossils in deciding evolutionary relationships. ,"Fossils are very important in tracing the path of evolution as by studying characters of fossils we are able to find their descendants and thus we can know what new variations have come. They provide evidence and missing links between the two classes. They are helpful in forming a sequence of organisms in the pathway of evolution. Thus, fossils have an importance in deciding evolutionary relationship."
What is speciation ? Explain in brief the role of natural selection and genetic drift in this process. ,"(i) Speciation : Origin of new species from pre− existing ones. Role of Genetic drift and natural selection : Genetic drift is flow of genes from one population to another by chance factor or randomly. Over generation it will accumulate different changes in different population. In addition, natural selection operates differently in different population selecting the fittest / favourable feature in both the population. Over a long period of time the differences in the two population may become so drastic that they no longer reproduce with each other and thus give rise to new species.1 "
What is speciation ? List four factors responsible for speciation. ,"Speciation is the evolution of reproductive isolation among once interbreeding population. Factors which can lead to speciation are— (i) Genetic drift–Over generation, genetic drift may accumulate which lead to speciation. (ii) Natural selection may work differently in different location which may give rise to speciation. (iii) Severe DNA change. (iv) A variation may occur which does not allow sexual act between two groups. "
Explain the following : (a) Speciation (b) Natural Selection ,"(a) Speciation : It is the evolution of reproductive isolation among once–interbreeding populations i.e., the development of one or more species from an existing species. () Factors which can lead to speciation are : (i) Genetic drift may accumulate which lead to speciation. (ii) Natural selection may work differently in different location which may give rise to speciation. (iii) Severe DNA change. (iv) A variation may occur which does not allow sexual act between two group. (b) Natural Selection : (i) There is natural variation within any population and same individuals have more favourable variations than others. (ii) Population remains fairly constant even though all species produce a large number of offsprings. (iii) This is due to ‘competition‘ or struggle for existence between same and different species. (iv) The struggle for survival within population eliminates the unfit individuals and those with ‘favourable variations‘ survive and pass on these variations to their progeny to continue. This is called natural selection. The favourable variations are accumulated over a long time period leading to the origin of a new species. "
“Natural Selection and Speciation leads to evolution.“ Justify this statement. ,"l Natural selection is defined as the change in frequency of some genes in a population, which gives survival advantage to a species. l Whereas speciation is the development of a new species from pre-existing ones. l This leads to a sequence of gradual change in the primitive organisms over millions of years, to form newer species which are very different from older ones. This is called evolution.  Detailed Answer : Natural selection is the phenomenon by which the nature selects those species which possess survival advantage over the other species. According to theory of natural selection, there is struggle of existence within the species of a population for the environmental resources and their struggle leads to survival of certain organisms and elimination of the less competent species. The better adapted organisms would, thus, survive and pass on their traits to next generation, gradually leading to evolution. Speciation is a process of formation of new species from the existing one due to reproductive isolation of a part of its population. This reproductive isolation can occur due to geographical isolation of a part of population. With time, the genetic drift will accumulate different variations in each of the geographically separated sub-population. Ultimately all the individuals of these two groups will isolate reproductively, thus, leading to formation and evolution of new species. Thus we can say that both natural selection and speciation lead to the evolution of species on earth."
"Explain with an example for each, how the following provides evidences in favour of evolution in organisms : (i) Homologous organs (ii) Analogous organs  (iii) Fossils. ","(i) Homologous organs : Forelimb of human and bird are homologous organs. They have same structural design and developmental origin but they have different functions and appearance. Homologous organs help us to understand that the organism have evolved from a common ancestor. The more common characteristics the two species have the more closely they are related. (ii) Analogous organs : Analogous organs are those organs which have different basic structural design and development origin but have similar appearance and perform similar functions. Example : The wings of birds and bats look similar but have different design in their structure. They have a common function of flying but their origins are not common. So, birds and bats are not closely related. (iii) Fossils and their study is useful in knowing about the species which are no longer alive. They provide evidence and missing links between two classes. They are helpful in forming a sequence of organisms in the pathway of evolution. Thus, fossils have an importance in deciding evolutionary relationship. Archaeopteryx is a fossil bird. It had feathers, fused bones and beak which are exclusively bird structures. It also had some features which are found in reptiles e.g., teeth in jaw, claws on free fingers and a long tail. This fossil provides a clue that birds have evolved from reptiles.  1+1+1"
List three main factors responsible for the speciation and briefly describe each of them. ,"Factors responsible for speciation : (i) Gene flow must be stopped so that sub-populations become genetically isolated. (ii) Mutation plays a role in speciation. Changes in allele and genotype frequencies within the populations, by natural selection. (iii) Genetic isolation leads to the formation of new species. (iv) Geographical barriers such as mountain ranges, seas or rivers may produce a barrier to gene flow and the inability of organisms or their gametes to meet, leads to reproductive isolation and hence speciation. Sometimes crossing of two unrelated species (Genetic Engineering) can also lead to speciation. (Any three) 1+1+1"
Define the following with one example for each : (i) Genetic Drift. (ii) Natural selection. (iii) Reproductive isolation. ,"(i) Genetic drift : It refers to the random change in gene frequencies in a small population, presumably owing to change rather than natural selection, thereby providing diversity without any adaptations. (ii) Natural selection : In this new suitable traits are selected to live in the prevailing environment. (iii) Reproductive isolation : When same members of a particular species are not able to mate with other members of the same species due to environmental barriers or due to other geographical barriers , it is known as reproductive isolation. between homologous and"
"Differentiate analogous organs. Give one example of each.   [Board Term II, Set (2007), 2012]",Organs which have similar structure but different functions are known as homologous organs. e.g. forelimbs of a lizard and forelimb of a man. Organs which have similar functions but different structures are known as analogous organs. e.g. wing of a bat and wing of a bird.
"Define evolution. Why are traits acquired during life time of an individual not inherited ?   [Board Term II, Set (2008) 2012]","Formation of new species because of barriers, genetic drift and natural selection takes place which leads to complex structures with better survival advantage. This is known as evolution. The traits, which are acquired during the life time of an organism affect the structure and functioning of cells, tissues and organs without affecting the genetic material and thus are not inherited.  1½+1½"
“Evolution and Classification of organisms are interlinked.‘‘ Give reasons to justify this statement. ," Detailed Answer : Every organism has an in built tendency for genetic variation which plays an important role in the origin of new species and forms the basis for evolution. The more characteristics two species have in common, the more closely they are related. Classification of organisms involves organising them in different groups, based on the similarities and dissimilarities of characteristics. Therefore, classification of species is a reflection on their evolutionary relationship. Thus, we can say that evolution and classification of organisms are interlinked. 3"
What are fossils ? State their importance in the study of evolution with the help of a suitable example.  What are fossils ? What do they tell us about the process of evolution ? ,"Fossils are remains or impressions of past organisms that are found in the rocks. Fossils of lower strata belong to early periods while those of upper strata are of later periods. Arranging the fossils stratum wise will indicate the occurrence of different forms of life at different times. It is found that the early fossils generally belong to simple organisms. Complexity and elaboration increased gradually with evolution. (i) Fossils indicate the path of evolution of different groups. (ii) They can indicate the phylogeny of some organisms. e.g. horse, elephants. (iii) Some fossils have characteristics intermediate between two groups e.g. Toothed bird Archaeopteryx. They indicate how one group has evolved from another."
"(i) What are fossils ? How do we know how old the fossils are ? (ii) State two differences between homologous and analogous organs. [Board Term II, Set (2024), 2012]",(i) Fossils : The remains and / or impressions of organisms that lived in the past. (a) The fossils that we find close to the surface are more recent than the one we find in deeper layers. 		(b) Dating fossils by detecting the ratio of different isotopes of the same element. (ii)		(a) Homologous organs have same basic structural design. 			(b) Analogous organs have different basic structural design. 			(c) Homologous organs perform different functions. 			(d) Analogous organs perform similar functions.  ½
(i) Which of the following fossils is invertebrate and which one is vertebrate ?,"(i) (a) vertebrate, (b) invertebrate. (ii) If we dig into a rock / earth then it is reasonable to suppose that the fossil found in the upper layers must be of more recent origin than the fossil found in the deeper layers. The second way is by detecting the ratios of different isotopes of the same element in the fossil material. 1 "
"Name three organisms which are fossilized.  (a) Dinosaur, (b) Ammonite. (ii) How can the age of fossil be ascertained ? State in brief any two methods. [Board Term II, Set (2036), 2012]","(i) Dinosaur, (ii) Ammonite, (iii) Trilobite. 1 × 3 = 3 "
Give two uses of fossils. How does the study of fossils provide evidence in favour of organic evolution ?,The two uses of fossils are : (i) Racial history of plants. (ii) Past climatic conditions of earth. Study of fossils provide evidence in favour of organic evolution because : (i) Fossils helps to identify an evolutionary relationship between apparently different species. (ii) The fossils present in the bottom rocks are simple while the most recent fossil found in the upper strata are highly complex. This geographical succession completely agrees with the concept of evolution.
"When organisms die, their bodies will decompose and be lost. Then how do we get fossils ? Give an example.","In most cases when organisms die, their bodies decompose and become lost. But every once in a while, the body or at least some parts of the body may be in an environment that does not decompose completely. It is through such preserved traces of living organisms that we get fossils. For example : If a dead insect gets caught in hot mud, it will not decompose quickly, the mud will eventually harden and retain the impression of the body parts of the insect."
How are fossil formed ? State any one role of fossils in the study of organic evolution ? ,"Formation : On certain occassions, a dead body or at least some parts may be in an environment that does not let it decompose completely and gets preserved, subsequently either the part or its impression becomes a fossil. Role of Fossil : Provides missing link between the species/who has evolved from whom. They tell us about prehistoric organisms. "
Mention three important features of fossils which help in the study of evolution. ,Three important features of fossils which help in the study of evolution are : (i) Fossils represent modes of preservation of ancient species. (ii) Fossils help in establishing evolutionary traits among organisms and their ancestors. (iii) Their physical structure helps us provide a link between two different species of Organisms.
‘’Two areas of study namely ‘evolution’ and ‘classification’ are interlinked’’. Justify this statement.  ,"(i) Different forms of organisms/ life have evolved during the course of evolution, and classification deals with grouping of these organisms into groups and subgroups based on their similarities and differences. (ii) The more characteristics any two species have in common more closely they are related/ will have a more recent ancestor (and vice versa). (iii) Thus classification helps tracing the evolutionary relationships between the two organisms. Hence classification and evolution are interlinked.  1 "
Give an example of the characteristics being used to determine how close two species are in evolutionary terms. ,"Study of homologous organs as forelimbs of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibian; show that though they perform different functions have similar basic / internal structure; this is because they have evolved from common ancestor and help us in determining the closeness between two species in evolutionary terms  1 + 1 + 1"
“Evolution should not be equated with progress”. Why ? ,"Evolution is simply the generation of diversity and the shaping of the diversity by environmental selection. Species adapt to the conditions available in their environment. Some older and simple species live on quite effectively. The only progressive trend in evolution seems to be that more and more complex body designs have emerged over time. In fact, one of the simplest life forms like bacteria – inhabit the most inhospitable habitats like hot springs, deep-sea thermal vents and the ice in Antarctica."
Homologous organs are different from analogous organs. (i) Mention the two basic characteristics that decide about analogy and homology between the two organs. (ii) On what basis is the classification of organisms into prokaryotic and eukaryotic done ? ,"(i) The two basic characteristics that decide about analogy and homology are origin, structures and function. (ii) In prokaryotic organism no true nucleus is found. Therefore, nucleus is absent. In eukaryotic organisms true nucleus is found.  1 + 1 + 1"

List three factors that provide evidences in favour of evolution in organisms and state the role of each in brief.  ,Three factors / evidences and their roles. (i) Analogous organs : Organisms with similar looking organs may have different origin. (ii) Homologous organs : Organisms with apparently different looking organs may have similar origin. (iii) Fossils : Allow us to make estimates of how far back evolutionary relationships go. Fossils when chronologically arranged help in tracing the evolutionary history of an organism.

"(a) Cite the evidence on the basis of which it is concluded that birds have evolved from reptiles. (b) Insects, Octopus, Planaria and Vertebrates also possess eyes. Can these animals be grouped together on the basis of the eyes they possess. Why or why not ? Give reason to justify your answer.  ","(a) (i) Fossils showing imprints of feathers along with the bones in dinosaurs/reptiles found. 		(ii) They could not fly and presumably use the feathers for insulation. 		(iii) Later they developed/evolved and adapted feathers for flight. 		(iv) Thus, they give evidence that birds have evolved from reptiles. (b) No, the structure of the eye in each of these organisms is different/they have separate evolutionary origins. "
‘Variations that confer an advantage to an individual organism only will survive in a population.’ Justify.  Only variation that confer an advantage to an individual organism will survive in a population. Do you agree with this statement ? Why or why not ? ,"Useful variations give advantage to individuals in obtaining more food, reproduction, adaptation to environmental changes and higher success in the struggle for existence. They give benefit in survival and increasing the population. Differential reproduction increases the useful variations in the populations. Other individuals with harmful variations will be destroyed. For example, some bacteria have ability to tolerate high temperature. But other non-resistant bacteria will be killed. 3 "
"(i) Planaria, insects, octopus and vertebrates all have eyes. Can we group eyes of these animals together to establish a common evolutionary origin ? Justify your answer. (ii) “Birds have evolved from reptiles“. State evidence to prove the statement. ","(i) Yes, eyes can be grouped together, which have evolved over generation from imperfect eyes in Planaria to perfect eyes in vertebrates. (A) (B) (ii) Dinosaur is a type of reptile which has wings. Birds also have wings, so it can be proved that birds have evolved from reptiles. "
"The modern human beings have originated in Africa. (i) Which evidence suggests this fact ? (ii) If an animal is similar to its ancestors, what does this imply ? ","(i) This was shown by the help of fossil records of Homo erectus, according to which their cranial capacity had doubled. Homo erectus were the first to leave Africa and spread through Africa, Asia, and Europe. One population of H. erectus, stayed in Africa and evolved into Homo sapiens. (ii) This implies that from the beginning of life on earth the inheritance of trait is going on, that result in the production of existing animals that look similar to their ancestors because they have inherited traits from them and these trait that make them similar to their ancestors have not gone under evolutionary change. "
Why are small number of surviving tigers a cause of worry from the point of view of genetics ? Explain. ,"(i) If any natural calamity occurs and kills these small number of surviving tigers, they can become extinct resulting in the loss of genes forever. (ii) Small number will lead to little recombination and lesser variations that are very important for giving better survival chances to the species. (iii) Less number of species means lesser extent of diversity and lesser number of traits which reduce the chances of adaptability with respect to the change in the environment."
Does the occurrence of diversity of animals on earth suggest their diverse ancestry also ? Discuss this point in the light of evolution. ,"Though animals have a vast diversity in structures they probably do not have a common ancestry because common ancestry may greatly limit the extent of diversity. As many of these diverse animals are inhabiting the same habitat, their evolution by geographical isolation and speciation is also not likely."
"(i) A husband has 46 chromosomes, his wife has 46 chromosomes. Then why don’t their offsprings have 46 pairs of chromosomes, which is obtained by the fusion of male and female gametes ? (ii) “Geographical isolation is not a major factor in the speciation of a self pollinating plant species.” Justify this statement with the help of an example.","(i) Male individual has 46 chromosomes but because the gametes are always haploid i.e., they have half the no. of chromosomes; sperms will be haploid (23 chromosomes). Female individual also contains only 23 chromosomes in egg. It is the fusion of this sperm and egg which leads to an offspring with 46 chromosomes. (ii) Geographical isolation will not be a major factor in the speciation of a self-pollinating plant species. It involves the same flower / plant from where male and female gametes are formed."
"How were farmers able to obtain present day cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli from wild cabbage ?","Farmers were able to grow present day cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli from wild cabbage by [Board Term II, Set (67003) 2012] selective breeding. Broccoli was selected by breeding larger flower stalks and cabbage was bred by selecting shorter petioles. Cauliflower is also a descendent of wild cabbage. It was bred by selecting sterile flowers."
