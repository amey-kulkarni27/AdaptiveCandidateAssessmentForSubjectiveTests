0,Q. 1. What is the main difference between sperms and eggs of humans ? Write the importance of this difference. ,"Ans. Difference between sperms and eggs of humans : The major genetic differences lies in the difference in sex chromosome of sperm (male gamete) and egg ( female gamete).

28,Q. 18. Write one difference between sexual and asexual mode of reproduction. Which species is likely to have better chances of survival – the one reproducing asexually or the one reproducing sexually ? Justify your answer. ,"Ans. Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of the male and the female gamete. This fusion allows the formation of new variants by the combination of the DNA from two (usually) different members of the species. The variations allow the individuals to adapt under varied environmental conditions for better chances of survival. However, it is not always necessary that the offspring produced due to sexual reproduction has better chances of survival. Under some circumstances, asexual reproduction is more advantageous for certain organisms. For example, some individuals who do not move from one place to another and are well settled in their environment. Also, asexual reproduction is a fast and a quick mode of reproduction which does not consume much time and energy as compared to sexual reproduction. 2"
