A student confirms binary fission process in a unicellular organism after observing a slide under microscope. What he might have observed in that slide to reach to this condition ? ,(i) An organism having elongated and constricted nucleus. (ii) An organism having two nuclei with constriction in between.  1 + 1
Are binary fission and budding faster processes of reproduction when compared to sexual reproduction. Justify.,"Yes. Binary fission and budding do not involve any variations, also these involve single parent. 1 + 1"

"You have to perform the experiment, “To identify the different parts of an embryo of a gram seed”. Describe the procedure that you would follow. ",(i) Soak a few seeds of gram/Bengal gram/chana/ kidney beans/ etc and leave them overnight. (ii) Drain the excess water. (iii) Cover the seeds with a wet cloth and leave them for a day. (iv) Cut open the seed carefully and observe the different parts.
Write the procedure for seed germination.,(i) Take a petri dish. Place damp cotton on it. (ii) Put the dicot seeds on the petri dish. Allow it to germinate. (iii) Place the germinated seed on the watch glass. (iv) Open the two cotyledons with a forceps and needle. (v) Observe the structure of seed. (iv) Also observe the embryonal axis with a magnifying glass and label its parts.
Distinguish between albuminous seed and exalbuminous seed.,"Albuminous seed : Seeds having copious amount of endosperm. e.g., Wheat Ex-albuminous seed : Seeds in which endosperm is used up. e.g., Grass"
Write two precautions to be taken while identifying different parts of an embryo of a dicot seed.,"(i) Conditions for the seed germination should be optimum i.e. warmth, moisture and air. (ii) Care should be taken to separate two cotyledons so that the embryonal axis is intact."
The students of a class were asked by the teacher to study the different parts of an embryo of an angiosperm. Write down the correct steps for the experiment ?,"First of all, take some dry gram seeds in a Petri dish. Now, soak the seeds in plain water and keep them overnight. Drain the excess water. After that, cover the soaked seeds with a wet cotton cloth and leave them for a day. Finally, cut open a soaked seed and observe its different parts."
"Write down the name of materials required in the experiment, germination of seeds?","For showing germination, seeds of gram, water, bowl and wet clothes are required."
A student was asked to observe and identify the various parts of an embryo of a red kidney bean seed. He identified the parts and listed them as under: (i) Tegmen HOW DO ORGANISMS REPRODUCE ? (ii) Testa (iii) Cotyledon (iv) Radicle (v) Plumule Write down the correctly identified parts among these?,"Testa, Radical and Plumule are various parts of an embryo of a red kidney bean."
A student has to perform the experiment “To identify the different parts of an embryo of a dicot seed.” Name three dicot seeds? Seeds on germination give rise to ______ and _________.,"Three dicot seeds are: Red kidney bean, Pea and gram. Seeds on germination give rise to radicle and plumule"
(a) Name the structure which stores food in the seeds? (b) What is the importance of seed coat in a dicotyledonous seed?,(a) Cotyledons store food. (b) Seed coat is for protection
