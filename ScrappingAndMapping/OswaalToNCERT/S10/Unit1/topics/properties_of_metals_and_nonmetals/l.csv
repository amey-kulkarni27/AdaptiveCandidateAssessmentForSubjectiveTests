(ii) Name a non-metal which is a good conductor of heat and electricity. (iii) As a student, what initiative you will take to comment on the statement that ‘‘Iodised salt is good for health.’’ Give any two suggestions.","Ans. (i) Deficiency of iodine leads to goitre. It also leads and have metallic lustre. Non-metals are usually to hypothyroidism, a most common disease among soft, do not possess lustre and are not malleable ladies above 40 years of age. and ductile. But iodine is a non-metal which has (ii) Graphite is a non-metal which is a good conductor metallic lustre. Iodine is also important for us of heat and electricity. also. Non-metals are bad conductors of heat and (iii) Suggestions : electricity. 		(a) To start an awareness campaign in localities, homes and schools.

1,"Q. 2. Compose an activity to arrange Ca, Mg and Fe metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with water. Write suitable balanced chemical equation and draw diagrams. ","Ans. Take some metals like Ca, Mg and Fe etc. Place separately small pieces of these metals in beakers with small amount of water in them. If the metals react with the cold water, then the reaction is vigorous. If metal does not react with cold water, then treat it with hot water. Record the observations and arrange the metals in decreasing order of reactivity. Metal Reaction Fe Steam Observation Mg Hot water Mg(OH)2(aq) & H2(g) Chemical reaction 3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + H2(g) Mg(s) + 2H2O(hot) → Mg(OH)2(aq) + H2(g) Ca Cold water Ca(OH)2(aq) & H2(g) Ca(s) + 2H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g) Fe3O4 and H2(g) Metal sample Hydrogen Glass-wool soaked in water Burner Cork Stand Water Delivery tube METALS AND NON-METALS"
2,"Q. 3. How is the method of extraction of metals high up in the reactivity series different from that for metals in the middle ? Why the same process cannot be applied for them ? Explain giving equations, the extraction of sodium. [Board Term-I Set (31) 2012]",Ans. Metals high up in reactivity series are extracted by electrolytic reduction. While those in the middle are extracted first by converting into oxide and then reducing by carbon. Same method cannot be used because metals have more affinity for oxygen than carbon. Molten sodium chloride is taken for electrolytic reduction. The metals are deposited at the cathode and chlorine is liberated at anode. At cathode : Na+ + e– → Na At anode : 2Cl– → Cl2 + 2e–
3,"Q. 4. A man went door to door posing to be a goldsmith. He promised to bring back the glitter of old and dull gold ornaments. An unsuspecting lady gave a set of gold bangles to him which he dipped in a particular solution. The bangles sparkled like new but their weight was reduced drastically. The lady was upset but after a futile argument, the man beat a hasty retreat. (i) Can you play the detective to find out the nature of the solution he had used ? (ii) What is 24 carat gold ?",Ans. (i) The nature of the solution is acidic. It is a mixture of conc. HNO3 and conc. HCl in the ratio of 1 : 3. It can dissolve gold as it is an oxidising agent. (ii) Pure gold is 24 carat gold which is very soft.
