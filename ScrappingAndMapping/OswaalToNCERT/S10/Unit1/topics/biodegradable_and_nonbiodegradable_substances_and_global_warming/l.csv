What are chlorofluorocarbon ? How are they responsible for causing ozone hole in atmosphere? What will be the consequences of ozone hole ?,"Carbon compounds which contain chlorine and fluorine are called CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons). e.g., CCl2 F2 (Dichlorodifluoromethane). They lead to depletion of ozone layer causing ozone hole. (Nitric oxide also reacts with ozone to form NO2 and O2. CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) react with ozone in stratosphere and depletes ozone. (i) It may lead to skin burns. (ii) It may cause skin cancer."
"A non-biodegradable toxic chemical has entered into the food chain. Which type of food habit will you suggest to a man, vegetarian or non-vegetarian. Explain with the help of a food chain. The food chain which you would suggest, is advantageous in an another aspect. How ?","Vegetarian food chain will be suggested in case of entry of non-biodegradable toxic chemical into the () food chain. Non-biodegradable chemical gets concentrated at every trophic level by the process of biological concentration. As the concentration increases with the number of trophic level in a food chain, man will get high concentration of the chemical in non– vegetarian food chain than in a vegetarian food chain. Example : Vegetarian food chain : 		Plants → Man 		5 PPM 240 PPM 		of DDT of DDT Non-vegetarian food chain : 			Plants → Goat → Man 		5 PPM 240 PPM 1600 PPM 		of DDT		 of DDT of DDT 		Vegetarian food chain is advantageous in terms of energy available to man because it has less number of trophic level. As 90% of energy is lost to the environment, at every level lesser number of trophic level will result in lesser energy loss. 3 +2"
