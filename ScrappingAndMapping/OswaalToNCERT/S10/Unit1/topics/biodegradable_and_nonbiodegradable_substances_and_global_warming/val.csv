"The activities of man had adverse effects on all forms of living organisms in the biosphere. Unlimited exploitation of nature by man has disturbed the delicate ecological balance between the living and non-living components of the biosphere. The unfavourable conditions created by man himself threatened the survival not only of himself but also of the entire living organisms on the mother earth.

(a) Why is it necessary to conserve our environment ? (b) State the importance of green and blue dust-bins in the safe disposal of the household waste. (c) List two values exhibited by your classmate who is an active member of Eco-club of your school. ","Two reasons for the conservation of the environment : (a) (i) To save air, water and soil from pollution. (ii) To maintain ecological balance in nature. (b) Green dustbins for biodegradable waste, and blue dustbins for non-biodegradable waste are meant for proper disposal of waste without wasting time and energy in segregating the biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes. (c) Values : cooperative spirit, concern about environment, civic sense or any other. (Any two) 2 × ½ = 1  "
Your school was awarded best eco-friendly school award due to the efforts of eco club of your school. (a) List any two activities that helped eco club to win this award.

(Any two) (b) (i) The members appreciate the fact that rational use of natural resources is their responsibilities towards saving the nature for future generations as well.

"Your uncle has come from the village to renew the contract to supply frogs to the laboratories of the colleges of the town. While talking to you, he mentioned that cases of malaria has increased in the village this year. In addition, population of grasshoppers has also increased who are damaging the crop. (i) What can be the reasons for the problem faced by the villagers ? (ii) What do you learn from the incident ? (iii) What suggestions will you give to your uncle ? 1","(i) Due to large scale removal of frogs, the population of frogs got reduced in the village. Due to absence of frog in food chain, grasshopper / mosquitoes – frog – snake, the population of grasshoppers and mosquitoes have gone up. Mosquitoes are the carriers of malaria vector and grasshoppers damage the crop. (ii) Every organism has a very important role in nature and we should not disturb this food chain artificially. If one link is removed from the food chain, the whole chain gets disturbed and new problems arises. (iii) I will request him not to renew his contract for supply of frogs with the colleges. This will increase the frog population and population of mosquitoes and grasshoppers will decrease and a balance will be attained soon."
"Food chain is a sequence of organisms through which energy is transferred in the form of food by the process of one organism consuming the other. It shows the relationship of producer and consumer, i.e., ‘who eats whom’. Thus it is a series of organisms taking part at various biotic levels from the producer and ends in consumer. (i) Why are green plants known as producers ? (ii) ‘Man is only a consumer’. Justify the statement by giving any two reasons. (b) How can we contribute in maintaining the parks and roads neat and clean ?","(a) Burning of plastic is a curse to environment because it pollutes the environment by liberating toxic and poisonous gases. Rakesh suggested to separate biodegradable and non-biodegradable recyclable and non-recyclable wastes so that compost can be prepared from kitchen wastes or fruits peels and there should be a safe disposal of plastics. This makes our environment clean. (ii) Consumers are the organisms which depend on others for their survival, or food. Consumers are herbivores, carnivores or omnivores. Man is omnivore which depend on others for its food either plants or flesh."
"Biomagnification is the progressive increase in concentration of harmful non-biodegradable chemical per unit weight of the organisms with the successive rise in different trophic levels in a food chain. Harmful non-biodegradable chemicals include pesticide such as DDT and heavy metals such as mercury, arsenic, nickel, cadmium etc. The harmful chemicals get biomagnified in a food chain and affect the human beings and other biotic components of the environment. In a food chain : Water → Plankton → Fish → Fish eating bird, if DDT enters, its concentration shall increase from plankton to fish. (i) Name the trophic level where biomagnification is maximum. (ii) “Biomagnification, the cause, effects and prevention”. Give any three talk mentioned by environmentalist on the topic.","(i) Biomagnification is maximum in fourth trophic level i.e., fish. (ii) (a) Caused by the use of several pesticides and chemicals for crop protection and storage. (b) It harms the trophic level and causes toxicity and death. (c) It can be prevented by minimising the use of chemicals in food productivity."
"Ayush went to Puri in Orissa on a holiday recently. There are lots of tourists in the beach and the beach was very dirty with plastic, paper, waste food, mineral water bottle, etc. Ayush decided to do something to save the beach. (a) What can Ayush do to save the beach from becoming a dumping ground ? (b) How can government help in keeping the beach clean ?",(a) Ayush can make few banners requesting tourists to keep the beach clean and put it in different locations at the beach. He can also mobilise a few volunteers from local people to start a cleanliness drive on the beach. The volunteers should be motivated to do the cleanliness drive once or twice every month. (b) The government can enforce law to prevent people from throwing items on the beach. Designated place should be kept for eating at the beach. Garbage bins should be placed at proper distances for easy waste disposal.
"The ozone layer is a layer of the earth’s atmosphere in which most of the atmosphere’s ozone is concentrated. It protects the earth from harmful radiation like high energy U-V radiations from passing through it. Protective role of the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere is so vital that scientists believe life on earth probably would not have evolved and could not exist today without it. In 1970’s, scientist discovered that chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) can reach the stratosphere and destroy the ozone gas. In 1985, scientist discovered that every year, the ozone layer over Antarctica becomes drastically thinner during southern hemisphere spring, which forms a ‘Ozone hole’ over Antarctica. (i) Name any four appliances which chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere. release (ii) ‘Damage to the ozone layer is a cause for concern.’ Justify this statement. Suggest any three steps to limit this damage.","(i) Four appliances which releases Chlorofluorocarbon are : (a) Aerosol spray (b) Air conditioner (c) Refrigerator (d) Coolant (ii) Exposure to U-V rays can lead to greater incidence of skin cancer, cataracts or other damages to the eye and immune deficiency. Three steps to limit this damage are : (a) Stop the release of Chlorofluorocarbon (b) Removing the pollutant nitrogen monoxide (c) Reduce the usage of air conditioners"
