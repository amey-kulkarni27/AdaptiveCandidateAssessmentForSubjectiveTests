0,Q. 1. You want to study a decomposition reaction by taking ferrous sulphate crystals in a boiling tube. List two precautions you would follow while doing the experiment. ,Ans.  Take a dry boiling tube.  Keep mouth of test-tube away from yourself. 1 + 1 
1,"Q. 2. While studying a type of reactions, Neena mixed the substances as shown below :",Ans.  Copper is displaced by iron.  It is a displacement reaction. 
2,Q. 4. Observe the following figures A and B. Iron nail Copper sulphate solution Ferrous sulphate crystals State the change in substances taken is test-tubes A and B. Mention the type of reaction in each case.   Has Neena observed the occurrence of reaction ? If not why ?  What kind of reaction she wanted to study ? ,"Ans.  No, the substances should be taken in solution form.  Double displacement reaction. "
3,"Q. 3. On keeping iron nails in blue coloured copper sulphate solution, it is observed that the colour of the solution turns light green after some time. Give reason for this colour change. Name the type of this reaction. ","Ans. In A, green colour of solution fades away and brown red deposition on iron nail occursdisplacement reaction. In B, a reddish brown substance is left in the testtube-decomposition reaction. "
4,"Q. 5. While performing an experiment a student observes that when he heats some green crystals in a boiling tube, the colour of the crystals changes to brown and a gas evolves which smells like burning sulphur. Interpret the observations and results. ","Ans. Observation : The green colour of ferrous sulphate crystals changes to brownish black ferric oxide and smell of burning sulphur is observed. Result : Heating of ferrous sulphate is a thermal decomposition reaction because ferrous sulphate breaks down into simpler compounds—Fe2O3, SO2 and SO3. Heat → Fe2O3 + SO2 + SO3 2FeSO4 "
5,Q. 6. Fill up the gaps left in the following table : Experiment Observation Inference in the type of reaction  Quick lime + water  Ferrous sulphate + Heat crystals,"Ans.  Evolution of steamy vapours/container becomes warm, combination reaction.  Evolution of gases /smell like burning sulphur/brown residue left in container, Decomposition reaction."
6,Q. 7. What is the theory behind the precipitation reaction between aqueous solution of barium chloride with aqueous solution of sodium sulphate ?,"Ans. When a solution of sodium sulphate is mixed with a solution of barium chloride, the following double displacement reaction takes place : → BaSO4 + 2NaCl Na2SO4 + BaCl2  In this reaction, sulphate ions from sodium sulphate are displaced by chloride ions  and chloride ions in barium chloride are displaced by sulphate ions. As a result, a white precipitate of barium sulphate is formed and sodium chloride remains in the solution."
7,Q. 8. What happens when barium chloride solution and sodium sulphate solution are mixed together? Write the chemical equation.,"Ans. An insoluble salt is formed, which is barium sulphate and white in colour. BaCl2 + Na2SO4 → BaSO4 + 2NaCl "
8,"Q. 9. Solutions of ferrous sulphate, zinc sulphate, copper sulphate and aluminium sulphate were separately taken in four test-tubes and some iron nails were placed in each of the solutions. What will you observe after few seconds?",Ans. Iron will react only with CuSO4 solution as Fe is more reactive than Cu.
9,Q. 10. A student added aluminium pieces in ferrous sulphate solution taken in a test-tube. Write down the colour change she observed in the solution?,Ans. Solution becomes pale green to colourless.
10,Q. 11. Sarthak took two test-tubes A and B containing pale green and blue solutions respectively. Write down the name of the respective solutions taken in test tube A and B?,Ans. Solution taken in A is FeSO4 and B is CuSO4.
