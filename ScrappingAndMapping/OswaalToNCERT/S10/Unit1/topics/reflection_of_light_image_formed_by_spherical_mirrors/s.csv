(ii) Size of image is equal to that of the object. (iii) Image is formed at the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror. (iv) Image is laterally inverted.
An object is placed at a distance of 30 cm in front of a convex mirror of focal length 15 cm. Write four characteristics of the image formed by the mirror. ,Image is— (i) Virtual (ii) Erect (iii) Diminished (iv) Laterally invented  Detailed Answer : Four properties of image formed by the given convex mirror are : (i) Image is always erect. (ii) Small in size (iii) Virtual (iv) Always form behind the mirror between focus and pole
An object is placed at a distance of 40 cm in front of a convex mirror of radius of curvature 40 cm. List four characteristics of the image formed by the mirror.  (),Image is— (i) Virtual (ii) Erect (iii) Diminished (iv) Laterally invented
An object is placed at a distance of 12 cm in front of a concave mirror of radius of curvature 30 cm. List four characteristics of the image formed by the mirror. ,Four properties of the image formed by the given concave mirror of the object placed between focus and pole of the mirror are : (i) Image is always erect. (ii) Big in size (iii) Virtual (iv) Always forms behind the mirror.
List two properties of the images formed by convex mirrors. Draw ray diagram in support of your answer. ,(i) It forms virtual and erect image. (ii) It forms image smaller than the object. (Any two) 2 × ½ = 1 i r A' B' F  1 LIGHT–REFLECTION AND REFRACTION
"You are given a concave mirror, plane mirror and a convex mirror. How can you distinguish between them by just looking your face in them. State the common nature of the image that you see in all of them. ",(i) Image is of same size in plane mirror. (ii) Image is enlarged in concave mirror. (iii) Image is diminished in convex mirror. (iv) Image in all the three is virtual.
List four specific characteristics of the images of the objects formed by convex mirrors. ,"Four specific characteristics of the image formed by convex mirror : (i) It is always formed behind the mirror, between the pole and its focus. (ii) The image is always virtual and erect. (iii) The size of image is always smaller than the object. (iv) Magnification is always positive. "
State two laws of reflection of light. ,"(i) The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane. (ii) The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection."
A ray of light travelling in air enters obliquely into water. Does the light ray bend towards the normal or away from the normal ? Why ?,"The light ray bends towards the normal when a ray of light travels from an optically rarer medium to an optically denser medium. Since water is optically denser than air, a ray of light travelling from air into water will bend towards the normal."
"State two positions in which a concave mirror produces a magnified image of a given object. List two differences between the two images.  List two possible ways in which a concave mirror can produce a magnified image of an object placed in front of it. State the difference, if any, between these two images. ",(i) When the object is placed in front of the mirror : (a) between its pole and focus (b) between the focus and centre of curvature ½ (ii) In case (a) the image is virtual and erect. In case (b) the image is real and inverted. 
"Differentiate a real image from a virtual image giving two points of difference. [Board Term II, Set (2021), 2012]",S. No. Real Image Virtual Image (i) Formed when reflected Formed at a point from rays meet. which the reflected rays appear to diverge. (ii) Image is always It is always erect. inverted.  1+1
The linear magnification produced by a spherical mirror is +3. Analyse this value and state the (i) type of mirror and (ii) position of the object with respect to the pole of the mirror. Draw ray diagram to show the formation of image in this case. ,(i) Concave mirror (ii) Between the pole and focus. r A' B' 
"Under what condition in an arrangement of two plane mirrors, incident ray and reflected ray will always be parallel to each other, whatever may be angle of incidence. Show the same with the help of diagram. ",When two plane mirrors are placed at right angle to each other then incident and reflected rays will always be parallel to each other.
A student wants to project the image of a candle flame on a screen 60 cm in front of a mirror by keeping the flame at a distance of 15 cm from its pole. (i) Write the type of mirror he should use. (ii) Find the linear magnification of the image produced. (iii) What is the distance between the object and its image ? (iv) Draw a ray diagram to show the image formation in this case. ,"(i) He should use a concave mirror, as it forms a real image on the same side of the mirror. (ii) Object distance, u = – 15 cm Image distance, v = – 60 cm Magnification, m = – v /u  = – (– 60)/ (– 15)  = – 4 cm, The minus sign in magnification shows that the image formed is real and inverted. (iii) The image is formed at a distance of 45 cm from the object. In this case, the image is formed beyond the centre of curvature. This image is real, inverted and enlarged."
