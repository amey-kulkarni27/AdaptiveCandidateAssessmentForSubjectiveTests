If you are given blue litmus paper only, how will you identify the contents of each test tube ?","Ans. Put blue litmus paper in all the three test tubes. In one test tube it will turn red that is acid. Now Put red Litmus paper in other two test tubes. The one which turn blue is base and the third one is distilled water, as it turned paper neither red nor blue."
6,Q. 7. A compound ‘P’ forms the enamel of teeth. It is the hardest substance of the body. It doesn’t dissolve in water but gets corroded when the pH is lowered below 5.5. (i) Identify the compound ‘P’. (ii) How does it undergo damage due to eating of chocolate and sweets ? What should we do to prevent tooth decay ?  3,"Ans. (i) The compound ‘P’ is calcium phosphate. (ii) It undergoes damage when the bacteria present in the mouth work on the left over food particles and produce acid. To prevent tooth decay, toothpastes (basic) are used which neutralises the excess acid."
7,"Q. 8. (a) You are given two solutions A and B. The pH of solution A is 6 and pH of solution B is 8. (i) Identify the acidic and basic solution. 		(ii) Which solution has more H+ ion concentration ? Give reasons for your answer. (b) Why is HCl a stronger acid than acetic acid ? Explain. [Board Term-I Set (38), 2012] 3","Ans. (a) (i) Acidic — Solution A Basic — Solution B 		(ii) Solution A because H+ ion concentration is higher in acidic solutions. (b) When same concentration of HCl and acetic acid are taken (one molar), then these produce different amounts of H+ ion (as HCl dissociates completely). HCl gives more H+ but acetic acid gives less H+ ions (as this does not dissociate completely). "
8,"Q. 9. (a) Rahul has been stung by a honey bee and is in great pain. What could be the reason for this burning pain ? State the type of chemical compound that can be applied on the affected area to give relief to Rahul. (b) Write the name and formula of each of the following (i) an acidic salt 		(ii) a basic salt 		(iii) a neutral salt. [Board Term-I Set (49), 2012] 3","Ans. (a) (i) Bee-sting injects methanoic acid. (ii) A mild base like baking soda will give relief. 1 (b) (i) Ammonium chloride, NH4Cl (ii) Sodium carbonate, Na2CO3 (iii) Sodium chloride, NaCl. "
9,Q. 10. A substance X used as an antacid reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce a gas Y which is used in extinguishing fire. (i) Name the substance X and gas Y. (ii) Write a balanced equation of the reaction between X and hydrochloric acid.  3,Ans. (i) X – Sodium hydrogen carbonate or baking soda. Y – CO2 (ii) NaHCO3 + HCl → NaCl + H2O + CO2↑ 
10,"Q. 11. (a) A metal compound ‘X’ reacts with dil H2SO4 to produce effervescence. The gas evolved extinguishes a burning candle.

Tartaric acid is used to avoid the bitter taste by reacting with Na2CO3 formed. Heat → Na2CO3 + H2O + NaHCO3 + H+ From acid CO2  ½"
13,"Q. 14. (i) Dry pellets of a base ‘X’ when kept in open absorbs moisture and turns sticky. The compound is also formed by chlor-alkali process. Write chemical name and formula of X. Describe chloralkali process with balanced chemical equation. Name the type of reaction that occurs when X is treated with dilute hydrochloric acid. Write the chemical equation. (ii) While diluting an acid, why is it recommended that the acid should be added to water and not water to the acid ? [Board Term-I Set (36), 2012] 5","Ans. (i) X–NaOH (Sodium hydroxide) When electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium chloride, it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. 2NaCl + 2H2O 2NaOH + Cl2 + H2 Neutralisation reaction NaOH + HCl → NaCl + H2O (ii) Acid should be added slowly to water with constant stirring.
