0,Q. 1. (i) Define dispersion of light (ii) Name the colour that deviates least and the one which deviates most while passing through a glass prism.  (1 mark each) (2 marks each),Ans. (i) Dispersion : Breaking up of white light into component colours. (ii) Red colour deviates the least and violet deviates the most.  1+1
1,"Q. 2. What is dispersion ? What happens when light is passed through a glass prism. [Board Term II, Set (67001), 2012]",Ans. The process of splitting up of white light into its constituent colour as it passes through a refracting medium is known as dispersion of light. It bends towards the base of the prism after passing through it. 
2,"Q. 3. (i) A beam of white light splits when it passes through a prism. Name this phenomenon and give its reason. (ii) List the colours into which it splits in the decreasing order of their bending on emergence from prism. [Board Term II, Set (2045), 2012]","Ans. (i) Dispersion. White light consists of seven colours of different wavelengths. These components of light travel with different speeds in glass and get refracted by different angles. Due to this, splitting of white light takes place. (ii) Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red.  1 + 1"
3,"Q. 4. Define angle of deviation. Why do different components of white light split up into spectrum when it passes through a triangular glass prism ? [Board Term II, Set (67002), 2012]",Ans. The angle between the extended incident ray and the emergent ray is called the angle of deviation. 1 This is because the different colours travel through a glass prism at different speeds. 
4,Q. 5. What is scattering of light ? Explain with the help of an example. ,Ans. The phenomenon of change in the direction of propagation of light caused by the large number of particles present in the atmosphere is called scattering of light. Example : The path of beam of light becomes visible through a colloidal solution due to scattering of light.
5,Q. 6. Why Spectrum is formed when white light is passed through a glass prism ? ,Ans. Each colour has a definite wavelength and for each wavelength the angle of deviation differs. Red is the least deviated and violet is the most deviated colour so different colour deviate at different angles to form spectrum.

6,Q. 7. Why do stars appears to twinkle ? Explain. ,"Ans. Stars are very distant and approximate pointsized sources. Path of star light changes continuously due to gradual changing of refractive index of the layers of air. Thus, the apparent position of the stars fluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers giving the twinkling effect. "
7,Q. 8. An object placed behind the fire or a hot surface appears to flicker when seen through the air. Give reason why ? ,"Ans. The air above hot surface becomes hot and rises. The space is occupied by cool air. The refractive White light index of hot air is less than that of cool air. So, the physical condition of the medium are not constant. Due to changing Refractive Index (RI) of medium, the light appears to come from different directions. It results in fluctuation in apparent position of object."
8,"Q. 9. During sunrise and sunset sky appears red while during the day it appears blue. Explain these natural phenomenon. [Board Term II, Set (2045), 2012]","Ans.		 This is because of scattering of light. 		 Light from the sun near the horizon passes through larger distance in the earth’s atmosphere before reaching our eyes. So, most of the blue light and shorter wavelengths are scattered away by the particles. Therefore, the light that reaches our eyes is of longer wavelengths. This gives rise to the reddish appearance. But during the day shorter wavelength are scattered more by molecules of air and scattered blue light enters our eyes.  1"
9,Q. 10. Explain why the planets do not twinkle.  ,"Ans. Planets, being closer to earth, are seen as extended sources. If we consider a planet as a collection of large number of point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the amount of light entering our eye due to gradual change of refractive index of the atmosphere from all individual, point-sized sources will average out to zero. This nullifies the twinkling effect. "
10,Q. 14. (i) Why do parallel rays of different colours deviate differently while passing through a glass prism ? (ii) Name any two phenomenon associated with the formation of a rainbow.  ,"Ans. (i) Parallel rays of different colours deviate differently while passing through a glass prism because angle of refraction of different colours are different hence there is difference in refractive index. (ii) (a) Total Internal reflection, (b) Refraction."
11,Q. 15. Why does the sun look reddish at the time of sunrise and sunset ? Explain. ,"Ans. At the time of sunrise or sunset when the sun is near the horizon, the sunlight has to travel the larger distance through the atmosphere to reach us. During this long journey of sunlight, most of the shorter wavelength blue-colour present in it is scattered out and away from our line of sight. So, the light reaching us at the time of sunrise and sunset consists mainly of longer wavelength red colour due to which it appears to be red."
12,Q. 11. Why do different colours get separated when white light passes through a prism ? How can we recombine the components of white light after a prism has separated them. Explain. ,Ans. A spectrum is the band of distinct colours we obtain when the white light is splitted by a prism. We can recombine the component of white light by passing them through a prism placed upside down near the given prism. When we pass white light through two identical prisms held side by side with their refracting edges in opposite directions; the first prism disperses white light but the second prism recombines them. Thus light emerging from second prism is white.
13,Q. 12. Why danger signs are made in red colour ? ,"Ans. Red is the least scattered colour. It is least scattered by fog and smoke and can be seen in the same colour over a long distance. So, danger signs are made in red colour."
14,"Q. 13. Why did the clear sky appear blue ? [Board Term II, Set (2018), 2012; Set A1, 2011]  Why is the colour of the clear sky blue ? ","Ans. The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size smaller than the wavelength of the visible light. These are more effective in scattering light of shorter wavelength at the blue end than the light of longer wavelength at the red end. Thus, the blue colour is due to the scattering of sunlight through fine particles in air. Red Violet Labelling 1 "
15,"Q. 17. Stars twinkle while the planets do not. Why ? [Board Term II, Set (2008) 2012, Set B1, 2011]","Ans. Continuously changing atmosphere refract light from the stars by different amounts from one moment to the other. When atmosphere refracts more starlight towards us, the stars appears to be bright and when the atmosphere refracts less starlight, then the stars appear to be dim. However the planets are nearer to us than the stars, they appears to be comparatively bigger to us so they cannot be considered as a point source, hence no twinkling is seen."
16,Q. 1. State the cause of dispersion of white light passing through a glass prism. How did Newton show that white light of sun contains seven colours using two identical glass prisms. Draw a ray diagram to show the path of light when two identical glass prisms are arranged together in inverted position with respect to each other and a narrow beam of white light is allowed to fall obliquely on one of the focus of the first prism.  ,"Ans. Cause of dispersion of white light : Different colours of light bend through different angles with respect to the incident ray as they pass through a prism. Violet light bends the most and red the least. Thus, the each colour emerges along different paths. White light P1 Screen White light  2"
17,Q. 2. What is meant by scattering of light ? The sky appears blue and the sun appears reddish at sunrise and sunset. Explain these phenomena with reason.  What is the difference of colours of the sun observed during sunrise/sunset and noon ? Give explanation of each ? ,Ans. (i) Scattering of light – Phenomenon of spreading of light (diffused reflection) by minute particles in a medium. (ii) The sky appears blue because the blue colour of sunlight scatters much more strongly than the red colour by particles in atmosphere/ air due to its shorter wavelength. (iii) At sun-rise and sun-set most of the blue light and shorter wavelengths are scattered away by the particles in the atmosphere as the light from the sun near the horizon passes through thick layers of air and larger distance. The light that reaches us is of longer wavelength (red colour) giving a reddish appearance. 
18,Q. 3. How does refraction of light take place in the atmosphere ? Explain the reason why stars appear to twinkle and the planets do not twinkle.  (3 marks each),"Ans. l Since the atmosphere consists of varying densities the apparent position of the object, as seen through the hot air fluctuates. This wavering of light is an effect on atmospheric refraction. 1 l The twinkling of a star is due to atmosphere refraction of star light. The atmospheric refraction of light occurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. The planets are much closer to the earth and are thus seen as extended sources. A planet is considered as a collection of large number of point sized sources of light, the total variation in the amount of light entering our eye from all individual point sized sources will average out to zero, thereby nullifying the twinkling effect."
19,Q. 4. Define angle of deviation. Why do different components of white light split up into spectrum when it passes through a triangular glass prism ? Show the angle of deviation for red colour when white light passes through a prism. ,Ans. The angle between the extended incident ray and the emergent ray is called the angle of deviation. This is because the different colours travel through a glass prism at different speeds. Deviation of red light Visible light Angular spread Screen
20,Q. 5. Name the phenomenon responsible for the early sunrise and delayed sunset. Explain with the help of a diagram the reason why the sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual sun-rise and about 2 minutes after the actual sunset. ,"Ans. l Atmospheric refraction. Apparent position of the sun Horizon Observer Earth Atmosphere The sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual sunrise, and about 2 minutes after the actual sunset because of atmospheric refraction."

22,Q. 7. (i) Define power of a lens and write its SI unit.,Ans. (i) Reciprocal of focal length expressed in metres is called power. SI unit is dioptre.
23,Q. 8. State Snell’s law of refraction of light. Express it mathematically. Write the relationship between absolute refraction index of a medium and speed of light in vacuum. ,"Ans. The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sin of angle of refraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for the given pair of media. sin i = constant sin r Speed of ligh in air/vacuum c nm = Speed of light in the medium vm  2"
24,Q. 9. State the difference in colours of the sun observed during sunrise/sunset and noon. Give explanation for each ? sunset ? Draw a labelled diagram to explain these phenomena. ,"Ans. The sun rays have to travel through a larger atmospheric distance. As λb < λr, most of the blue light and shorter wavelengths are removed by scattering. Only red colour, which is least scattered is received by our eye and appears to come from sun. Hence the appearance of sun at sunset or sunrise or full noon near the horizon may look reddish."
25,"Q. 10. Why does the sun appear reddish early in the morning ? Will this phenomenon be observed by an observer on the moon ? Justify your answer with a reason. [Board Term II, Delhi Set-I, 2016] Why does the sun appear reddish early in the morning ? ","Ans. Early in the morning, the sun is near the horizon, sunlight reaches us after travelling a longer distance through thick layers of atmosphere. Thus most of the blue light and shorter wavelengths are scattered away by the particles in the atmosphere. The light that reaches us is of longer wavelengths giving a reddish appearance. This phenomenon will not be observed by an observer on the moon. Because of the absence of atmosphere on the moon.  ½"
26,Q. 11. What is meant by advance sunrise and delayed sunset ?,"Ans. Due to atmospheric refraction, the sun is visible to us about two minutes before the actual sun-rise and about two minutes after the actual sun-set. 1  2"
27,Q. 12. Enlist at least six phenomena observed in nature subsequent to the scattering of light.,Ans. The various phenomena observed in nature due to scattering of light are the following : (i) Sun appears red near the horizons (during sunrise and sunset) and white when seen overhead. (ii) Bluish colour of the sky. (iii) Visible path of light as it enters a dark room. (iv) Danger signals or stop signals are usually red. (v) Blueness of distant mountains. (vi) Sunlight filtering through clouds.
28,Q. 13. Explain in brief the reason for each of the  following : (i) The sun appears reddish during sun-rise. (ii) At noon the sun appears white. (iii) To an astronaut the sky appears dark instead of blue. ,"Ans. (i) During morning, sun rays travel large distances in the earth’s atmosphere, and in this process the shorter wavelengths scatter away and only large wave length (red light) reaches us. (ii) At noon, sun is overhead and light rays travel comparatively smaller distance and only little of blue / violet light scatter, so sun appears white. 1 (iii) No atmosphere in outer space for scattering, so sky appears dark. "
29,Q. 14. (i) “Stars seem higher than they actually are” (ii) “The sky appears dark to passengers flying at very high altitudes” Justify these statements with reason. ,"Ans. (i) Light coming from the stars are supposed to travel in a straight line. But the refractive index of air is not same throughout. It changes as hot air is rarer than cold air. So refraction takes place. In this case, starlight continuously travels from a rarer medium to a denser medium. Hence, it continuously bends towards the normal. The continuous bending of starlight towards the normal results in a rise of the apparent position of the star. (ii) Scattering of light take place because of the particles present in atmosphere. At high altitude due to absence of atmosphere scattering of light do not take place and hence sky appears dark to passengers flying at high altitude. "
30,Q. 15. Describe an activity to show that the colours of white light splitted by a glass prism can be recombined to get white light by another identical glass-prism. Also draw ray diagram to show the recombination of the spectrum of white light. ,"Ans. Description of activity : When a glass prism is used to obtain a spectrum of sunlight, a second identical prism in an inverted position with respect to the first position will allow all the colours of spectrum to recombine. Thus a beam of white light will emerge from the other side of the second prism. For Diagram See Topic 2, S.A.T.Q.II (1).  1½ "
31,Q. 16. Explain in brief the reason for each of the following :  (i) Advanced sun-rise (ii) Delayed sun-set (iii) Twinkling of stars,"Ans.(i) Advanced sun-rise : When the sun is slightly below the horizon, light rays coming from the sun travel from the rarer to denser medium layers of air because of atmospheric refraction of light, light appears to come from a higher position above the horizon. Thus the sun appear earlier than actual sun rise. (ii) Delayed sun-set : Same reason as similar refraction occurs at the sunset. Apparent position of the Sun Observer Horizon  Atmosphere (iii) Twinkling of stars : The light coming from the stars gets refracted several times before reaching the observers eye. Due to change in physical condition of the atmosphere the light sometimes reaches the observer and sometimes it doesn’t, hence they appear to twinkle. "
32,Q. 17. Why does the sun seem to rise two minutes before the actual sunrise and set two minutes after the actual sunset ? Explain with the help of labelled diagram. ,"Ans. The Sun is visible to us two minutes before the sunrise and two minutes after the sunset because of the bending of the light due to atmospheric refraction. The actual sunrise takes place when the Sun is just above the horizon. But due to atmospheric refraction of light, we see the Sun about two minutes before it is actually above the horizon. When the Sun is slightly below the horizon, its light moves from less dense air to more dense air and gets refracted towards the normal. Because of this atmospheric refraction, the Sun appears to be above the horizon when it is actually slightly below the horizon. It is also due to atmospheric refraction that we can still see the Sun for about two minutes even after it has set below the horizon. Actual position of the sun (Just below horizon) Atmospheric refraction As seen from the earth"
33,Q. 18. Explain giving reason why the sky appears blue to an observer from the surface of the earth ? What will the colour of the sky be for an astronaut staying in the international space station orbiting the earth ? Justify your answer giving reason. ,"Ans. Sunlight reaches the Earth’s atmosphere and is scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more than the other colours because it has the shortest wavelength. This is why the sky appears blue to an observer from the surface of the Earth. For an astronaut staying in the international space station orbiting the Earth, the colour of the sky will be black because the light reaching it does not scatter. Earth"
34,"Q. 19. Explain with the help of labelled diagram, the cause of twinkling of stars.","Ans. Light coming from the stars undergoes refraction on entering the Earth’s atmosphere. This refraction continues until it reaches the Earth’s surface. This happens because of uneven heating of atmospheric air. Hence, the atmospheric air has changing refractive index at various altitudes. In this case, starlight continuously travels from a rarer medium to a denser medium. Hence, it continuously bends towards the normal. Apparent position Refractive index increases with decrease in altitude Real position The refractive index of air medium gradually increases with a decrease in altitude. The continuous bending of starlight towards the normal results in a slight rise of the apparent position of the star. Apparent position Real position Refractive index of air increasing Since the physical conditions of the Earth’s atmosphere keeps changing, the apparent position of the star is not stationary. The star changes its position continuously, which makes it twinkle. This happens because starlight travels a very large distance before reaching the observer. However, the path varies continuously because of uneven atmospheric conditions. Hence, the stars seem to be fluctuating, sometimes appearing brighter and sometimes fainter. All this together, gives rise to the twinkling effect of stars. The sun appears to be above the horizon l l"
