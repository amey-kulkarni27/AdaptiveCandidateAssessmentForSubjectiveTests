0,Q. 1. (i) What is dispersion of white light ? State its cause.,"Ans. (i) Definition of Dispersion : Splitting of white light into seven constituent colours by a prism. 1 Cause of dispersion : When white light passes through a glass prism, different constituent colours bend through different angles with respect to the incident ray and hence are separated."
1,"Q. 2. (i) Define dispersion of light. How is scattering of light different from dispersion ? Give one example of natural phenomenon based on each of these. (ii) A beam of light consisting of red, blue and yellow is incident on the prisms as shown below. Complete the diagram to show refracted and emergent ray.  R+B+Y B+ R+","Ans. (i) Breaking up of the component colours of light is called dispersion. Dispersion is caused due to difference in velocity of each colour through a medium. Scattering of light takes place due to interaction of light and particles suspended in a medium. Rainbow–dispersion. Blue colour of sky, red colour of sky at sunrise or or sunset–scattering.

2,Q. 4. (a) A student suffering from myopia is not able to see distinctly the objects placed beyond 5 m. List two (b),"Ans. possible reasons due to which this defect of vision may have arisen. With the help of ray diagrams, explain (i) why the student is unable to see distinctly the objects placed beyond 5 m from his eyes. (ii) the type of corrective lens used to restore proper vision and how hi defect is corrected by the use of this lens. If, in this case, the numerical value of the focal length of the corrective lens is 5 m, find the power of lens as per the new Cartesian sign convention.   Detailed Answer : (a) (i) The student is unable to see distinctly the objects placed beyond 5 m from his eyes as he is suffering from myopia i.e., near-sightedness wherein a person can see near by objects clearly but cannot see distant objects distinctly. (ii) Concave lens can be used as the corrective lens to restore proper vision. A concave lens of suitable power will bring the image back on to the retina and thus the defect is corrected.

3,Q. 5. What is atmospheric refraction ? Use this phenomenon to explain the following natural events.  (i) Twinkling of stars. (ii) Advanced sun-rise and delayed sun-set. Draw diagrams to illustrate your answers.,"Ans. Atmospheric refraction : Refraction of light caused by the earth’s atmosphere due to change in the refractive indices of different layers. Apparent (i) Twinkling of stars : Stars are distant point sized source of light. The path of the rays of light coming from the star goes on varying due to atmospheric refraction slightly. Thus apparent position of the stars fluctuates and the amount of star light entering the eye flickers giving the twinkling effect. (ii) Advanced sun-rise : When the sun is slightly below the horizon, light rays coming from the sun travel from the rarer to denser layers of air. Because of atmospheric refraction of light, light appears to come from a higher position above the horizon. Thus sun appears earlier than actual sunrise. Delayed sunset : Same reason as similar refraction occurs at the sunset. Star star position Ray path Refractive index increasing  1 For Diagram See Topic 2, S.A.T.Q.II (5) "
4,"Q. 6. (a) Describe an activity along with a labelled diagram the phenomenon of dispersion through a prism. (b) Explain in brief the formation of rainbow with the help of figure. [Board Term II, Foreign Set-III, 2014 Set 8XSVHLC, QNA4XWT]","Ans. (a) Place a prism on a white sheet of paper with the triangular face on the sheet and trace its boundary ABC. (i) Fix two pins T and S on one side. (ii) Place the prism on the boundary ABC. (iii) Looking through the other side fix two more pins Q and R in such a way that the all four pins appear to be in the same line. (iv) Remove the pins and mark their positions. (v) Join TS and RQ and extend them to meet the faces of the prism at P and O respectively. (vi) Join PO. (vii) TP represents the incident ray. (viii) PO represents the refracted ray. (ix) And OR represents the emergent ray which is bent towards the base. (x) Let PN and ON be the normal at the points P and O respectively. (xi) And let i be the angle of incidence and r the angle of refraction. (xii) If the incident ray TP is extended forward and the emergent ray RO backwards, they meet at M, forming the angle OML. (xiii) Measure the angle OML. (xiv) This angle is called the angle of deviation. (xv) Angle of deviation is the angle through which an incident ray deviates. (xvi) Repeat this for different values of angle of incidence. i r N' M' F ∠ i – Angle of incidence ∠ r – Angle of refraction ∠ e – Angle of emergence ∠ D – Angle of deviation (b) Rainbow forms when sunlight hits the water droplets suspended in the atmosphere and undergoes total internal reflection. When the sunlight comes out of the drop it disperses, where the drop acts like a small prism. This dispersion or breaking up of light into several colours forms the Rainbow.

5,Q. 7. (i) A person’s image when seen through a stream of hot air arising above a fire disperse to waver. Explain. (ii) Define dispersion. How does a prism disperse white light ?  (iii) Which colour of light bends the most and the least?,"Ans. (i) In the region above the fire, the hot air is lighter than the cool air above it. Further the refractive index of hotter region is less than the cooler region and it is not static. These physical conditions are not steady. Subsequently the image when seen through the hot region is not stationary. The apparent position of the object fluctuates. This gives the wavering effect to the image. (ii) The phenomenon of obtaining a spectrum of colours by passing white light through the prism is known as dispersion. Dispersion occurs because the refraction of different colours travel with different speeds in a refracting medium. Speed of violet colour is least and that of the red colour is the most. Hence the refractive index of the medium is largest for violet colour and least for the red colour. (iii) As a result, the refraction or bending of violet colour is the maximum and that of red colour is minimum. This difference in the extent of bending of different colour of light causes dispersion of white light into its constituent colours as they emerge out of prism. Red colour bends the least and violet bends the most."
6,Q. 8. (a) Write an activity for observing scattering of light in colloidal solution. (b) On the basis of this activity explain why sky appears red at sunrise or sunset. ,Ans. (a) (i) Place a strong source of white light at the focus of converging lens. 		(ii) Allow the light beam to pass through a transparent glass tank containing clear water. In that clear water dissolve 200g of sodium thiosulphate in about 2 L of clean water in the tank and add 1 to 2 mL of conc. H2SO4 acid. 		(iii) Allow the beam of light to pass through a circular hole made in a cardboard. Obtain a sharp image of circular hole on screen by using converging lens. (b) At sunrise or sunset light travels long distance through thick layers of atmosphere. Blue and other lower wavelength get scattered and only red light reaches earth.
