Define the SI unit of potential difference. ,If amount of work done in bringing a one coulomb charge from one point to the other is 1 joule then potential difference between two points is said to be 1 volt. 
"What is meant by potential difference between two points ? [Board Term I, Set (21) 2011]",Potential difference between two points in an electric field is the amount of work done to move a unit charge from one point to other.
Name the device that helps to maintain a potential difference across a conductor. ,A battery is used to maintain potential difference across a conductor.
"Name the physical quantity which is same in all the resistors when they are connected in series. [Board Term I, Set (42) 2011]",Electric current.
"State the relationship between 1 ampere and 1 coulomb. [Board Term I, Set (36), 2011] 1 coulomb",1 ampere = 1 second
