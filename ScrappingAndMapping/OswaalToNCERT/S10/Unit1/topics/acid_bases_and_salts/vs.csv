1,"Q. 2. Name the acid present in ant sting. [Board Term-I Set (C1), 2010] ",Ans. Formic acid (Methanoic acid) HCOOH. 
2,Q. 3. Which solution is used to dissolve gold ? ,Ans. Aqua-regia (3 parts HCl : 1 parts HNO3)
3,Q. 4. What happens when egg shell is added to nitric acid ? ,Ans. Egg shell is made up of Calcium carbonate. When added to nitric acid it gives effervescence due to the evolution of CO2 gas. 2HNO3 + CaCO3 → 2Ca(NO3)2 + H2O + CO2 1
4,"Q. 5. Fresh milk has a pH of 6. When it changes into curd (Yogurt), will its pH value increases or decreases ? Why ? ","Ans. When milk changes into curd, its pH will decrease. Because curd contain acid so H+ increases and thus pH will decrease. (1 mark each)"
5,Q. 6. How will you test a gas which is liberated when HCl acid reacts with an active metal ? ,Ans. It liberates H2 gas which burns with a pop sound. 1
6,Q. 7. Which gas is usually liberated when an acid reacts with a metal ? ,Ans. Hydrogen gas.
7,"Q. 8. When conc. acid is added to water, whether the process is exothermic or endothermic ? ","Ans. After adding acid to water, dissociation of acid take place forming hydration of ions. As breaking of bonds, needs some energy to proceed, It is endothermic reaction."
8,Q. 9. Why does flow of acid rain water into a river make the survival of aquatic life in the river difficult ? ,Ans. When pH of rain water is less than 5.6 it is called acid rain. Living organisms can survive only in a narrow range of pH change.

10,"Q. 11. Which is a stronger acid, with pH = 5 or with pH = 2 ? ","Ans. pH = 2 (lower the pH, stronger the acid)."
11,Q. 12. What is the effect of an increase in concentration of H+ ions ? 1 M HCl or 1 M CH3COOH. ,"Ans. 1 M HCl has a higher concentration of H+ ions, because when HCl dissolves in water it dissociates completely into ions while CH3COOH is a weak acid and does not dissociate into ions completely."
12,Q. 13. Why does tooth decay start when the pH of mouth is lower than 5.5 ? ,"Ans. At lower pH below 5.5, the calcium phosphate of enamel of tooth gets corroded."
13,"Q. 14. How is the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+) affected, when a solution of an acid is diluted ? ","Ans. When a solution of an acid is diluted i.e., water is added to it, the concentration of H3O+ ions per unit volume decreases."
