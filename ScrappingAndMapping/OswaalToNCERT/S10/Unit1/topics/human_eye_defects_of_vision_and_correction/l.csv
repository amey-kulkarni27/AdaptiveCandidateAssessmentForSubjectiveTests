State the function of each of the following parts of the human eye : (i) Cornea (ii) Iris (iii) Pupil (iv) Retina  Millions of people of the developing countries are suffering from corneal blindness. This disease can be cured by replacing the defective cornea with the cornea of a donated eye. Your school has organised a campaign in the school and its neighbourhood in order to create awareness about this fact and motivate people to donate their eyes after death. How can you along with your classmates contribute in this noble cause ? State the objectives of organising such campaigns in schools.,"(i) Cornea—Refraction of the light rays falling on the eye. (ii) Iris—To control the size of the pupil. (iii) Pupil—To regulate and control the amount of light entering the eye. (iv) Retina—To act as a screen to obtain the image of object and generate electrical signals which are sent to the brain via optic nerves. l Ways of motivating people for the noble cause of eye donation are street play, Banners, Posters, door to door campaign etc.. Objectives— (i) To develop the habit of group work. (ii) To work for a common cause. (iii) To understand social issues and problems. "
A person is unable to see distinctly the words printed on a newspaper. Name the defect of vision he is suffering from. Draw ray diagram to illustrate this defect. List its two possible causes. Draw a ray diagram to show how this defect may be corrected using a lens of appropriate focal length. ,l Hypermetropia/ Long-sightedness l Defective eye N'  l Two causes : (i) The focal length of the eye lens is too long. 1 (ii) The eyeball has become too small. l Correction of the defect using appropriate lens
Name the eye defect in which eye lens becomes cloudy or milky. Mention the method for its correction. A person uses a lens of power –1.0 D for correcting his distant vision and for correcting his near vision he uses a lens of power + 2.0 D. Calculate the focal length of the lenses required to correct these defects. Explain why a normal eye is not able to see clearly the objects placed closer than the near points. ,"(i) Sometime, the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky and cloudy. This condition is called cataract. This causes partial or complete loss of vision. 		 It is possible to restore vision through a cataract surgery. (ii) Focal length for lens for distance vision = – = – 1m Focal length for lens for near vision =+ 0.5 m (iii) The focal length of eye lens cannot be decreased below a certain minimum limit. If we try to read a printed page by holding it very close to our eyes, we may see the image being blurred or feel strain in the eye. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, we must hold it at about 25 cm from the eyes.  5"
A student is unable to see clearly the words written on the blackboard placed at a distance of approximately 4 m from him. Name the defect of vision the boy is suffering from. Explain the method of correcting this defect. Draw ray diagram for the : (i) defect of vision and also (ii) For its correction.  A student has difficulty reading the blackboard while sitting in the last row. What could be the defect the child suffering from ? How can it be corrected ?,"Myopia on short–sightedness : Inability of an eye in viewing long distance objects. The image in this case falls before the retina. For every myopic eye, there exists a far point beyond which clear image cannot be seen. The short–sightedness is corrected by using a concave lens which diverges and shifts the image to the retina. Parallel rays coming from distant object Retina image Parallel rays coming L from distant object Retina Virtual image formed at F "
(i) List the parts of the human eye that control the amount of light entering into it. Explain how they perform this function. (ii) Write the function of retina in human eye. (iii) Do you know that the corneal-impairment can be cured by replacing the defective cornea with the cornea of the donated eye ? How and why should we organise groups to motivate the community members to donate their eyes after death ? ,"(i) The pupil is the perforation in the iris. It is the pupil (or aperture of the eye) through which light enters our eyes. The relaxation and contraction of the muscular fibres of the iris regulate the opening and closing of the pupil. Hence, it is the pupil that controls the amount of light entering our eyes. (ii) The retina is the “film” of the eye like the film of a camera. The retina is the light-sensing part of the eye. It converts the incident light into electrical signals and sends them to the brain. (iii) Eyes of a dead person can be donated to a person having corneal blindness. It will help him/her to see the world. We can also register ourselves to donate our eyes. The organisations that put up eye donation camps preserve our eyes after our death and donate them to the needy."
(i) List three common refractive defects of vision. Suggest the way of correcting these defects. (ii) About 45 lac people in the developing countries are suffering from corneal blindness. About 30 lac children below the age of 12 years suffering from this defect can be cured by replacing the defective cornea with the cornea of a donated eye. How and why can students of your age involve themselves to create awareness about this fact among people ? ,(i) The three common refractive defects of vision are as follows : Myopia (short-sightedness) : It is corrected by using spectacles having concave lenses of appropriate power. Hypermetropia (far-sightedness) : It is corrected by using spectacles having convex lenses of appropriate power. Presbyopia : This defect is corrected using bifocal lenses of appropriate power in which the upper part consists of a concave lens (to correct myopia) and the lower part consists of a convex lens (to correct hypermetropia). (ii) Eyes of a dead person can be donated to the person having corneal blindness. It will help him/her see the world. We can also register ourselves to eye donation camps who can preserve our eyes after our death and donate them to the needy.
(a) State the reasons which lead to hypermetropia. With the help of suitable diagram explain this defect of vision and its correction.,"(a) This defect arises either because : (i) the focal length of the eye lens is too long, or (ii) the eyeball has become too small. Such a person has to keep a reading material much beyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable reading. This is because the light rays from a nearby object are focused at a point behind the retina. Correction of Hypermetropia : (i) This defect can be corrected by using a convex lens of appropriate power. (ii) Eye-glasses with converging lenses provide the additional focusing power required for forming the image on the retina."
(i) Name the defect of vision in which the eye loses its power of accommodation due to old age.,(i) Presbyopia
