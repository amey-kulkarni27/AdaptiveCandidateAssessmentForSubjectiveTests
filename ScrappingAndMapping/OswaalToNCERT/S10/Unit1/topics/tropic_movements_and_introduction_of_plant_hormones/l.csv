0,Q. 1. What are plant hormones ? Give four different types of plant hormones and state their functions briefly.  ,"Ans. The chemical compounds released by stimulated cells for control and coordination in plants are called plant hormones or phytohormones. Auxin - controls growth Gibberellins - helps growth in stem Cytokinin - promotes cell division Abscisic acid - Inhibits growth, wilting of leaves 5 "
1,"Q. 2. (a) Write the names and one function of each of any three growth hormones in plants. (b) In the absence of muscle cells, how do plant cells show movement ? ","Ans. (a) Three growth hormones in plants are— 		(i) Auxin : It is synthesised in the young tip of roots and shoots. It promotes elongation and division of cell and root formation. 		(ii) Gibberellins : They help in the growth of the stem. 		(iii) Cytokinins : They promote cell division and delay leaf ageing. (b) The ability of a plant to detect change and respond to that change is termed as the sensitivity of the plant. Yet plants have no nervous system and no muscle tissue, they use electrical and chemical (5 marks each) means to convey the information from one cell to another cell. The leaves of the sensitive plant (Mimosa Pudica) folds up in response to touch. These leaf movements are independent of growth whereas, the directional movement of the shoot of a germinating seedling breaking through the soil is growth dependent."
2,"Q. 3. A natural occurring class of plant hormones cytokinins has been found to help increase cotton yields during drought conditions. It has been observed that young cotton seedlings have small root system, making it difficult for them to reach available soil water. Cytokinins assists the young plants in water stress defences, promoting the plant to quickly build a bigger root system to access deep soil moisture. To be effective this phytohormone should be applied at an early stage of development. (i) What are phytohormones ? (ii) Which hormone is synthesized at the shoot-tip of plant body ? (iii) ‘‘Plant hormones help to co-ordinate growth.’’ Justify the statement by giving three examples.",Ans. (i) Plant hormones are known as phytohormones. 1 (ii) Auxin is synthesized at the shoot-tip of plant body. (iii) Examples : 		(a) Auxins play a role in the development of seedless fruits. 		(b) Gibberellin stimulates stem elongation. 		(c) Ethylene promotes ripening of fruits.
