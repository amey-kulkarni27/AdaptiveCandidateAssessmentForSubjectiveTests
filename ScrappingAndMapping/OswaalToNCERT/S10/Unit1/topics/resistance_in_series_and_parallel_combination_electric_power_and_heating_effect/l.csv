1,Q. 4. (i) Derive an expression for Joule’s law of heating. (ii) Give two examples for applications of heating effect of electric current. (iii) 100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4Ω resistor. Find the potential difference across the resistor. ,"Ans. (i) P = VI H = P × t = VIt 		But V = IR (Ohm’s law) H = I2Rt (ii) (a) Electric fuse 			(b) Electric water heater (iii) H = 100 J, R = 4 Ω, t = 1 sec. H = I2Rt I2 = Rt I = Rt = 25 = 5 Ampere. 		Now, V = IR V =5×4 V = 20 V. "
2,"Q. 5. (i) A wire of resistivity r is stretched to double it’s length which is it’s new resistivity. Give reason for your answer. (ii) Draw a schematic diagram of a circuit consisting of a battery of three cells of 2V each, a 5Ω resistor, 8Ω resistor and 12Ω resistor and a plug key all connected in series. (iii) Two wires, one of copper and other of manganese have equal lengths and equal resistances : Which is thicker. (Given that resistivity of manganese is lower than that of copper.)  ","Ans. (i) Resistivity remains unchanged because resistivity depends on nature of material not on length. 2V 2V 2V (ii) batter y resisters 12 W (iii) 		Now, 8W Rcopper = ρc Rm = ρm 5W lc Ac lm Am Rc = Rm (given) lc = lm (given) ρm ρ = m Ac Am ρc = c or ρm Am 		Since, ρm < ρc Am < A c 			Copper wire will be thicker.

3,"Q. 6. (i) Derive an expression for the equivalent resistance of three resistors R1, R2 and R3 connected in series. (ii) Fuse of 3A, 5A and 10A are available. Calculate and select the fuse for operating electric iron of 1 kW power at 220 V line.","Ans. (i) Total potential difference across a combination of resistors in series is equal to the sum of potential difference across the individual resistors. V = V 1 + V2 + V3 			Let I be the current in the circuit. The current through each resistor is also I. 			It is possible to replace the three resistors joined in series by an equivalent resistor of resistance R. 		Applying Ohm’s law, V = IR On applying Ohm’s law to the three resistors respectively we further have V1 = IR1 V2 = IR2 V3 = IR3 R1 R2 R3 		But V = V 1 + V2 + V3 IR = IR1 + IR2 + IR3 R = R1 + R2 + R3 (ii)		Power rating of electric iron = 1 kW = 1000 W V = 220 V P = VI P 1000 I= V 220 = 4.55 A 		Hence, a fuse of rating 5A can be used because it can bear the current. "
4,Q. 7. (i) What is meant by the statement that the resistance of a wire is 1 Ω ?,"Ans. (i) When 1 ampere current flows through a conductor whose potential difference is 1 volt, then resistance is 1 ohm."
