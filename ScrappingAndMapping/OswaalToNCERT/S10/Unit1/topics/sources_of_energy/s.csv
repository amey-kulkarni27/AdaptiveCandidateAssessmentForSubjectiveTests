11,"Q. 12. Wood takes a long time to grow, but even then it is considered a renewable source of energy. Comment.","Ans. Although wood takes a long time, approximately 20 years, to grow, it is considered a renewable source of energy because the time taken is much smaller as compared to non-renewable sources of energy like– coal, petroleum, etc which take millions of years. 2"
12,Q. 13. Why does a car parked in sunlight remains hot from inside even when there is no sunlight in the car ?,"Ans. The glass windows have the peculiar property to pass radiations which have wavelength near to the visible light or shorter wavelength. It does not allow infra-red radiations of higher wavelength. Since the sun sends infra-red radiations of lower wavelengths, these pass through the glass windows, and gets trapped inside the car in the form of heat. This heat or infra-red radiations can not pass out and thus gets trapped in the car for longer time, making it hot from inside."

14,Q. 2. Explain the principle and working of a biogas plant. ,"Ans. The waste of living organisms like cow dung, various plant materials like the residue after harvesting of crops, vegetable waste and sewage etc. form biomass. During the decay of biomass, in the absence of oxygen, biogas is produced in the biogas plant. A slurry of cow dung and water is made in the mixing tank from where it is fed into the digester. In the digester tank, anaerobic micro-organisms decompose complex molecules of cowdung slurry and produce biogas.  3 Nuclear Fission Nuclear Fusion A large nucleus breaks Two smaller nuclei fuse or into two smaller nuclei join together to form own and releases a large nucleus and releases large amount of energy. amount of energy.

17,"Q. 6. If energy can neither be created nor destroyed, explain with an example why we should worry about our energy resources ? ","Ans. Energy used is dissipated in less usable form. The energy used is consumed and cannot be used again. Example : Burning of candle → light + heat but products cannot produce chemical energy (Or any other example)  3 Detailed Answer : The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. But, it can only be converted from one form to another. Despite this fact, the world is facing energy crisis. The reason behind it is that energy is converted into non-usable forms. Fossil fuels like coal, petroleum etc. are the sources of energy which have accumulated in nature over a long time and cannot be replaced. We should worry about such sources because these sources of energy are getting depleted and sooner or late, will no longer be available to us."
