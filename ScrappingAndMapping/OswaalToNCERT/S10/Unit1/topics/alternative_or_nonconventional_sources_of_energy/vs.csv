6,Q. 6. A black surface absorbs more heat radiations as compared to a white surface under identical conditions. List two solar devices which make use of this property in their design. ,"Ans. Each solar cell produces a voltage of 0.5 volt. Solar cooker, Solar panel."
7,Q. 7. List two forms of energy in which solar energy manifests itself in oceans. ,Ans. Tidal energy and Sea-wave energy.  (ii) Biomass energy
8,Q. 10. Why is a solar cooker painted black from outside ? ,Ans. A black surface absorbs more heat as compared to white or a reflecting surface. 
9,Q. 11. Mention the main purpose of using a plane mirror in solar cookers. ,Ans. Mirror in a solar cooker acts as a reflector of sunlight into the box. It increases the concentration of heat rays in the box.
10,Q. 12. Mention the purpose of blackening the interior of a solar cooker. ,Ans. Black surface absorbs more heat than a white or prevents heat loss.
11,"Q. 13. Why are black surfaces, and not the white surfaces, used for making solar cookers ?","Ans. Black surfaces absorb more heat as compared to white surfaces. Therefore, for making solar cookers, black surfaces are used."

13,Q. 15. What is a wind energy farm ? ,Ans. A number of windmills erected over a large area. 1
14,Q. 16. List two non-conventional sources of energy. ,Ans. Solar energy and Wind energy.
15,Q. 17. List any two advantages of using wind energy. ,Ans. (i) Environment friendly. (ii) Efficient source of renewable energy. (iii) No recurring expenditure. (Any two) 
16,Q. 18. What should be the minimum wind speed to maintain the required speed of the turbine in a wind energy farm ? ,Ans. 15 km/h.
17,Q. 19. List any two limitations in harnessing wind energy. ,Ans. (i) Wind energy farms can be established only at those places where wind blows for the major part of the year. (ii) Establishment of wind farms requires a large area of land.
18,"Q. 20. Windmill works with the energy of the blowing wind. Then, how is the supply of electricity maintained in a windmill when there is no wind ?","Ans. In a windmill, the electricity generated is stored in a battery. This battery provides electricity when there is no wind."
19,"Q. 21. Name two constituent of biogas, one should be chief constituent. ","Ans. Solar panels are those devices which are used to absorb the sun’s rays and convert them into electricity or heat. Uses of Solar Panels : (i) Solar panels are used in wide range electronics equipment. (ii) Radio, TV relay stations in remote locations use solar cell panels. (iii) The solar cells panels are mounted on specially designed inclined roof tops so that more solar energy is incident over it."
