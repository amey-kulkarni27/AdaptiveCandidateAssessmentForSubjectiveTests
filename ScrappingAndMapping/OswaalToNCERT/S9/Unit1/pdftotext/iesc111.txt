Chapter 11
WORK
In the previous few chapters we have talked
about ways of describing the motion of
objects, the cause of motion and gravitation.
Another concept that helps us understand and
interpret many natural phenomena is ‘work’.
Closely related to work are energy and power.
In this chapter we shall study these concepts.
All living beings need food. Living beings
have to perform several basic activities to
survive. We call such activities ‘life processes’.
The energy for these processes comes from
food. We need energy for other activities like
playing, singing, reading, writing, thinking,
jumping, cycling and running. Activities that
are strenuous require more energy.
Animals too get engaged in activities. For
example, they may jump and run. They have
to fight, move away from enemies, find food
or find a safe place to live. Also, we engage
some animals to lift weights, carry loads, pull
carts or plough fields. All such activities
require energy.
Think of machines. List the machines that
you have come across. What do they need for
their working? Why do some engines require
fuel like petrol and diesel? Why do living
beings and machines need energy?

11.1 Work
What is work? There is a difference in the
way we use the term ‘work’ in day-to-day life
and the way we use it in science. To make
this point clear let us consider a few examples.

11.1.1 NOT

‘WORK’
WORKING HARD!

ENERGY

draws diagrams, organises her thoughts,
collects question papers, attends classes,
discusses problems with her friends, and
performs experiments. She expends a lot of
energy on these activities. In common
parlance, she is ‘working hard’. All this ‘hard
work’ may involve very little ‘work’ if we go by
the scientific definition of work.
You are working hard to push a huge rock.
Let us say the rock does not move despite all
the effort. You get completely exhausted.
However, you have not done any work on the
rock as there is no displacement of the rock.
You stand still for a few minutes with a
heavy load on your head. You get tired. You
have exerted yourself and have spent quite a
bit of your energy. Are you doing work on the
load? The way we understand the term ‘work’
in science, work is not done.
You climb up the steps of a staircase and
reach the second floor of a building just to
see the landscape from there. You may even
climb up a tall tree. If we apply the scientific
definition, these activities involve a lot of work.
In day-to-day life, we consider any useful
physical or mental labour as work. Activities
like playing in a field, talking with friends,
humming a tune, watching a movie, attending
a function are sometimes not considered to
be work. What constitutes ‘work’ depends
on the way we define it. We use and define
the term work differently in science. To
understand this let us do the following
activities:

in day-to-day life. For each of these
activities, ask the following questions
and answer them:
(i) What is the work being done on?
(ii) What is happening to the object?
(iii) Who (what) is doing the work?

11.1.2 SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTION OF WORK
To understand the way we view work and
define work from the point of view of science,
let us consider some situations:
Push a pebble lying on a surface. The
pebble moves through a distance. You exerted
a force on the pebble and the pebble got
displaced. In this situation work is done.
A girl pulls a trolley and the trolley moves
through a distance. The girl has exerted a
force on the trolley and it is displaced.
Therefore, work is done.
Lift a book through a height. To do this
you must apply a force. The book rises up.
There is a force applied on the book and the
book has moved. Hence, work is done.
A closer look at the above situations
reveals that two conditions need to be
satisfied for work to be done: (i) a force should
act on an object, and (ii) the object must be
displaced.
If any one of the above conditions does
not exist, work is not done. This is the way
we view work in science.
A bullock is pulling a cart. The cart
moves. There is a force on the cart and the
cart has moved. Do you think that work is
done in this situation?

•
•

Think of situations when the object is
not displaced in spite of a force acting
on it.
Also think of situations when an object
gets displaced in the absence of a force
acting on it.
List all the situations that you can
think of for each.
Discuss with your friends whether
work is done in these situations.

11.1.3 WORK DONE BY A CONSTANT FORCE
How is work defined in science? To
understand this, we shall first consider the
case when the force is acting in the direction
of displacement.
Let a constant force, F act on an object.
Let the object be displaced through a
distance, s in the direction of the force (Fig.
11.1). Let W be the work done. We define work
to be equal to the product of the force and
displacement.
Work done = force × displacement
W = Fs

WORK

Think of some situations from your
daily life involving work.
List them.
Discuss with your friends whether
work is being done in each situation.
Try to reason out your response.
If work is done, which is the force acting
on the object?
What is the object on which the work
is done?
What happens to the object on which
work is done?
AND

Fig. 11.1

Thus, work done by a force acting on an
object is equal to the magnitude of the force
multiplied by the distance moved in the
direction of the force. Work has only
magnitude and no direction.
In Eq. (11.1), if F = 1 N and s = 1 m then
the work done by the force will be 1 N m.
Here the unit of work is newton metre (N m)
or joule (J). Thus 1 J is the amount of work
147

ENERGY

2021-22

done on an object when a force of 1 N
displaces it by 1 m along the line of action of
the force.
Look at Eq. (11.1) carefully. What is the
work done when the force on the object is
zero? What would be the work done when
the displacement of the object is zero? Refer
to the conditions that are to be satisfied to
say that work is done.
Example 11.1 A force of 5 N is acting on an
object. The object is displaced through
2 m in the direction of the force (Fig.
11.2). If the force acts on the object all
through the displacement, then work
done is 5 N × 2 m =10 N m or 10 J.

Fig. 11.2

Q

Fig. 11.4

Consider a situation in which an object is
moving with a uniform velocity along a
particular direction. Now a retarding force, F,
is applied in the opposite direction. That is,
the angle between the two directions is 180º.
Let the object stop after a displacement s. In
such a situation, the work done by the force,
F is taken as negative and denoted by the
minus sign. The work done by the force is
F × (–s) or (–F × s).
It is clear from the above discussion that
the work done by a force can be either positive
or negative. To understand this, let us do the
following activity:

Activity _____________ 11.4

uestion
1. A force of 7 N acts on an object.
The displacement is, say 8 m, in
the direction of the force
(Fig. 11.3). Let us take it that the
force acts on the object through
the displacement. What is the
work done in this case?

•

•
•
•

Fig. 11.3

Consider another situation in which the
force and the displacement are in the same
direction: a baby pulling a toy car parallel to
the ground, as shown in Fig. 11.4. The baby
has exerted a force in the direction of
displacement of the car. In this situation, the
work done will be equal to the product of the
force and displacement. In such situations,
the work done by the force is taken as positive.

Lift an object up. Work is done by the
force exerted by you on the object. The
object moves upwards. The force you
exerted is in the direction of
displacement. However, there is the
force of gravity acting on the object.
Which one of these forces is doing
positive work?
Which one is doing negative work?
Give reasons.

Work done is negative when the force acts
opposite to the direction of displacement.
Work done is positive when the force is in the
direction of displacement.
Example 11.2 A porter lifts a luggage of 15
kg from the ground and puts it on his
head 1.5 m above the ground. Calculate
the work done by him on the luggage.
Solution:
Mass of luggage, m = 15 kg and
displacement, s = 1.5 m.

of 140 N on a plough. The field
being ploughed is 15 m long.

ploughing the length of the field?

11.2 Energy
Life is impossible without energy. The demand
for energy is ever increasing. Where do we
get energy from? The Sun is the biggest
natural source of energy to us. Many of our
energy sources are derived from the Sun. We
can also get energy from the nuclei of atoms,
the interior of the earth, and the tides. Can
you think of other sources of energy?

A few sources of energy are listed above.
There are many other sources of
energy. List them.
Discuss in small groups how certain
sources of energy are due to the Sun.
Are there sources of energy which are
not due to the Sun?

11.2.1 FORMS OF ENERGY

The word energy is very often used in our
daily life, but in science we give it a definite
and precise meaning. Let us consider the
following examples: when a fast moving
cricket ball hits a stationary wicket, the wicket
is thrown away. Similarly, an object when
raised to a certain height gets the capability
to do work. You must have seen that when a
WORK

AND

raised hammer falls on a nail placed on a
piece of wood, it drives the nail into the wood.
We have also observed children winding a
toy (such as a toy car) and when the toy is
placed on the floor, it starts moving. When a
balloon is filled with air and we press it we
notice a change in its shape. As long as we
press it gently, it can come back to its original
shape when the force is withdrawn. However,
if we press the balloon hard, it can even
explode producing a blasting sound. In all
these examples, the objects acquire, through
different means, the capability of doing work.
An object having a capability to do work is
said to possess energy. The object which does
the work loses energy and the object on which
the work is done gains energy.
How does an object with energy do work?
An object that possesses energy can exert a
force on another object. When this happens,
energy is transferred from the former to the
latter. The second object may move as it
receives energy and therefore do some work.
Thus, the first object had a capacity to do
work. This implies that any object that
possesses energy can do work.
The energy possessed by an object is thus
measured in terms of its capacity of doing
work. The unit of energy is, therefore, the same
as that of work, that is, joule (J). 1 J is the
energy required to do 1 joule of work.
Sometimes a larger unit of energy called kilo
joule (kJ) is used. 1 kJ equals 1000 J.

Luckily the world we live in provides energy
in many different forms. The various forms
include mechanical energy (potential energy
+ kinetic energy), heat energy, chemical
energy, electrical energy and light energy.
Think it over !
How do you know that some entity is a
form of energy? Discuss with your friends
and teachers.

•

The trolley moves forward and hits the
wooden block.
Fix a stop on the table in such a
manner that the trolley stops after
hitting the block. The block gets
displaced.
Note down the displacement of the
block. This means work is done on the
block by the trolley as the block has
gained energy.
From where does this energy come?
Repeat this activity by increasing the
mass on the pan. In which case is the
displacement more?
In which case is the work done more?
In this activity, the moving trolley does
work and hence it possesses energy.

A moving object can do work. An object
moving faster can do more work than an
identical object moving relatively slow. A
moving bullet, blowing wind, a rotating wheel,
a speeding stone can do work. How does a
bullet pierce the target? How does the wind
move the blades of a windmill? Objects in
motion possess energy. We call this energy
kinetic energy.
A falling coconut, a speeding car, a rolling
stone, a flying aircraft, flowing water, blowing
wind, a running athlete etc. possess kinetic
energy. In short, kinetic energy is the energy
possessed by an object due to its motion. The
kinetic energy of an object increases with its
speed.
How much energy is possessed by a
moving body by virtue of its motion? By
definition, we say that the kinetic energy of a
body moving with a certain velocity is equal to
the work done on it to make it acquire that
velocity.

SCIENCE

Let us now express the kinetic energy of
an object in the form of an equation. Consider
an object of mass, m moving with a uniform
velocity, u. Let it now be displaced through a
distance s when a constant force, F acts on it
in the direction of its displacement. From
Eq. (11.1), the work done, W is F s. The work
done on the object will cause a change in its
velocity. Let its velocity change from u to v.
Let a be the acceleration produced.
In section 8.5, we studied three equations
of motion. The relation connecting the initial
velocity (u) and final velocity (v) of an object
moving with a uniform acceleration a, and
the displacement, s is
v2 – u2 = 2a s
(8.7)
This gives
s=

v2 – u 2
2a

(11.2)

From section 9.4, we know F = m a. Thus,
using (Eq. 11.2) in Eq. (11.1), we can write
the work done by the force, F as
v2 - u 2
W =ma ×
2a

(

Mass of the object, m = 15 kg, velocity

From Eq. (11.5),
Ek =

The kinetic energy of the object is 120 J.

Example 11.4 What is the work to be done
to increase the velocity of a car from
30 km h–1 to 60 km h–1 if the mass of
the car is 1500 kg?
Solution:
Mass of the car, m =1500 kg,
initial velocity of car, u = 30 km h–1
30 × 1000 m
60 × 60 s

= 25/3 m s–1.

Therefore, the initial kinetic energy of

AT A HEIGHT

An object increases its energy when raised
through a height. This is because work is
done on it against gravity while it is being
raised. The energy present in such an object
is the gravitational potential energy.
The gravitational potential energy of an
object at a point above the ground is defined
as the work done in raising it from the ground
to that point against gravity.
It is easy to arrive at an expression for
the gravitational potential energy of an object
at a height.

More to know

11.2.4 POTENTIAL ENERGY OF AN OBJECT

The potential energy of an object at
a height depends on the ground level
or the zero level you choose. An
object in a given position can have a
certain potential energy with respect
to one level and a different value of
potential energy with respect to
another level.

It is useful to note that the work done by
gravity depends on the difference in vertical
heights of the initial and final positions of
the object and not on the path along which
the object is moved. Fig. 11.8 shows a case
where a block is raised from position A to B
by taking two different paths. Let the height
AB = h. In both the situations the work done
on the object is mgh.

Fig. 11.7
Fig. 11.8

Consider an object of mass, m. Let it be
raised through a height, h from the ground.
A force is required to do this. The minimum
force required to raise the object is equal to
the weight of the object, mg. The object gains
energy equal to the work done on it. Let the
work done on the object against gravity be
W. That is,
work done, W = force × displacement
= mg × h
= mgh
Since work done on the object is equal to
mgh, an energy equal to mgh units is gained
by the object. This is the potential energy (EP)
of the object.
Ep = mgh

acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 m s–2.

Potential energy = mgh

11.2.6 LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
In activities 11.13 and 11.14, we learnt that
the form of energy can be changed from one
form to another. What happens to the total
energy of a system during or after the process?
Whenever energy gets transformed, the total
energy remains unchanged. This is the law of
conservation of energy. According to this law,
energy can only be converted from one form
to another; it can neither be created or
destroyed. The total energy before and after
the transformation remains the same. The law
of conservation of energy is valid
in
all situations and for all kinds of
transformations.
Consider a simple example. Let an object
of mass, m be made to fall freely from a height,
h. At the start, the potential energy is mgh and
kinetic energy is zero. Why is the kinetic
energy zero? It is zero because its velocity is
zero. The total energy of the object is thus mgh.
As it falls, its potential energy will change into
kinetic energy. If v is the velocity of the object
at a given instant, the kinetic energy would be
½mv2. As the fall of the object continues, the
potential energy would decrease while the
kinetic energy would increase. When the object
is about to reach the ground, h = 0 and v will
be the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy
would be the largest and potential energy the
least. However, the sum of the potential energy
and kinetic energy of the object would be the
same at all points. That is,
potential energy + kinetic energy = constant
or
mgh +

1
mv 2= constant.
2

(11.7)

The sum of kinetic energy and potential energy
of an object is its total mechanical energy.
We find that during the free fall of the object,
the decrease in potential energy, at any point
in its path, appears as an equal amount of
increase in kinetic energy. (Here the effect of
air resistance on the motion of the object has
been ignored.) There is thus a continual
transformation of gravitational potential
energy into kinetic energy.

A stronger person may do certain work in

would complete a journey in a shorter time
than a less powerful one. We talk of the power
of machines like motorbikes and motorcars.
The speed with which these vehicles change
energy or do work is a basis for their
classification. Power measures the speed of
work done, that is, how fast or slow work is
done. Power is defined as the rate of doing
work or the rate of transfer of energy. If an

For simplifying the calculations, take
the value of g as 10 m s–2.

Think it over !
What would have happened if nature had
not allowed the transformation of energy?
There is a view that life could not have
been possible without transformation of
energy. Do you agree with this?

11.3 Rate of Doing Work
Do all of us work at the same rate? Do
machines consume or transfer energy at the
same rate? Agents that transfer energy do
work at different rates. Let us understand this
from the following activity:

(11.8)

The unit of power is watt [in honour of
James Watt (1736 – 1819)] having the symbol
W. 1 watt is the power of an agent, which
does work at the rate of 1 joule per second.
We can also say that power is 1 W when the
rate of consumption of energy is 1 J s–1.
1 watt = 1 joule/second or 1 W = 1 J s–1.
We express larger rates of energy transfer in
kilowatts (kW).
1 kilowatt = 1000 watts
1 kW
= 1000 W
1 kW
= 1000 J s–1.
The power of an agent may vary with time.
This means that the agent may be doing work
at different rates at different intervals of time.
Therefore the concept of average power is
useful. We obtain average power by dividing
the total energy consumed by the total time
taken.
Example 11.7 Two girls, each of weight 400
N climb up a rope through a height of 8
m. We name one of the girls A and the
other B. Girl A takes 20 s while B takes
50 s to accomplish this task. What is the
power expended by each girl?

Consider two children, say A and B.
Let us say they weigh the same. Both
start climbing up a rope separately.
Both reach a height of 8 m. Let us say
A takes 15 s while B takes 20 s to
accomplish the task.
What is the work done by each?
The work done is the same. However,
A has taken less time than B to do
the work.
Who has done more work in a given
time, say in 1 s?

Example 11.8 A boy of mass 50 kg runs
up a staircase of 45 steps in 9 s. If the
height of each step is 15 cm, find his
power. Take g = 10 m s–2.
Solution:
Weight of the boy,
mg = 50 kg × 10 m s–2 = 500 N
Height of the staircase,
h = 45 × 15/100 m = 6.75 m

Q

uestions

The unit joule is too small and hence is
inconvenient to express large quantities of
energy. We use a bigger unit of energy called
kilowatt hour (kW h).
What is 1 kW h? Let us say we have a
machine that uses 1000 J of energy every
second. If this machine is used continuously
for one hour, it will consume 1 kW h of energy.
Thus, 1 kW h is the energy used in one hour
at the rate of 1000 J s–1 (or 1 kW).
1 kW h = 1 kW ×1 h
= 1000 W × 3600 s
= 3600000 J
1 kW h = 3.6 × 106 J.
The energy used in households, industries
and commercial establishments are usually
expressed in kilowatt hour. For example,
electrical energy used during a month is
expressed in terms of ‘units’. Here, 1 ‘unit’
means 1 kilowatt hour.
Example 11.9 An electric bulb of 60 W is
used for 6 h per day. Calculate the ‘units’
of energy consumed in one day by the
bulb.
Solution:
Power of electric bulb = 60 W
= 0.06 kW.
Time used, t = 6 h
Energy = power × time taken
= 0.06 kW × 6 h
= 0.36 kW h
= 0.36 ‘units’.
The energy consumed by the bulb is
0.36 ‘units’.

learnt
•

Work done on an object is defined as the magnitude of the
force multiplied by the distance moved by the object in the
direction of the applied force. The unit of work is joule:
1 joule = 1 newton × 1 metre.

•

Work done on an object by a force would be zero if the
displacement of the object is zero.

•

An object having capability to do work is said to possess energy.
Energy has the same unit as that of work.

•

An object in motion possesses what is known as the kinetic
energy of the object. An object of mass, m moving with velocity
1
2
v has a kinetic energy of 2 mv .

WORK

AND

•

The energy possessed by a body due to its change in position
or shape is called the potential energy. The gravitational
potential energy of an object of mass, m raised through a height,
h from the earth’s surface is given by m g h.

•

According to the law of conservation of energy, energy can
only be transformed from one form to another; it can neither
be created nor destroyed. The total energy before and after
the transformation always remains constant.

•

Energy exists in nature in several forms such as kinetic
energy, potential energy, heat energy, chemical energy etc.
The sum of the kinetic and potential energies of an object is
called its mechanical energy.

•

Power is defined as the rate of doing work. The SI unit of
power is watt. 1 W = 1 J/s.

•

The energy used in one hour at the rate of 1kW is called 1 kW h.
