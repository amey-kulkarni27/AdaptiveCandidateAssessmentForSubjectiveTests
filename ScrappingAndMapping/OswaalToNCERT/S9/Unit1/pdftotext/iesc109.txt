Chapter 9
FORCE

AND

In the previous chapter, we described the
motion of an object along a straight line in
terms of its position, velocity and acceleration.
We saw that such a motion can be uniform
or non-uniform. We have not yet discovered
what causes the motion. Why does the speed
of an object change with time? Do all motions
require a cause? If so, what is the nature of
this cause? In this chapter we shall make an
attempt to quench all such curiosities.
For many centuries, the problem of
motion and its causes had puzzled scientists
and philosophers. A ball on the ground, when
given a small hit, does not move forever. Such
observations suggest that rest is the “natural
state” of an object. This remained the belief
until Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton
developed an entirely different approach to
understand motion.

LAWS

OF

MOTION

In our everyday life we observe that some
effort is required to put a stationary object
into motion or to stop a moving object. We
ordinarily experience this as a muscular effort
and say that we must push or hit or pull on
an object to change its state of motion. The
concept of force is based on this push, hit or
pull. Let us now ponder about a ‘force’. What
is it? In fact, no one has seen, tasted or felt a
force. However, we always see or feel the effect
of a force. It can only be explained by
describing what happens when a force is
applied to an object. Pushing, hitting and
pulling of objects are all ways of bringing
objects in motion (Fig. 9.1). They move
because we make a force act on them.
From your studies in earlier classes, you
are also familiar with the fact that a force can
be used to change the magnitude of velocity
of an object (that is, to make the object move
faster or slower) or to change its direction of
motion. We also know that a force can change
the shape and size of objects (Fig. 9.2).

Forces

box with a small force, the box does not move
because of friction acting in a direction
opposite to the push [Fig. 9.4(a)]. This friction
force arises between two surfaces in contact;
in this case, between the bottom of the box
and floor’s rough surface. It balances the
pushing force and therefore the box does not
move. In Fig. 9.4(b), the children push the
box harder but the box still does not move.
This is because the friction force still balances
the pushing force. If the children push the
box harder still, the pushing force becomes
bigger than the friction force [Fig. 9.4(c)].
There is an unbalanced force. So the box
starts moving.
What happens when we ride a bicycle?
When we stop pedalling, the bicycle begins
to slow down. This is again because of the
friction forces acting opposite to the direction
of motion. In order to keep the bicycle moving,
we have to start pedalling again. It thus
appears that an object maintains its motion
under the continuous application of an
unbalanced force. However, it is quite
incorrect. An object moves with a uniform
velocity when the forces (pushing force and
frictional force) acting on the object are
balanced and there is no net external force
on it. If an unbalanced force is applied on
the object, there will be a change either in its
speed or in the direction of its motion. Thus,
to accelerate the motion of an object, an
unbalanced force is required. And the change
in its speed (or in the direction of motion)
would continue as long as this unbalanced
force is applied. However, if this force is

Fig. 9.3 shows a wooden block on a horizontal
table. Two strings X and Y are tied to the two
opposite faces of the block as shown. If we
apply a force by pulling the string X, the block
begins to move to the right. Similarly, if we
pull the string Y, the block moves to the left.
But, if the block is pulled from both the sides
with equal forces, the block will not move.
Such forces are called balanced forces and
do not change the state of rest or of motion of
an object. Now, let us consider a situation in
which two opposite forces of different
magnitudes pull the block. In this case, the
block would begin to move in the direction of
the greater force. Thus, the two forces are
not balanced and the unbalanced force acts
in the direction the block moves. This
suggests that an unbalanced force acting on
an object brings it in motion.

removed completely, the object would
continue to move with the velocity it has
acquired till then.

9.2 First Law of Motion
By observing the motion of objects on an
inclined plane Galileo deduced that objects
move with a constant speed when no force
acts on them. He observed that when a marble
rolls down an inclined plane, its velocity
increases [Fig. 9.5(a)]. In the next chapter,
you will learn that the marble falls under the
unbalanced force of gravity as it rolls down
and attains a definite velocity by the time it
reaches the bottom. Its velocity decreases
when it climbs up as shown in Fig. 9.5(b).
Fig. 9.5(c) shows a marble resting on an ideal
frictionless plane inclined on both sides.
Galileo argued that when the marble is
released from left, it would roll down the slope
and go up on the opposite side to the same
height from which it was released. If the
inclinations of the planes on both sides are
equal then the marble will climb the same
distance that it covered while rolling down. If
the angle of inclination of the right-side plane
were gradually decreased, then the marble
would travel further distances till it reaches
the original height. If the right-side plane were
ultimately made horizontal (that is, the slope
is reduced to zero), the marble would continue
to travel forever trying to reach the same
height that it was released from. The
unbalanced forces on the marble in this case
are zero. It thus suggests that an unbalanced
(external) force is required to change the
motion of the marble but no net force is
needed to sustain the uniform motion of the
marble. In practical situations it is difficult
to achieve a zero unbalanced force. This is
because of the presence of the frictional force
acting opposite to the direction of motion.
Thus, in practice the marble stops after
travelling some distance. The effect of the
frictional force may be minimised by using a
smooth marble and a smooth plane and
providing a lubricant on top of the planes.

Fig. 9.5: (a) the downward motion; (b) the upward
motion of a marble on an inclined plane;
and (c) on a double inclined plane.

Newton further studied Galileo’s ideas on
force and motion and presented three
fundamental laws that govern the motion of
objects. These three laws are known as
Newton’s laws of motion. The first law of
motion is stated as:
An object remains in a state of rest or of
uniform motion in a straight line unless
compelled to change that state by an applied
force.
In other words, all objects resist a change
in their state of motion. In a qualitative way,
the tendency of undisturbed objects to stay
at rest or to keep moving with the same
velocity is called inertia. This is why, the first
law of motion is also known as the law of
inertia.
Certain experiences that we come across
while travelling in a motorcar can be
explained on the basis of the law of inertia.
We tend to remain at rest with respect to the
seat until the driver applies a braking force
to stop the motorcar. With the application of
brakes, the car slows down but our body
tends to continue in the same state of motion
because of its inertia. A sudden application
of brakes may thus cause injury to us by

Galileo Galilei was born
on 15 February 1564 in
Pisa, Italy. Galileo, right
from his childhood, had
interest in mathematics
and natural philosophy.
But
his
father
Vincenzo Galilei wanted
him to become a medical
doctor.
Accordingly,
Galileo Galilei
Galileo enrolled himself
(1564 – 1642)
for a medical degree at the
University of Pisa in 1581 which he never
completed because of his real interest in
mathematics. In 1586, he wrote his first
scientific book ‘The Little Balance [La
Balancitta]’, in which he described
Archimedes’ method of finding the relative
densities (or specific gravities) of substances
using a balance. In 1589, in his series of
essays – De Motu, he presented his theories
about falling objects using an inclined plane
to slow down the rate of descent.
In 1592, he was appointed professor of
mathematics at the University of Padua in
the Republic of Venice. Here he continued his
observations on the theory of motion and
through his study of inclined planes and the
pendulum, formulated the correct law for
uniformly accelerated objects that the
distance the object moves is proportional to
the square of the time taken.
Galileo was also a remarkable craftsman.
He developed a series of telescopes whose
optical performance was much better than
that of other telescopes available during those
days. Around 1640, he designed the first
pendulum clock. In his book ‘Starry
Messenger’ on his astronomical discoveries,
Galileo claimed to have seen mountains on
the moon, the milky way made up of tiny
stars, and four small bodies orbiting Jupiter.
In his books ‘Discourse on Floating Bodies’
and ‘Letters on the Sunspots’, he disclosed
his observations of sunspots.
Using his own telescopes and through his
observations on Saturn and Venus, Galileo
argued that all the planets must orbit the Sun
and not the earth, contrary to what was
believed at that time.

impact or collision with the panels in front.
Safety belts are worn to prevent such
accidents. Safety belts exert a force on our
body to make the forward motion slower. An
opposite experience is encountered when we
are standing in a bus and the bus begins to
move suddenly. Now we tend to fall
backwards. This is because the sudden start
of the bus brings motion to the bus as well
as to our feet in contact with the floor of the
bus. But the rest of our body opposes this
motion because of its inertia.
When a motorcar makes a sharp turn at
a high speed, we tend to get thrown to one
side. This can again be explained on the basis
of the law of inertia. We tend to continue in
our straight-line motion. When an
unbalanced force is applied by the engine to
change the direction of motion of the
motorcar, we slip to one side of the seat due
to the inertia of our body.
The fact that a body will remain at rest
unless acted upon by an unbalanced force
can be illustrated through the following
activities:

a table, as shown in Fig. 9.6.
Attempt a sharp horizontal hit at the

coin or the striker. If the hit is strong
enough, the bottom coin moves out
quickly. Once the lowest coin is
removed, the inertia of the other coins
makes them ‘fall’ vertically on the table.

find that a lesser force is required to perform
the activity. A force that is just enough to
cause a small cart to pick up a large velocity
will produce a negligible change in the motion
of a train. This is because, in comparison to
the cart the train has a much lesser tendency
to change its state of motion. Accordingly, we
say that the train has more inertia than the
cart. Clearly, heavier or more massive objects
offer larger inertia. Quantitatively, the inertia
of an object is measured by its mass. We may
thus relate inertia and mass as follows:
Inertia is the natural tendency of an object to
resist a change in its state of motion or of
rest. The mass of an object is a measure of
its inertia.

the cup from toppling over in case of sudden

9.3 Inertia and Mass
All the examples and activities given so far
illustrate that there is a resistance offered by
an object to change its state of motion. If it is
at rest it tends to remain at rest; if it is moving
it tends to keep moving. This property of an
object is called its inertia. Do all bodies have
the same inertia? We know that it is easier to
push an empty box than a box full of books.
Similarly, if we kick a football it flies away.
But if we kick a stone of the same size with
equal force, it hardly moves. We may, in fact,
get an injury in our foot while doing so!

9.4 Second Law of Motion
The first law of motion indicates that when
an unbalanced external force acts on an

118

SCIENCE

2021-22

object, its velocity changes, that is, the object
gets an acceleration. We would now like to
study how the acceleration of an object
depends on the force applied to it and how
we measure a force. Let us recount some
observations from our everyday life. During
the game of table tennis if the ball hits a player
it does not hurt him. On the other hand, when
a fast moving cricket ball hits a spectator, it
may hurt him. A truck at rest does not require
any attention when parked along a roadside.
But a moving truck, even at speeds as low as
5 m s–1, may kill a person standing in its path.
A small mass, such as a bullet may kill a
person when fired from a gun. These
observations suggest that the impact
produced by the objects depends on their
mass and velocity. Similarly, if an object is to
be accelerated, we know that a greater force
is required to give a greater velocity. In other
words, there appears to exist some quantity
of importance that combines the object’s
mass and its velocity. One such property
called momentum was introduced by Newton.
The momentum, p of an object is defined as
the product of its mass, m and velocity, v.
That is,
p = mv
(9.1)
Momentum has both direction and
magnitude. Its direction is the same as that
of velocity, v. The SI unit of momentum is
kilogram-metre per second (kg m s-1). Since
the application of an unbalanced force brings
a change in the velocity of the object, it is
therefore clear that a force also produces a
change of momentum.
Let us consider a situation in which a car
with a dead battery is to be pushed along a
straight road to give it a speed of 1 m s-1,
which is sufficient to start its engine. If one
or two persons give a sudden push
(unbalanced force) to it, it hardly starts. But
a continuous push over some time results in
a gradual acceleration of the car to this speed.
It means that the change of momentum of
the car is not only determined by the
magnitude of the force but also by the time
during which the force is exerted. It may then
also be concluded that the force necessary to

change the momentum of an object depends
on the time rate at which the momentum is
changed.
The second law of motion states that the
rate of change of momentum of an object is
proportional to the applied unbalanced force
in the direction of force.

9.4.1 MATHEMATICAL

FORMULATION OF

SECOND LAW OF MOTION

Suppose an object of mass, m is moving along
a straight line with an initial velocity, u. It is
uniformly accelerated to velocity, v in time, t
by the application of a constant force, F
throughout the time, t. The initial and final
momentum of the object will be, p1 = mu and
p2 = mv respectively.
The change in momentum

∝ p2 – p1
∝ mv – mu
∝ m × (v – u).

The rate of change of momentum ∝

m × (v − u )
t

Or, the applied force,
F∝

m × (v − u )
t

km × (v − u )
t
= kma

F=

(9.2)
(9.3)

Here a [ = (v – u)/t ] is the acceleration,
which is the rate of change of velocity. The
quantity, k is a constant of proportionality.
The SI units of mass and acceleration are kg
and m s-2 respectively. The unit of force is so
chosen that the value of the constant, k
becomes one. For this, one unit of force is
defined as the amount that produces an
acceleration of 1 m s-2 in an object of 1 kg
mass. That is,
1 unit of force = k × (1 kg) × (1 m s-2).
Thus, the value of k becomes 1. From Eq. (9.3)
(9.4)

F = ma
-2

The unit of force is kg m s or newton,
which has the symbol N. The second law of
119

MOTION

2021-22

motion gives us a method to measure the
force acting on an object as a product of its
mass and acceleration.
The second law of motion is often seen in
action in our everyday life. Have you noticed
that while catching a fast moving cricket ball,
a fielder in the ground gradually pulls his
hands backwards with the moving ball? In
doing so, the fielder increases the time during
which the high velocity of the moving ball
decreases to zero. Thus, the acceleration of
the ball is decreased and therefore the impact
of catching the fast moving ball (Fig. 9.8) is
also reduced. If the ball is stopped suddenly
then its high velocity decreases to zero in a
very short interval of time. Thus, the rate of
change of momentum of the ball will be large.
Therefore, a large force would have to be
applied for holding the catch that may hurt
the palm of the fielder. In a high jump athletic
event, the athletes are made to fall either on
a cushioned bed or on a sand bed. This is to
increase the time of the athlete’s fall to stop
after making the jump. This decreases the
rate of change of momentum and hence the
force. Try to ponder how a karate player
breaks a slab of ice with a single blow.

The first law of motion can be
mathematically stated from the mathematical
expression for the second law of motion. Eq.
(9.4) is
F = ma

or
or

F=

m (v − u )

(9.5)

t

Ft = mv – mu

That is, when F = 0, v = u for whatever time,
t is taken. This means that the object will
continue moving with uniform velocity, u
throughout the time, t. If u is zero then v will
also be zero. That is, the object will remain
at rest.
Example 9.1 A constant force acts on an
object of mass 5 kg for a duration of
2 s. It increases the object’s velocity
from 3 m s–1 to 7 m s -1. Find the
magnitude of the applied force. Now, if
the force was applied for a duration of
5 s, what would be the final velocity of
the object?
Solution:
We have been given that u = 3 m s–1
and v = 7 m s-1, t = 2 s and m = 5 kg.
From Eq. (9.5) we have,
F =

m (v − u )
t

Substitution of values in this relation
gives
F = 5 kg (7 m s-1 – 3 m s-1)/2 s = 10 N.
Now, if this force is applied for a
duration of 5 s (t = 5 s), then the final
velocity can be calculated by rewriting
Eq. (9.5) as
v=u+

Ft
m

On substituting the values of u, F, m
and t, we get the final velocity,
v = 13 m s-1.

moving ball while holding a catch.

Example 9.2 Which would require a
greater force –– accelerating a 2 kg mass
at 5 m s–2 or a 4 kg mass at 2 m s-2 ?
Solution:
From Eq. (9.4), we have F = ma.
Here we have m1 = 2 kg; a1 = 5 m s-2
and m2 = 4 kg; a2 = 2 m s-2.
Thus, F1 = m1a1 = 2 kg × 5 m s-2 = 10 N;
and F2 = m2a2 = 4 kg × 2 m s-2 = 8 N.
⇒ F1 > F2.
Thus, accelerating a 2 kg mass at
5 m s-2 would require a greater force.
Example 9.3 A motorcar is moving with a
velocity of 108 km/h and it takes 4 s to
stop after the brakes are applied.
Calculate the force exerted by the
brakes on the motorcar if its mass along
with the passengers is 1000 kg.

Solution:
From Eq. (9.4) we have m1 = F/a1; and
m2 = F/a2. Here, a1 = 10 m s-2;
a2 = 20 m s-2 and F = 5 N.
Thus, m1 = 5 N/10 m s-2 = 0.50 kg; and
m2 = 5 N/20 m s-2 = 0.25 kg.
If the two masses were tied together,
the total mass, m would be
m = 0.50 kg + 0.25 kg = 0.75 kg.
The acceleration, a produced in the
combined mass by the 5 N force would
be, a = F/m = 5 N/0.75 kg = 6.67 m s-2.
Example 9.5 The velocity-time graph of a
ball of mass 20 g moving along a
straight line on a long table is given in
Fig. 9.9.

Solution:
The initial velocity of the motorcar
u = 108 km/h
= 108 × 1000 m/(60 × 60 s)
= 30 m s-1
and the final velocity of the motorcar
v = 0 m s-1.
The total mass of the motorcar along
with its passengers = 1000 kg and the
time taken to stop the motorcar, t = 4 s.
From Eq. (9.5) we have the magnitude
of the force (F) applied by the brakes as
m(v – u)/t.
On substituting the values, we get
F = 1000 kg × (0 – 30) m s-1/4 s
= – 7500 kg m s-2 or – 7500 N.
The negative sign tells us that the force
exerted by the brakes is opposite to the
direction of motion of the motorcar.
Example 9.4 A force of 5 N gives a mass
m1, an acceleration of 10 m s–2 and a
mass m2, an acceleration of 20 m s-2.
What acceleration would it give if both
the masses were tied together?

How much force does the table exert
on the ball to bring it to rest?
Solution:
The initial velocity of the ball is 20 cm s-1.
Due to the frictional force exerted by the
table, the velocity of the ball decreases
down to zero in 10 s. Thus, u = 20 cm s–1;
v = 0 cm s-1 and t = 10 s. Since the
velocity-time graph is a straight line, it is
clear that the ball moves with a constant
acceleration. The acceleration a is

= –2 cm s-2 = –0.02 m s-2.

The force exerted on the ball F is,
F = ma = (20/1000) kg × (– 0.02 m s-2)

The negative sign implies that the
frictional force exerted by the table is
opposite to the direction of motion of
the ball.

9.5 Third Law of Motion
The first two laws of motion tell us how an
applied force changes the motion and provide
us with a method of determining the force.
The third law of motion states that when one
object exerts a force on another object, the
second object instantaneously exerts a force
back on the first. These two forces are always
equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.
These forces act on different objects and never
on the same object. In the game of football
sometimes we, while looking at the football
and trying to kick it with a greater force,
collide with a player of the opposite team.
Both feel hurt because each applies a force
to the other. In other words, there is a pair of
forces and not just one force. The two
opposing forces are also known as action and
reaction forces.
Let us consider two spring balances
connected together as shown in Fig. 9.10. The
fixed end of balance B is attached with a rigid
support, like a wall. When a force is applied
through the free end of spring balance A, it is
observed that both the spring balances show
the same readings on their scales. It means
that the force exerted by spring balance A on
balance B is equal but opposite in direction
to the force exerted by the balance B on
balance A. Any of these two forces can be called
as action and the other as reaction. This gives
us an alternative statement of the third law of
motion i.e., to every action there is an equal
and opposite reaction. However, it must be
remembered that the action and reaction
always act on two different objects,
simultaneously.

Fig. 9.10: Action and reaction forces are equal and
opposite.

Suppose you are standing at rest and
intend to start walking on a road. You must
accelerate, and this requires a force in
accordance with the second law of motion.
Which is this force? Is it the muscular effort
you exert on the road? Is it in the direction
we intend to move? No, you push the road
below backwards. The road exerts an equal
and opposite force on your feet to make you
move forward.
It is important to note that even though
the action and reaction forces are always
equal in magnitude, these forces may not
produce accelerations of equal magnitudes.
This is because each force acts on a different
object that may have a different mass.
When a gun is fired, it exerts a forward
force on the bullet. The bullet exerts an equal
and opposite force on the gun. This results in
the recoil of the gun (Fig. 9.11). Since the gun
has a much greater mass than the bullet, the
acceleration of the gun is much less than the
acceleration of the bullet. The third law of
motion can also be illustrated when a sailor
jumps out of a rowing boat. As the sailor
jumps forward, the force on the boat moves it
backwards (Fig. 9.12).

a time t, the ball A exerts a force FAB on ball B
and the ball B exerts a force FBA on ball A.
Suppose vA and vB are the velocities of the
two balls A and B after the collision,
respectively [Fig. 9.14(c)].

Fig. 9.14: Conservation of momentum in collision of
two balls.

From Eq. (9.1), the momenta (plural of
momentum) of ball A before and after the
collision are mAuA and mAvA, respectively. The
rate of change of its momentum (or FAB)
during the collision will be m A

This gives,

Since (mAuA + mBuB) is the total momentum
of the two balls A and B before the collision
and (mAvA + mBvB) is their total momentum
after the collision, from Eq. (9.7) we observe
that the total momentum of the two balls
remains unchanged or conserved provided no
other external force acts.
As a result of this ideal collision
experiment, we say that the sum of momenta
of the two objects before collision is equal to
the sum of momenta after the collision
provided there is no external unbalanced
force acting on them. This is known as the
law of conservation of momentum. This
statement can alternatively be given as the
total momentum of the two objects is
unchanged or conserved by the collision.

Example 9.6 A bullet of mass 20 g is
horizontally fired with a velocity
150 m s-1 from a pistol of mass 2 kg.
What is the recoil velocity of the pistol?
Solution:
We have the mass of bullet,
m1 = 20 g (= 0.02 kg) and the mass of
the pistol, m2 = 2 kg; initial velocities of
the bullet (u 1) and pistol (u 2) = 0,
respectively. The final velocity of the
bullet, v1 = + 150 m s-1. The direction
of bullet is taken from left to right
(positive, by convention, Fig. 9.17). Let
v be the recoil velocity of the pistol.

Total momenta of the pistol and bullet
before the fire, when the gun is at rest
= (2 + 0.02) kg × 0 m s–1
= 0 kg m s–1
Total momenta of the pistol and bullet
after it is fired
= 0.02 kg × (+ 150 m s–1)
+ 2 kg × v m s–1
= (3 + 2v) kg m s–1
According to the law of conservation of
momentum
Total momenta after the fire = Total
momenta before the fire
3 + 2v = 0
⇒ v = − 1.5 m s–1.
Negative sign indicates that the
direction in which the pistol would
recoil is opposite to that of bullet, that
is, right to left.

Example 9.7 A girl of mass 40 kg jumps
with a horizontal velocity of 5 m s-1 onto
a stationary cart with frictionless
wheels. The mass of the cart is 3 kg.
What is her velocity as the cart starts
moving? Assume that there is no
external unbalanced force working in
the horizontal direction.
Solution:
Let v be the velocity of the girl on the
cart as the cart starts moving.
The total momenta of the girl and cart
before the interaction
=
=

40 kg × 5 m s–1 + 3 kg × 0 m s–1
200 kg m s–1.

Total momenta after the interaction
=
=

(40 + 3) kg × v m s–1
43 v kg m s–1.

According to the law of conservation of
momentum, the total momentum is
conserved during the interaction.
That is,
43 v = 200
⇒ v = 200/43 = + 4.65 m s–1.
The girl on cart would move with a
velocity of 4.65 m s–1 in the direction in
which the girl jumped (Fig. 9.18).

If v is the velocity of the two entangled
players after the collision, the total
momentum then
= (m1 + m2) × v
= (60 + 55) kg × v m s–1
= 115 × v kg m s–1.
Equating the momenta of the system
before and after collision, in accordance
with the law of conservation of
momentum, we get
v = – 30/115
= – 0.26 m s–1.
Thus, the two entangled players would
move with velocity 0.26 m s–1 from right
to left, that is, in the direction the
second player was moving before
the collision.

Example 9.8 Two hockey players of
opposite teams, while trying to hit a
hockey ball on the ground collide and
immediately become entangled. One
has a mass of 60 kg and was moving
with a velocity 5.0 m s–1 while the other
has a mass of 55 kg and was moving
faster with a velocity 6.0 m s–1 towards
the first player. In which direction and
with what velocity will they move after
they become entangled? Assume that
the frictional force acting between the
feet of the two players and ground is
negligible.
Solution:

Fig. 9.19: A collision of two hockey players: (a) before collision and (b) after collision.

Let the first player be moving from left
to right. By convention left to right is
taken as the positive direction and thus
right to left is the negative direction (Fig.
9.19). If symbols m and u represent the
mass and initial velocity of the two
players, respectively. Subscripts 1 and
2 in these physical quantities refer to
the two hockey players. Thus,
m1 = 60 kg; u1 = + 5 m s-1; and
m2 = 55 kg; u2 = – 6 m s-1.
The total momentum of the two players
before the collision
= 60 kg × (+ 5 m s-1) +
55 kg × (– 6 m s-1)
= – 30 kg m s-1

CONSERVATION LAWS
All conservation laws such as conservation of momentum, energy, angular momentum,
charge etc. are considered to be fundamental laws in physics. These are based on
observations and experiments. It is important to remember that a conservation law cannot
be proved. It can be verified, or disproved, by experiments. An experiment whose result is
in conformity with the law verifies or substantiates the law; it does not prove the law. On
the other hand, a single experiment whose result goes against the law is enough to disprove
it.
The law of conservation of momentum has been deduced from large number of
observations and experiments. This law was formulated nearly three centuries ago. It is
interesting to note that not a single situation has been realised so far, which contradicts
this law. Several experiences of every-day life can be explained on the basis of the law of
conservation of momentum.

FORCE

AND

LAWS

OF

First law of motion: An object continues to be in a state of rest
or of uniform motion along a straight line unless acted upon
by an unbalanced force.
The natural tendency of objects to resist a change in their state
of rest or of uniform motion is called inertia.
The mass of an object is a measure of its inertia. Its SI unit is
kilogram (kg).
Force of friction always opposes motion of objects.
Second law of motion: The rate of change of momentum of an
object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in the
direction of the force.
The SI unit of force is kg m s–2. This is also known as newton
and represented by the symbol N. A force of one newton
produces an acceleration of 1 m s–2 on an object of mass 1 kg.
The momentum of an object is the product of its mass and
velocity and has the same direction as that of the velocity. Its
SI unit is kg m s–1.
Third law of motion: To every action, there is an equal and
opposite reaction and they act on two different bodies.
In an isolated system (where there is no external force), the
total momentum remains conserved.

(c) there is a force on the ball opposing the motion.
(d) there is no unbalanced force on the ball, so the ball would
want to come to rest.

the object pushes back on us with an equal and opposite force.
If the object is a massive truck parked along the roadside, it

that the two opposite and equal forces cancel each other.
Comment on this logic and explain why the truck does not
move.

Akhtar, Kiran and Rahul were riding in a motorcar that was
moving with a high velocity on an expressway when an insect
hit the windshield and got stuck on the windscreen. Akhtar
and Kiran started pondering over the situation. Kiran suggested
that the insect suffered a greater change in momentum as
compared to the change in momentum of the motorcar (because
the change in the velocity of the insect was much more than
that of the motorcar). Akhtar said that since the motorcar was
moving with a larger velocity, it exerted a larger force on the
insect. And as a result the insect died. Rahul while putting an
entirely new explanation said that both the motorcar and the
insect experienced the same force and a change in their
momentum. Comment on these suggestions.
