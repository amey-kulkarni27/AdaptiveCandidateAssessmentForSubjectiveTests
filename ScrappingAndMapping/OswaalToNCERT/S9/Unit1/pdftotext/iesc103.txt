Chapter 3
ATOMS
Ancient Indian and Greek philosophers have
always wondered about the unknown and
unseen form of matter. The idea of divisibility
of matter was considered long back in India,
around 500 BC. An Indian philosopher
Maharishi Kanad, postulated that if we go on
dividing matter (padarth), we shall get smaller
and smaller particles. Ultimately, a stage will
come when we shall come across the smallest
particles beyond which further division will
not be possible. He named these particles
Parm anu. Another Indian philosopher,
Pakudha Katyayama, elaborated this doctrine
and said that these particles normally exist
in a combined form which gives us various
forms of matter.
Around the same era, ancient Greek
philosophers – Democritus and Leucippus
suggested that if we go on dividing matter, a
stage will come when particles obtained
cannot be divided further. Democritus called
these indivisible particles atoms (meaning
indivisible). All this was based on
philosophical considerations and not much
experimental work to validate these ideas
could be done till the eighteenth century.
By the end of the eighteenth century,
scientists recognised the difference between
elements and compounds and naturally
became interested in finding out how and why
elements combine and what happens when
they combine.
Antoine L. Lavoisier laid the foundation
of chemical sciences by establishing two
important laws of chemical combination.

Law of conservation of mass states that
mass can neither be created nor destroyed in
a chemical reaction.

3.1.2 LAW OF CONSTANT PROPORTIONS
Lavoisier, along with other scientists, noted
that many compounds were composed of two
or more elements and each such compound
had the same elements in the same
proportions, irrespective of where the
compound came from or who prepared it.
In a compound such as water, the ratio of
the mass of hydrogen to the mass of oxygen is
always 1:8, whatever the source of water. Thus,
if 9 g of water is decomposed, 1 g of hydrogen
and 8 g of oxygen are always obtained.
Similarly in ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen
are always present in the ratio 14:3 by mass,
whatever the method or the source from which
it is obtained.
This led to the law of constant proportions
which is also known as the law of definite
proportions. This law was stated by Proust as
“In a chemical substance the elements are
always present in definite proportions by
mass”.
The next problem faced by scientists was
to give appropriate explanations of these laws.
British chemist John Dalton provided the
basic theory about the nature of matter.
Dalton picked up the idea of divisibility of
matter, which was till then just a philosophy.
He took the name ‘atoms’ as given by the
Greeks and said that the smallest particles of
matter are atoms. His theory was based on the
laws of chemical combination. Dalton’s atomic
theory provided an explanation for the law of

conservation of mass and the law of definite
proportions.
John Dalton was born in
a poor weaver’s family in
1766 in England. He
began his career as a
teacher at the age of
twelve. Seven years later
he became a school
principal. In 1793, Dalton
left for Manchester to
teach mathematics,
John Dalton
physics and chemistry in
a college. He spent most of his life there
teaching and researching. In 1808, he
presented his atomic theory which was a
turning point in the study of matter.
According to Dalton’s atomic theory, all
matter, whether an element, a compound or
a mixture is composed of small particles called
atoms. The postulates of this theory may be
stated as follows:
(i) All matter is made of very tiny particles
called atoms, which participate in
chemical reactions.
(ii) Atoms are indivisible particles, which
cannot be created or destroyed in a
chemical reaction.
(iii) Atoms of a given element are identical
in mass and chemical properties.
(iv) Atoms of different elements have
dif ferent masses and chemical
properties.
(v) Atoms combine in the ratio of small
whole numbers to form compounds.
(vi) The relative number and kinds of
atoms are constant in a given
compound.
You will study in the next chapter that all
atoms are made up of still smaller particles.

We might think that if atoms are so
insignificant in size, why should we care about
them? This is because our entire world is
made up of atoms. We may not be able to see
them, but they are there, and constantly
affecting whatever we do. Through modern
techniques, we can now produce magnified
images of surfaces of elements showing atoms.

walls, from these walls a room and then a

What about the building block of an ant-hill?
It is a small grain of sand. Similarly, the
building blocks of all matter are atoms.
How big are atoms?
Atoms are very small, they are smaller than
anything that we can imagine or compare
with. More than millions of atoms when
stacked would make a layer barely as thick
as this sheet of paper.

SYMBOLS OF ATOMS OF DIFFERENT
ELEMENTS ?

Dalton was the first scientist to use the
symbols for elements in a very specific sense.
When he used a symbol for an element he
also meant a definite quantity of that element,
that is, one atom of that element. Berzilius
suggested that the symbols of elements be
made from one or two letters of the name of
the element.

In the beginning, the names of elements
were derived from the name of the place where
they were found for the first time. For example,
the name copper was taken from Cyprus. Some
names were taken from specific colours. For
example, gold was taken from the English word
meaning yellow. Now-a-days, IUPAC
(International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry) is an international scientific
organisation which approves names of
elements, symbols and units. Many of the
symbols are the first one or two letters of the
element’s name in English. The first letter of a
symbol is always written as a capital letter
(uppercase) and the second letter as a small
letter (lowercase).

symbols).

3.2.2 ATOMIC MASS
The most remarkable concept that Dalton’s
atomic theory proposed was that of the atomic
mass. According to him, each element had a
characteristic atomic mass. The theory could
explain the law of constant proportions so well
that scientists were prompted to measure the
atomic mass of an atom. Since determining the
mass of an individual atom was a relatively
difficult task, relative atomic masses were
determined using the laws of chemical
combinations and the compounds formed.
Let us take the example of a compound,
carbon monoxide (CO) formed by carbon and
oxygen. It was observed experimentally that 3
g of carbon combines with 4 g of oxygen to
form CO. In other words, carbon combines
with 4/3 times its mass of oxygen. Suppose
we define the atomic mass unit (earlier
abbreviated as ‘amu’, but according to the
latest IUPAC recommendations, it is now
written as ‘u’ – unified mass) as equal to the
mass of one carbon atom, then we would

For example
(i) hydrogen, H
(ii) aluminium, Al and not AL
(iii) cobalt, Co and not CO.
Symbols of some elements are formed from
the first letter of the name and a letter,
appearing later in the name. Examples are: (i)
chlorine, Cl, (ii) zinc, Zn etc.
Other symbols have been taken from the
names of elements in Latin, German or Greek.
For example, the symbol of iron is Fe from its
Latin name ferrum, sodium is Na from natrium,
potassium is K from kalium. Therefore, each
element has a name and a unique chemical
symbol.

whole numbers or as near to a whole numbers
as possible. While searching for various
atomic mass units, scientists initially took 1/
16 of the mass of an atom of naturally
occurring oxygen as the unit. This was
considered relevant due to two reasons:
•
oxygen reacted with a large number of
elements and formed compounds.
•
this atomic mass unit gave masses of
most of the elements as whole numbers.
However, in 1961 for a universally
accepted atomic mass unit, carbon-12 isotope
was chosen as the standard reference for
measuring atomic masses. One atomic mass
unit is a mass unit equal to exactly one-twelfth
(1/12th) the mass of one atom of carbon-12.
The relative atomic masses of all elements
have been found with respect to an atom of
carbon-12.
Imagine a fruit seller selling fruits without
any standard weight with him. He takes a
watermelon and says, “this has a mass equal
to 12 units” (12 watermelon units or 12 fruit
mass units). He makes twelve equal pieces of
the watermelon and finds the mass of each fruit
he is selling, relative to the mass of one piece
of the watermelon. Now he sells his fruits by
relative fruit mass unit (fmu), as in Fig. 3.4.

A molecule is in general a group of two or
more atoms that are chemically bonded
together, that is, tightly held together by
attractive forces. A molecule can be defined as
the smallest particle of an element or a
compound that is capable of an independent
existence and shows all the properties of that
substance. Atoms of the same element or of
different elements can join together to form
molecules.

3.3.1 MOLECULES OF ELEMENTS
The molecules of an element are constituted
by the same type of atoms. Molecules of many
elements, such as argon (Ar), helium (He) etc.
are made up of only one atom of that element.
But this is not the case with most of the nonmetals. For example, a molecule of oxygen
consists of two atoms of oxygen and hence it
is known as a diatomic molecule, O2. If 3
atoms of oxygen unite into a molecule, instead
of the usual 2, we get ozone, O3. The number
of atoms constituting a molecule is known as
its atomicity.
Metals and some other elements, such as
carbon, do not have a simple structure but
consist of a very large and indefinite number
of atoms bonded together.
Let us look at the atomicity of some
non-metals.

species are known as ions. Ions may consist
of a single charged atom or a group of atoms
that have a net charge on them. An ion can be
negatively or positively charged. A negatively
charged ion is called an ‘anion’ and the
positively charged ion, a ‘cation’. Take, for
example, sodium chloride (NaCl). Its
constituent particles are positively charged
sodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged

3.4 Writing Chemical Formulae
The chemical formula of a compound is a
symbolic representation of its composition. The
chemical formulae of different compounds can
be written easily. For this exercise, we need to

learn the symbols and combining capacity of
the elements.
The combining power (or capacity) of an
element is known as its valency. Valency can
be used to find out how the atoms of an
element will combine with the atom(s) of
another element to form a chemical compound.
The valency of the atom of an element can be
thought of as hands or arms of that atom.
Human beings have two arms and an
octopus has eight. If one octopus has to catch
hold of a few people in such a manner that all
the eight arms of the octopus and both arms
of all the humans are locked, how many
humans do you think the octopus can hold?
Represent the octopus with O and humans
with H. Can you write a formula for this
combination? Do you get OH4 as the formula?
The subscript 4 indicates the number of
humans held by the octopus.
The valencies of some common ions are
given in Table 3.6. We will learn more about
valency in the next chapter.

The rules that you have to follow while writing
a chemical formula are as follows:
•
the valencies or charges on the ion must
balance.
•
when a compound consists of a metal and
a non-metal, the name or symbol of the
metal is written first. For example: calcium
oxide (CaO), sodium chloride (NaCl), iron
sulphide (FeS), copper oxide (CuO) etc.,
where oxygen, chlorine, sulphur are nonmetals and are written on the right,
whereas calcium, sodium, iron and
copper are metals, and are written on the
left.
•
in compounds formed with polyatomic ions,
the number of ions present in the
compound is indicated by enclosing the
formula of ion in a bracket and writing the
number of ions outside the bracket. For
example, Mg (OH)2. In case the number of
polyatomic ion is one, the bracket is not
required. For example, NaOH.

3.4.1 FORMULAE OF SIMPLE COMPOUNDS
The simplest compounds, which are made up
of two different elements are called binary
compounds. Valencies of some ions are given
in Table 3.6. You can use these to write
formulae for compounds.
While writing the chemical formulae for
compounds, we write the constituent elements
and their valencies as shown below. Then we
must crossover the valencies of the combining
atoms.

3. Formula of carbon tetrachloride

For magnesium chloride, we write the
symbol of cation (Mg2+) first followed by the
symbol of anion (Cl-). Then their charges are
criss-crossed to get the formula.
4.

Formula of magnesium chloride

Formula : MgCl2
Thus, in magnesium chloride, there are
two chloride ions (Cl-) for each magnesium
ion (Mg2+). The positive and negative charges
must balance each other and the overall
structure must be neutral. Note that in the
formula, the charges on the ions are not
indicated.

Note that the for mula of calcium
hydroxide is Ca(OH)2 and not CaOH2. We use
brackets when we have two or more of the
same ions in the formula. Here, the bracket
around OH with a subscript 2 indicates that
there are two hydroxyl (OH) groups joined to
one calcium atom. In other words, there are
two atoms each of oxygen and hydrogen in
calcium hydroxide.

3.5 Molecular Mass and Mole
Concept
3.5.1 MOLECULAR MASS
In section 3.2.2 we discussed the concept of
atomic mass. This concept can be extended
to calculate molecular masses. The molecular
mass of a substance is the sum of the atomic
masses of all the atoms in a molecule of the
substance. It is therefore the relative mass of
a molecule expressed in atomic mass units (u).

and O = 16 u.

3.5.3 MOLE CONCEPT
Take an example of the reaction of hydrogen
and oxygen to form water:
2H2+ O2 → 2H2O.
The above reaction indicates that
(i) two molecules of hydrogen combine
with one molecule of oxygen to form two
molecules of water, or
(ii) 4 u of hydrogen molecules combine with
32 u of oxygen molecules to form 36 u
of water molecules.
We can infer from the above equation that
the quantity of a substance can be
characterised by its mass or the number of
molecules. But, a chemical reaction equation
indicates directly the number of atoms or
molecules taking part in the reaction.
Therefore, it is more convenient to refer to the
quantity of a substance in terms of the number
of its molecules or atoms, rather than their
masses. So, a new unit “mole” was introduced.
The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount
of substance. One mole contains exactly

Fig. 3.5: Relationship between mole, Avogadro number and mass

40

SCIENCE

2021-22

6.02214076 × 1023 elementary entities. This
number is the fixed numerical value of the
Avogadro constant, NA, when expressed in the
unit mol–1 and is called the Avogadro number*.
The amount of substance, symbol n, of a
system is a measure of the number of specified
elementary entities. An elementary entity may
be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron,
any other particle or specified group of
particles. The mole is the amount of substance
of a system that contains 6.02214076 × 1023
specified elementary entities.
1 mole (of anything) = 6.022 × 1023 in number,
as, 1 dozen = 12 nos.
1 gross = 144 nos.
Besides being related to a number, a mole
has one more advantage over a dozen or a
gross. This advantage is that mass of 1 mole
of a particular substance is also fixed.
The mass of 1 mole of a substance is equal
to its relative atomic or molecular mass in
grams. The atomic mass of an element gives
us the mass of one atom of that element in
atomic mass units (u). To get the mass of
1
mole of atom of that element, that is, molar
mass, we have to take the same numerical
value but change the units from ‘u’ to ‘g’. Molar
mass of atoms is also known as gram atomic
mass. For example, atomic mass of
hydrogen=1u. So, gram atomic mass of
hydrogen = 1 g.
1 u hydrogen has only 1 atom of hydrogen
1 g hydrogen has 1 mole atoms, that is,
6.022 × 1023 atoms of hydrogen.
Similarly,
16 u oxygen has only 1 atom of oxygen,
16 g oxygen has 1 mole atoms, that is,
6.022 × 1023 atoms of oxygen.
To find the gram molecular mass or molar
mass of a molecule, we keep the numerical
value the same as the molecular mass, but
simply change units as above from u to g. For
example, as we have already calculated,
molecular mass of water (H2O) is 18 u. From
here we understand that
18 u water has only 1 molecule of water,
18 g water has 1 mole molecules of water, that
is, 6.022 × 1023 molecules of water.
Chemists need the number of atoms and
molecules while carrying out reactions, and

for this they need to relate the mass in grams
to the number. It is done as follows:
1 mole = 6.022 × 1023 number
= Relative mass in grams.
Thus, a mole is the chemist’s counting unit.
The word “mole” was introduced around
1896 by Wilhelm Ostwald who derived the
term from the Latin word moles meaning a
‘heap’ or ‘pile’. A substance may be considered
as a heap of atoms or molecules. The unit
mole was accepted in 1967 to provide a simple
way of reporting a large number– the massive
heap of atoms and molecules in a sample.

During a chemical reaction, the sum of the masses of the
reactants and products remains unchanged. This is known
as the Law of Conservation of Mass.
In a pure chemical compound, elements are always present in
a definite proportion by mass. This is known as the Law of
Definite Proportions.
An atom is the smallest particle of the element that cannot
usually exist independently and retain all its chemical
properties.
A molecule is the smallest particle of an element or a compound
capable of independent existence under ordinary conditions.
It shows all the properties of the substance.
A chemical formula of a compound shows its constituent
elements and the number of atoms of each combining element.
Clusters of atoms that act as an ion are called polyatomic ions.
They carry a fixed charge on them.
The chemical formula of a molecular compound is determined
by the valency of each element.
In ionic compounds, the charge on each ion is used to
determine the chemical formula of the compound.
Scientists use the relative atomic mass scale to compare the
masses of different atoms of elements. Atoms of carbon-12
isotopes are assigned a relative atomic mass of 12 and the
relative masses of all other atoms are obtained by comparison
with the mass of a carbon-12 atom.
The Avogadro constant 6.022 × 1023 is defined as the number
of atoms in exactly 12 g of carbon-12.
The mole is the amount of substance of a system that
contains 6.02214076 × 1023 specified elementary entities.
Mass of 1 mole of a substance is called its molar mass.

Group Activity
Play a game for writing formulae.
Example1 : Make placards with symbols and valencies of the
elements separately. Each student should hold two
placards, one with the symbol in the right hand and
the other with the valency in the left hand. Keeping
the symbols in place, students should criss-cross their
valencies to form the formula of a compound.
Example 2 : A low cost model for writing formulae: Take empty
blister packs of medicines. Cut them in groups,
according to the valency of the element, as shown in
the figure. Now, you can make formulae by fixing
one type of ion into other.
For example:
Na+

SO 4 2-

P0 43-

Formula for sodium sulphate:
2 sodium ions can be fixed on one sulphate ion.
Hence, the formula will be: Na2SO4
