IS MATTER AROUND US PURE?
How do we judge whether milk, ghee, butter,
salt, spices, mineral water or juice that we
buy from the market are pure?

Fig. 2.1: Some consumable items

Have you ever noticed the word ‘pure’
written on the packs of these consumables?
For a common person pure means having no
adulteration. But, for a scientist all these things
are actually mixtures of different substances
and hence not pure. For example, milk is
actually a mixture of water, fat, proteins etc.
When a scientist says that something is pure,
it means that all the constituent particles of
that substance are the same in their chemical
nature. A pure substance consists of a single
type of particles. In other words, a substance
is a pure single form of matter.
As we look around, we can see that most
of the matter around us exist as mixtures of
two or more pure components, for example,
sea water, minerals, soil etc. are all mixtures.

evaporation. However, sodium chloride is itself
a pure substance and cannot be separated by
physical process into its chemical constituents.
Similarly, sugar is a substance which contains
only one kind of pure matter and its
composition is the same throughout.
Soft drink and soil are not single pure
substances. Whatever the source of a
pure substance may be, it will always have
the same characteristic properties.
Therefore, we can say that a mixture
contains more than one pure substance.

2.1.1 TYPES OF MIXTURES
Depending upon the nature of the components
that form a mixture, we can have different
types of mixtures.

B, C and D.
Group A takes a beaker containing
50 mL of water and one spatula full of
copper sulphate powder. Group B takes
50 mL of water and two spatula full of
copper sulphate powder in a beaker.
Groups C and D can take different
amounts of copper sulphate and
potassium permanganate or common
salt (sodium chloride) and mix the given
components to form a mixture.
Report the observations on the
uniformity in colour and texture.
Groups A and B have obtained a

mixtures or solutions. Some other
examples of such mixtures are: (i) salt
dissolved in water and (ii) sugar

following sections.

1. What is meant by a substance?
2. List the points of differences
between homogeneous and
heterogeneous mixtures.

2.2 What is a Solution?
A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two
or more substances. You come across various
types of solutions in your daily life. Lemonade,
soda water etc. are all examples of solutions.
Usually we think of a solution as a liquid that
contains either a solid, liquid or a gas
dissolved in it. But, we can also have solid
solutions (alloys) and gaseous solutions (air).
In a solution there is homogeneity at the
particle level. For example, lemonade tastes the
same throughout. This shows that particles of
sugar or salt are evenly distributed in the
solution.

dissolved in water. Compar e the
colour of the solutions of the two
groups. Though both the groups have
obtained copper sulphate solution but
the intensity of colour of the solutions
is different. This shows that a
homogeneous mixture can have a
variable composition.
Gr oups C and D have obtained
mixtures, which contain physically
distinct parts and have non-uniform
compositions. Such mixtures are called
heterogeneous mixtures. Mixtures of
sodium chloride and iron filings, salt
and sulphur, and oil and water are
examples of heterogeneous mixtures.

Alloys: Alloys are mixtures of two or
more metals or a metal and a non-metal
and cannot be separated into their
components by physical methods. But
still, an alloy is considered as a mixture
because it shows the properties of its
constituents and can have variable
composition. For example, brass is a
mixture of approximately 30% zinc and
70% copper.

IS MATTER AROUND US PURE?

A solution has a solvent and a solute as its
components. The component of the solution
that dissolves the other component in it
(usually the component present in larger
amount) is called the solvent. The component
of the solution that is dissolved in the solvent
(usually present in lesser quantity) is called
the solute.

Examples:
(i) A solution of sugar in water is a solid
in liquid solution. In this solution,
sugar is the solute and water is the
solvent.
(ii) A solution of iodine in alcohol known
as ‘tincture of iodine’, has iodine (solid)
as the solute and alcohol (liquid) as
the solvent.
(iii) Aerated drinks like soda water etc., are
gas in liquid solutions. These contain
carbon dioxide (gas) as solute and
water (liquid) as solvent.
(iv) Air is a mixture of gas in gas. Air is a
homogeneous mixture of a number of
gases. Its two main constituents are:
oxygen (21%) and nitrogen (78%). The
other gases are present in very small
quantities.

Properties of a solution
•
•

•

•

A solution is a homogeneous mixture.
The particles of a solution are smaller
than 1 nm (10-9 metre) in diameter. So,
they cannot be seen by naked eyes.
Because of very small particle size, they
do not scatter a beam of light passing
through the solution. So, the path of
light is not visible in a solution.
The solute particles cannot be
separated from the mixture by the
process of filtration. The solute particles
do not settle down when left undisturbed,
that is, a solution is stable.

2.2.1 CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION
In activity 2.2, we observed that groups A and
B obtained different shades of solutions. So,
we understand that in a solution the relative

proportion of the solute and solvent can be
varied. Depending upon the amount of solute
present in a solution, it can be called a dilute,
concentrated or a saturated solution. Dilute
and concentrated are comparative terms. In
activity 2.2, the solution obtained by group A
is dilute as compared to that obtained by
group B.

Take approximately 50 mL of water
each in two separate beakers.
Add salt in one beaker and sugar or
barium chloride in the second beaker
with continuous stirring.
When no more solute can be dissolved,
heat the contents of the beaker to raise
the temperature by about 5°C.
Start adding the solute again.

Is the amount of salt and sugar or barium
chloride, that can be dissolved in water at a
given temperature, the same?
At any particular temperature, a solution
that has dissolved as much solute as it is
capable of dissolving, is said to be a saturated
solution. In other words, when no more solute
can be dissolved in a solution at a given
temperature, it is called a saturated solution.
The amount of the solute present in the
saturated solution at this temperature is called
its solubility.
If the amount of solute contained in a
solution is less than the saturation level, it is
called an unsaturated solution.
What would happen if you were to take a
saturated solution at a certain temperature
and cool it slowly.
We can infer from the above activity that
different substances in a given solvent have
different solubilities at the same temperature.
The concentration of a solution is the amount
(mass or volume) of solute present in a given
amount (mass or volume) of solution.
There are various ways of expressing the
concentration of a solution, but here we will
learn only three methods.
(i) Mass by mass percentage of a solution

2.2.2 What is a suspension?
Non-homogeneous systems, like those
obtained by group C in activity 2.2, in which
solids are dispersed in liquids, are called
suspensions. A suspension is a heterogeneous
mixture in which the solute particles do not
dissolve but remain suspended throughout
the bulk of the medium. Particles of a
suspension are visible to the naked eye.

Properties of a Suspension
•

•

Suspension is a heterogeneous
mixture.

•

The particles of a suspension can be seen
by the naked eye.
The particles of a suspension scatter a
beam of light passing through it and
make its path visible.
The solute particles settle down when a
suspension is left undisturbed, that is,
a suspension is unstable. They can be
separated from the mixture by the
process of filtration. When the particles
settle down, the suspension breaks and
it does not scatter light any more.

2.2.3 WHAT IS A COLLOIDAL SOLUTION?
The mixture obtained by group D in activity
2.2 is called a colloid or a colloidal solution.
The particles of a colloid are uniformly spread
throughout the solution. Due to the relatively
smaller size of particles, as compared to that of
a suspension, the mixture appears to be
homogeneous. But actually, a colloidal solution
is a heterogeneous mixture, for example, milk.
Because of the small size of colloidal
particles, we cannot see them with naked eyes.
But, these particles can easily scatter a beam
of visible light as observed in activity 2.2. This
scattering of a beam of light is called the
Tyndall effect after the name of the scientist
who discovered this effect.
Tyndall effect can also be observed when a
fine beam of light enters a room through a small
hole. This happens due to the scattering of light
by the particles of dust and smoke in the air.

Fig. 2.3: (a) Solution of copper sulphate does not show
Tyndall effect, (b) mixture of water and milk

17

IS MATTER AROUND US PURE?

2021-22

•

Tyndall effect can be observed when
sunlight passes through the canopy of a dense
forest. In the forest, mist contains tiny droplets
of water, which act as particles of colloid
dispersed in air.

They cannot be separated from the
mixture by the process of filtration. But,
a special technique of separation known
as centrifugation (perform activity 2.5),
can be used to separate the colloidal
particles.

The components of a colloidal solution are
the dispersed phase and the dispersion
medium. The solute-like component or the
dispersed particles in a colloid form the
dispersed phase, and the component in which
the dispersed phase is suspended is known
as the dispersing medium. Colloids are
classified according to the state (solid, liquid
or gas) of the dispersing medium and the
dispersed phase. A few common examples are
given in Table 2.1. From this table you can
see that they are very common everyday life.

Q

Properties of a colloid
•
•

•

•

A colloid is a heterogeneous mixture.
The size of particles of a colloid is too
small to be individually seen by naked
eyes.
Colloids are big enough to scatter a
beam of light passing through it and
make its path visible.
They do not settle down when left
undisturbed, that is, a colloid is quite
stable.

2.3 Separating the Components
of a Mixture
We have learnt that most of the natural
substances are not chemically pure. Different
methods of separation are used to get
individual components from a mixture.
Separation makes it possible to study and
use the individual components of a mixture.
Heterogeneous mixtures can be separated
into their respective constituents by simple
physical methods like handpicking, sieving,
filtration that we use in our day-to-day life.
Sometimes special techniques have to be used
for the separation of the components of a
mixture.

•

What do you think has got evaporated

•

Is there a residue on the watch glass?

•

What is your interpretation? Is ink a
single substance (pure) or is it a
mixture?

We find that ink is a mixture of a dye in
water. Thus, we can separate the volatile
component (solvent) from its non-volatile
solute by the method of evaporation.

2.3.2 HOW

Fill half a beaker with water.
Put a watch glass on the mouth of the
beaker (Fig. 2.5).
Put few drops of ink on the watch glass.
Now start heating the beaker. We do
not want to heat the ink directly. You
will see that evaporation is taking place
from the watch glass.
Continue heating as the evaporation
goes on and stop heating when you do
not see any further change on the
watch glass.
Observe carefully and record your
observations.

For such particles the filtration technique

is that the denser particles are forced to the
bottom and the lighter particles stay at the
top when spun rapidly.

In the extraction of iron from its ore,

2.3.4 HOW CAN WE SEPARATE A MIXTURE
OF SALT AND CAMPHOR?
We have learnt in chapter 1 that camphor
changes directly from solid to gaseous state
on heating. So, to separate such mixtures that
contain a sublimable volatile component from
a non-sublimable impurity, the sublimation
process is used (Fig. 2.7). Some examples of
solids which sublime are ammonium chloride,
naphthalene and anthracene.

approximately 3 cm above the lower
edge [Fig. 2.8 (a)].
Put a small drop of ink (water soluble,
that is, from a sketch pen or fountain
pen) at the centre of the line. Let it dry.
Lower the filter paper into a jar/glass/
beaker/test tube containing water so
that the drop of ink on the paper is just
above the water level, as shown in Fig.
2.8(b) and leave it undisturbed.
Watch carefully, as the water rises up
on the filter paper. Record your
observations.

This process of separation of components
of a mixture is known as chromatography.
Kroma in Greek means colour. This technique
was first used for separation of colours, so
this name was given. Chromatography is the
technique used for separation of those solutes
that dissolve in the same solvent.
With the advancement in technology,
newer techniques of chromatography have
been developed. You will study about

What do you observe on the filter paper

What according to you, can be the

The ink that we use has water as the
solvent and the dye is soluble in it. As the
water rises on the filter paper it takes along
with it the dye particles. Usually, a dye is a
mixture of two or more colours. The coloured
component that is more soluble in water, rises
faster and in this way the colours get
separated.

2.3.7 HOW

CAN WE OBTAIN DIFFERENT

GASES FROM AIR ?

Air is a homogeneous mixture and can be
separated into its components by fractional
distillation. The flow diagram (Fig. 2.11)
shows the steps of the process.

This method is called distillation. It is used
for the separation of components of a mixture
containing two miscible liquids that boil
without decomposition and have sufficient
difference in their boiling points.
To separate a mixture of two or more
miscible liquids for which the difference in
boiling points is less than 25 K, fractional
distillation process is used, for example, for
the separation of different gases from air,
different factions from petroleum products
etc. The apparatus is similar to that for simple
distillation, except that a fractionating
column is fitted in between the distillation
flask and the condenser.
A simple fractionating column is a tube
packed with glass beads. The beads provide
surface for the vapours to cool and condense
repeatedly, as shown in Fig. 2.10.
Fig. 2.11: Flow diagram shows the process of
obtaining gases from air

If we want oxygen gas from air (Fig. 2.12),
we have to separate out all the other gases
present in the air. The air is compressed by
increasing the pressure and is then cooled
by decreasing the temperature to get liquid
air. This liquid air is allowed to warm-up
slowly in a fractional distillation column,
where gases get separated at different heights
depending upon their boiling points.

it. To remove these impurities, the process of
crystallisation is used. Crystallisation is a
process that separates a pure solid in the form
of its crystals from a solution. Crystallisation
technique is better than simple evaporation
technique as –
•
some solids decompose or some, like
sugar, may get charred on heating to
dryness.
•
some impurities may remain dissolved
in the solution even after filtration. On
evaporation these contaminate the
solid.

What do you observe in the china dish?
Do the crystals look alike?
How will you separate the crystals from
the liquid in the china dish?

The crystallisation method is used to
purify solids. For example, the salt we get

2.4 Physical and Chemical
Changes
In the previous chapter, we have learnt about
a few physical properties of matter. The
properties that can be observed and specified
like colour, hardness, rigidity, fluidity,
density, melting point, boiling point etc. are
the physical properites.
The interconversion of states is a physical
change because these changes occur without
a change in composition and no change in
the chemical nature of the substance.
Although ice, water and water vapour all look
different and display different physical
properties, they are chemically the same.
Both water and cooking oil are liquid but
their chemical characteristics are different.

They differ in odour and inflammability. We
know that oil burns in air whereas water
extinguishes fire. It is this chemical property
of oil that makes it different from water.
Burning is a chemical change. During this
process one substance reacts with another
to undergo a change in chemical composition.
Chemical change brings change in the
chemical properties of matter and we get new
substances. A chemical change is also called
a chemical reaction.
During burning of a candle, both physical
and chemical changes take place. Can you
distinguish these?

2.5 What are the Types of Pure
Substances?

2.5.1 ELEMENTS
Robert Boyle was the first scientist to use the
term element in 1661. Antoine Laurent
Lavoisier (1743-94), a French chemist, was
the first to establish an experimentally useful
definition of an element. He defined an
element as a basic form of matter that cannot
be broken down into simpler substances by
chemical reactions.
Elements can be normally divided into
metals, non-metals and metalloids.
Metals usually show some or all of the
following properties:
•
They have a lustre (shine).
•
They have silvery-grey or golden-yellow
colour.
•
They conduct heat and electricity.
•
They are ductile (can be drawn into
wires).
•
They are malleable (can be hammered
into thin sheets).
•
They are sonorous (make a ringing
sound when hit).
Examples of metals are gold, silver, copper,
iron, sodium, potassium etc. Mercury is the
only metal that is liquid at room temperature.
Non-metals usually show some or all of the
following properties:
•
They display a variety of colours.
•
They are poor conductors of heat and
electricity.
•
They are not lustrous, sonorous or
malleable.
Examples of non-metals are hydrogen,
oxygen, iodine, carbon (coal, coke),
bromine, chlorine etc. Some elements have
intermediate properties between those of
metals and non-metals, they are
called metalloids; examples are boron,
silicon, germanium etc.

More to know

On the basis of their chemical composition,
substances can be classified either as
elements or compounds.

• The number of elements known at

•
•
•
•

present are more than 100.
Ninety-two elements are naturally
occurring and the rest are manmade.
Majority of the elements are solid.
Eleven elements are in gaseous
state at room temperature.
Two elements are liquid at room
temperature–mercury
and
bromine.
Elements, gallium and cesium
become liquid at a temperature
slightly above room temperature
(303 K).

2.5.2 COMPOUNDS
A compound is a substance composed of two
or more elements, chemically combined with
one another in a fixed proportion.

Table 2.2: Mixtures and Compounds
Mixtures

Compounds

1. Elements or compounds just mix
together to form a mixture and no
new compound is formed.

1.

Elements react to form new compounds.

2. A mixture has a variable composition.

2.

The composition of each new substance
is always fixed.

3, A mixture shows the properties of the
constituent substances.

3.

The new substance has totally different
properties.

4. The constituents can be seperated
fairly easily by physical methods.

4.

The constituents can be separated only
by chemical or electrochemical
reactions.

the material obtained.(Note: teacher
supervision is necessary for this
activity).
Perform all the above steps with both
the elements (iron and sulphur)
separately.

Now answer
•

Did the material obtained by the two
groups look the same?

•

Which group has obtained a material
with magnetic properties?

•

Can we separate the components of the
material obtained?

•

On adding dilute sulphuric acid or
dilute hydrochloric acid, did both the
groups obtain a gas? Did the gas in
both the cases smell the same or
different?

The gas obtained by Group I is hydrogen,
it is colourless, odourless and combustible–
it is not advised to do the combustion test for
hydrogen in the class. The gas obtained by
Group II is hydrogen sulphide. It is a colourless
gas with the smell of rotten eggs.

You must have observed that the products
obtained by both the groups show different
properties, though the starting materials were
the same. Group I has carried out the activity
involving a physical change whereas in case
of Group II, a chemical change (a chemical
reaction) has taken place.
•
The material obtained by group I is a
mixture of the two substances. The
substances given are the elements– iron
and sulphur.
•
The properties of the mixture are the
same as that of its constituents.
•
The material obtained by group II is a
compound.
•
On heating the two elements strongly we
get a compound, which has totally
different properties compared to the
combining elements.
•
The composition of a compound is the
same throughout. We can also observe
that the texture and the colour of the
compound are the same throughout.
Thus, we can summarise the physical
and chemical nature of matter in the
following graphical organiser :

A mixture contains more than one substance (element and/
or compound) mixed in any proportion.
Mixtures can be separated into pure substances using
appropriate separation techniques.
A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances.
The major component of a solution is called the solvent, and
the minor, the solute.
The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute present
per unit volume or per unit mass of the solution.
Materials that are insoluble in a solvent and have particles
that are visible to naked eyes, form a suspension. A suspension
is a heterogeneous mixture.
Colloids are heterogeneous mixtures in which the particle size
is too small to be seen with the naked eye, but is big enough to
scatter light. Colloids are useful in industry and daily life. The
particles are called the dispersed phase and the medium in
which they are distributed is called the dispersion medium.
Pure substances can be elements or compounds. An element
is a form of matter that cannot be broken down by chemical
reactions into simpler substances. A compound is a substance
composed of two or more different types of elements, chemically
combined in a fixed proportion.
Properties of a compound are different from its constituent
elements, whereas a mixture shows the properties of its
constituting elements or compounds.
