Chapter 10
GRAVITATION
In Chapters 8 and 9, we have learnt about
the motion of objects and force as the cause
of motion. We have learnt that a force is
needed to change the speed or the direction
of motion of an object. We always observe that
an object dropped from a height falls towards
the earth. We know that all the planets go
around the Sun. The moon goes around the
earth. In all these cases, there must be some
force acting on the objects, the planets and
on the moon. Isaac Newton could grasp that
the same force is responsible for all these.
This force is called the gravitational force.
In this chapter we shall learn about
gravitation and the universal law of
gravitation. We shall discuss the motion of
objects under the influence of gravitational
force on the earth. We shall study how the
weight of a body varies from place to place.
We shall also discuss the conditions for
objects to float in liquids.

Let us try to understand the motion of
the moon by recalling activity 8.11.

Take a piece of thread.
Tie a small stone at one end. Hold the
other end of the thread and whirl it
round, as shown in Fig. 10.1.
Note the motion of the stone.
Release the thread.
Again, note the direction of motion of
the stone.

10.1 Gravitation
We know that the moon goes around the
earth. An object when thrown upwards,
reaches a certain height and then falls
downwards. It is said that when Newton was
sitting under a tree, an apple fell on him. The
fall of the apple made Newton start thinking.
He thought that: if the earth can attract an
apple, can it not attract the moon? Is the force
the same in both cases? He conjectured that
the same type of force is responsible in both
the cases. He argued that at each point of its
orbit, the moon falls towards the earth,
instead of going off in a straight line. So, it
must be attracted by the earth. But we do
not really see the moon falling towards the
earth.

2021-22

Fig. 10.1: A stone describing a circular path with a
velocity of constant magnitude.

Before the thread is released, the stone
moves in a circular path with a certain speed
and changes direction at every point. The
change in direction involves change in velocity
or acceleration. The force that causes this
acceleration and keeps the body moving along
the circular path is acting towards the centre.
This force is called the centripetal (meaning
‘centre-seeking’) force. In the absence of this

force, the stone flies off along a straight line.
This straight line will be a tangent to the
circular path.

More to know

Tangent to a circle

A straight line that meets the circle
at one and only one point is called a
tangent to the circle. Straight line
ABC is a tangent to the circle at
point B.

The motion of the moon around the earth
is due to the centripetal force. The centripetal
force is provided by the force of attraction of
the earth. If there were no such force, the
moon would pursue a uniform straight line
motion.
It is seen that a falling apple is attracted
towards the earth. Does the apple attract the
earth? If so, we do not see the earth moving
towards an apple. Why?
According to the third law of motion, the
apple does attract the earth. But according
to the second law of motion, for a given force,
acceleration is inversely proportional to the
mass of an object [Eq. (9.4)]. The mass of an
apple is negligibly small compared to that of
the earth. So, we do not see the earth moving
towards the apple. Extend the same argument
for why the earth does not move towards the
moon.
In our solar system, all the planets go
around the Sun. By arguing the same way,
we can say that there exists a force between
the Sun and the planets. From the above facts
Newton concluded that not only does the
earth attract an apple and the moon, but all
objects in the universe attract each other. This
force of attraction between objects is called
the gravitational force.

10.1.1 UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION
Every object in the universe attracts every
other object with a force which is proportional
to the product of their masses and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance
between them. The force is along the line
joining the centres of two objects.

F = G

Fig. 10.2: The gravitational force between two
uniform objects is directed along the line
joining their centres.

Let two objects A and B of masses M and
m lie at a distance d from each other as shown
in Fig. 10.2. Let the force of attraction between
two objects be F. According to the universal
law of gravitation, the force between two
objects is directly proportional to the product
of their masses. That is,
(10.1)
F∝M × m
And the force between two objects is inversely
proportional to the square of the distance
between them, that is,
F∝

Isaac Newton was born
in Woolsthorpe near
Grantham, England.
He
is generally
regarded as the most
original
and
influential theorist in
the history of science.
He was born in a poor
farming family. But he
was not good at
farming. He was sent
to study at Cambridge
Isaac Newton
University in 1661. In
(1642 – 1727)
1665 a plague broke
out in Cambridge and so Newton took a year
off. It was during this year that the incident of
the apple falling on him is said to have
occurred. This incident prompted Newton to
explore the possibility of connecting gravity
with the force that kept the moon in its orbit.
This led him to the universal law of
gravitation. It is remarkable that many great
scientists before him knew of gravity but failed
to realise it.
Newton formulated the well-known laws of
motion. He worked on theories of light and
colour. He designed an astronomical telescope
to carry out astronomical observations.
Newton was also a great mathematician. He
invented a new branch of mathematics, called
calculus. He used it to prove that for objects
outside a sphere of uniform density, the sphere
behaves as if the whole of its mass is
concentrated at its centre. Newton
transfor med the structure of physical
science with his three laws of motion and the
universal law of gravitation. As the keystone
of the scientific revolution of the seventeenth
century, Newton’s work combined the
contributions of Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo,
and others into a new powerful synthesis.
It is remarkable that though the
gravitational theory could not be verified at
that time, there was hardly any doubt about
its correctness. This is because Newton based
his theory on sound scientific reasoning and
backed it with mathematics. This made the
theory simple and elegant. These qualities are
now recognised as essential requirements of a
good scientific theory.

How did Newton guess the
inverse-square rule?
There has always been a great interest
in the motion of planets. By the 16th
century, a lot of data on the motion of
planets had been collected by many
astronomers. Based on these data
Johannes Kepler derived three laws,
which govern the motion of planets.
These are called Kepler’s laws. These are:
1. The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with
the Sun at one of the foci, as shown in
the figure given below. In this figure O
is the position of the Sun.
2. The line joining the planet and the Sun
sweep equal areas in equal intervals
of time. Thus, if the time of travel from
A to B is the same as that from C to D,
then the areas OAB and OCD are
equal.
3. The cube of the mean distance of a
planet from the Sun is proportional to
the square of its orbital period T. Or,
r3/T2 = constant.
It is important to note that Kepler
could not give a theory to explain
the motion of planets. It was Newton
who showed that the cause of the
planetary motion is the gravitational
force that the Sun exerts on them. Newton
used the third law
C
D
of Kepler to
calculate
the
gravitational force
B
O
of attraction. The
A
gravitational force
of the earth is
weakened by distance. A simple argument
goes like this. We can assume that the
planetary orbits are circular. Suppose the
orbital velocity is v and the radius of the
orbit is r. Then the force acting on an
orbiting planet is given by F ∝ v2/r.
If T denotes the period, then v = 2πr/T,
so that v2 ∝ r2/T2.
We can rewrite this as v2 ∝ (1/r) ×
3
( r /T2). Since r3/T2 is constant by Kepler’s
third law, we have v2 ∝ 1/r. Combining
this with F ∝ v2/ r, we get, F ∝ 1/ r2.

The SI unit of G can be obtained by

Henry Cavendish (1731 – 1810) by using a
sensitive balance. The accepted value of G is
6.673 × 10–11 N m2 kg–2.

it is applicable to all bodies, whether

bigger by a factor of 6, F becomes

Example 10.1 The mass of the earth is
6 × 1024 kg and that of the moon is
7.4 × 1022 kg. If the distance between the
earth and the moon is 3.84×105 km,
calculate the force exerted by the earth on
the moon. (Take G = 6.7 × 10–11 N m2 kg-2)
Solution:
The mass of the earth, M = 6 × 1024 kg
The mass of the moon,
m = 7.4 × 1022 kg
The distance between the earth and the
moon,
d = 3.84 × 105 km

Thus, the force exerted by the earth on

The universal law of gravitation successfully
explained several phenomena which were
believed to be unconnected:
(i) the force that binds us to the earth;

We have learnt that the earth attracts

gravitational force. Whenever objects fall
towards the earth under this force alone, we
say that the objects are in free fall. Is there any

SCIENCE

change in the velocity of falling objects? While
falling, there is no change in the direction of
motion of the objects. But due to the earth’s
attraction, there will be a change in the
magnitude of the velocity. Any change in
velocity involves acceleration. Whenever an
object falls towards the earth, an acceleration
is involved. This acceleration is due to the
earth’s gravitational force. Therefore, this
acceleration is called the acceleration due to
the gravitational force of the earth (or
acceleration due to gravity). It is denoted by
g. The unit of g is the same as that of
acceleration, that is, m s–2.
We know from the second law of motion
that force is the product of mass and
acceleration. Let the mass of the stone in
activity 10.2 be m. We already know that there
is acceleration involved in falling objects due
to the gravitational force and is denoted by g.
Therefore the magnitude of the gravitational
force F will be equal to the product of mass
and acceleration due to the gravitational
force, that is,
F=mg

Take a sheet of paper and a stone. Drop
them simultaneously from the first floor

them reach the ground simultaneously.
We see that paper reaches the ground
little later than the stone. This happens
because of air resistance. The air offers
resistance due to friction to the motion
of the falling objects. The resistance
offered by air to the paper is more than
the resistance offered to the stone. If
we do the experiment in a glass jar from
which air has been sucked out, the
paper and the stone would fall at the
same rate.

We know that an object experiences
acceleration during free fall. From Eq. (10.9),
this acceleration experienced by an object is
independent of its mass. This means that all
objects hollow or solid, big or small, should
fall at the same rate. According to a story,
Galileo dropped different objects from the top
of the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy to prove
the same.
As g is constant near the earth, all the
equations for the uniformly accelerated
motion of objects become valid with
acceleration a replaced by g (see section 8.5).

where u and v are the initial and final
velocities and s is the distance covered in

In applying these equations, we will take
acceleration, a to be positive when it is in the

be taken as negative when it opposes the
motion.

g = 10 m s –2 (for simplifying the
calculations).

10.3 Mass
We have learnt in the previous chapter that the
mass of an object is the measure of its inertia
(section 9.3). We have also learnt that greater
the mass, the greater is the inertia. It remains
the same whether the object is on the earth,
the moon or even in outer space. Thus, the
mass of an object is constant and does not
change from place to place.

10.4 Weight
We know that the earth attracts every object
with a certain force and this force depends on
the mass (m) of the object and the acceleration
due to the gravity (g). The weight of an object
is the force with which it is attracted towards
the earth.
We know that
F = m × a,
(10.13)
that is,
(10.14)
F = m × g.
The force of attraction of the earth on an
object is known as the weight of the object. It
is denoted by W. Substituting the same in Eq.
(10.14), we have
W=m×g
(10.15)
As the weight of an object is the force with
which it is attracted towards the earth, the SI
unit of weight is the same as that of force, that
is, newton (N). The weight is a force acting
vertically downwards; it has both magnitude
and direction.
We have learnt that the value of g is
constant at a given place. Therefore at a given
place, the weight of an object is directly
proportional to the mass, say m, of the object,
that is, W ∝ m. It is due to this reason that at
a given place, we can use the weight of an
object as a measure of its mass. The mass of
an object remains the same everywhere, that
is, on the earth and on any planet whereas its
weight depends on its location because g
depends on location.

attracts the object. In the same way, the weight
of an object on the moon is the force with
which the moon attracts that object. The mass
of the moon is less than that of the earth. Due
to this the moon exerts lesser force of attraction
on objects.
Let the mass of an object be m. Let its
weight on the moon be Wm. Let the mass of
the moon be Mm and its radius be Rm.

bulletin board, as shown in Fig 10.3. To do

with your thumb. You apply a force on the

is directed perpendicular to the surface area
of the board. This force acts on a smaller area
at the tip of the pin.

Have you ever wondered why a camel can run

sharp edges? In order to address these
questions and understand the phenomena
involved, it helps to introduce the concepts

Fig. 10.3: To fix a poster, drawing pins are pressed
with the thumb perpendicular to the board.

Situation 2: You stand on loose sand. Your
feet go deep into the sand. Now, lie down on
the sand. You will find that your body will not
go that deep in the sand. In both cases the
force exerted on the sand is the weight of your
body.

138

SCIENCE

2021-22

You have learnt that weight is the force
acting vertically downwards. Here the force
is acting perpendicular to the surface of the
sand. The force acting on an object
perpendicular to the surface is called thrust.
When you stand on loose sand, the force,
that is, the weight of your body is acting on
an area equal to area of your feet. When you
lie down, the same force acts on an area equal
to the contact area of your whole body, which
is larger than the area of your feet. Thus, the
effects of forces of the same magnitude on
different areas are different. In the above
cases, thrust is the same. But effects are
different. Therefore the effect of thrust
depends on the area on which it acts.
The effect of thrust on sand is larger while
standing than while lying. The thrust on unit
area is called pressure. Thus,
Pressure =

thrust
area

(10.20)

Substituting the SI unit of thrust and area in
Eq. (10.20), we get the SI unit of pressure as
N/m2 or N m–2.
In honour of scientist Blaise Pascal, the
SI unit of pressure is called pascal, denoted
as Pa.
Let us consider a numerical example to
understand the effects of thrust acting on
different areas.
Example 10.6 A block of wood is kept on a
tabletop. The mass of wooden block is 5
kg and its dimensions are 40 cm × 20
cm × 10 cm. Find the pressure exerted

by the wooden block on the table top if
it is made to lie on the table top with its
sides of dimensions (a) 20 cm × 10 cm
and (b) 40 cm × 20 cm.
Solution:
The mass of the wooden block = 5 kg
The dimensions
= 40 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm
Here, the weight of the wooden block
applies a thrust on the table top.
That is,
Thrust = F = m × g
= 5 kg × 9.8 m s–2
= 49 N
Area of a side = length × breadth
= 20 cm × 10 cm
= 200 cm2 = 0.02 m2
From Eq. (10.20),
49 N

Pressure =

0.02 m 2

= 2450 N m-2.

When the block lies on its side of
dimensions 40 cm × 20 cm, it exerts
the same thrust.
Area= length × breadth
= 40 cm × 20 cm
= 800 cm2 = 0.08 m2
From Eq. (10.20),
49 N

Pressure =

0.08 m 2

= 612.5 N m–2

The pressure exerted by the side 20 cm
× 10 cm is 2450 N m–2 and by the side
40 cm × 20 cm is 612.5 N m–2.
Thus, the same force acting on a smaller
area exerts a larger pressure, and a smaller
pressure on a larger area. This is the reason
why a nail has a pointed tip, knives have sharp
edges and buildings have wide foundations.

10.5.1 PRESSURE IN

FLUIDS

All liquids and gases are fluids. A solid exerts
pressure on a surface due to its weight.
Similarly, fluids have weight, and they also

exert pressure on the base and walls of the
container in which they are enclosed. Pressure
exerted in any confined mass of fluid is
transmitted undiminished in all directions.

10.5.2 BUOYANCY
Have you ever had a swim in a pool and felt
lighter? Have you ever drawn water from a
well and felt that the bucket of water is heavier
when it is out of the water? Have you ever
wondered why a ship made of iron and steel
does not sink in sea water, but while the same
amount of iron and steel in the form of a sheet
would sink? These questions can be answered
by taking buoyancy in consideration. Let us
understand the meaning of buoyancy by
doing an activity.

Take an empty plastic bottle. Close the
mouth of the bottle with an airtight
stopper. Put it in a bucket filled with
water. You see that the bottle floats.
Push the bottle into the water. You feel
an upward push. Try to push it further
down. You will find it difficult to push
deeper and deeper. This indicates that
water exerts a force on the bottle in the
upward direction. The upward force
exerted by the water goes on increasing
as the bottle is pushed deeper till it is
completely immersed.
Now, release the bottle. It bounces
back to the surface.
Does the force due to the gravitational
attraction of the earth act on this
bottle? If so, why doesn’t the bottle stay
immersed in water after it is released?
How can you immerse the bottle in
water?

The force due to the gravitational
attraction of the earth acts on the bottle in
the downward direction. So the bottle is
pulled downwards. But the water exerts an
upward force on the bottle. Thus, the bottle is
pushed upwards. We have learnt that weight
of an object is the force due to gravitational
attraction of the earth. When the bottle is
immersed, the upward force exerted by the

water on the bottle is greater than its weight.
Therefore it rises up when released.
To keep the bottle completely immersed,
the upward force on the bottle due to water
must be balanced. This can be achieved by
an externally applied force acting downwards.
This force must at least be equal to the
difference between the upward force and the
weight of the bottle.
The upward force exerted by the water on
the bottle is known as upthrust or buoyant
force. In fact, all objects experience a force of
buoyancy when they are immersed in a fluid.
The magnitude of this buoyant force depends
on the density of the fluid.

10.5.3 WHY OBJECTS FLOAT OR SINK WHEN
PLACED ON THE SURFACE OF WATER?
Let us do the following activities to arrive at
an answer for the above question.

Activity _____________ 10.5

Take a beaker filled with water.
Take an iron nail and place it on the
surface of the water.
Observe what happens.

The nail sinks. The force due to the
gravitational attraction of the earth on the
iron nail pulls it downwards. There is an
upthrust of water on the nail, which pushes
it upwards. But the downward force acting
on the nail is greater than the upthrust of
water on the nail. So it sinks (Fig. 10.5).

placed on the surface of water.

Take a beaker filled with water.
Take a piece of cork and an iron nail of
equal mass.
Place them on the surface of water.
Observe what happens.

The cork floats while the nail sinks. This
happens because of the difference in their
densities. The density of a substance is
defined as the mass per unit volume. The
density of cork is less than the density of
water. This means that the upthrust of water
on the cork is greater than the weight of the
cork. So it floats (Fig. 10.5).
The density of an iron nail is more than
the density of water. This means that the
upthrust of water on the iron nail is less than
the weight of the nail. So it sinks.
Therefore objects of density less than that
of a liquid float on the liquid. The objects of
density greater than that of a liquid sink in
the liquid.

Take a piece of stone and tie it to one

balance.
Suspend the stone by holding the
balance or the string as shown in
Fig. 10.6 (a).

the reading on the spring balance due
to the weight of the stone.

Fig. 10.6: (a) Observe the elongation of the rubber
string due to the weight of a piece of stone

•

Observe what happens to elongation
of the string or the reading on the
balance.

You will find that the elongation of the string
or the reading of the balance decreases as the
stone is gradually lowered in the water.
However, no further change is observed once
the stone gets fully immersed in the water.
What do you infer from the decrease in the
extension of the string or the reading of the
spring balance?
We know that the elongation produced in
the string or the spring balance is due to the
weight of the stone. Since the extension
decreases once the stone is lowered in water,
it means that some force acts on the stone in
upward direction. As a result, the net force
on the string decreases and hence the
elongation also decreases. As discussed
earlier, this upward force exerted by water is
known as the force of buoyancy.
What is the magnitude of the buoyant
force experienced by a body? Is it the same
in all fluids for a given body? Do all bodies
in a given fluid experience the same buoyant
force? The answer to these questions is

contained in Archimedes’ principle, stated as
follows:
When a body is immersed fully or partially
in a fluid, it experiences an upward force that
is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced
by it.
Now, can you explain why a further
decrease in the elongation of the string was
not observed in activity 10.7, as the stone was
fully immersed in water?
Archimedes was a Greek
scientist. He discovered the
principle, subsequently
named after him, after
noticing that the water in a
bathtub overflowed when he
stepped into it. He ran
through the streets shouting
Archimedes
“Eureka!”, which means “I
have got it”. This knowledge helped him to
determine the purity of the gold in the crown
made for the king.

10.7 Relative Density
As you know, the density of a substance is
defined as mass of a unit volume. The unit of
density is kilogram per metre cube (kg m–3).
The density of a given substance, under
specified conditions, remains the same.
Therefore the density of a substance is one
of its characteristic properties. It is different
for different substances. For example, the
density of gold is 19300 kg m-3 while that of
water is 1000 kg m-3. The density of a given
sample of a substance can help us to
determine its purity.
It is often convenient to express density
of a substance in comparison with that of
water. The relative density of a substance is
the ratio of its density to that of water:
Relative density =

Density of a substance
Density of water

Mechanics made him famous. His
understanding of levers, pulleys, wheelsand-axle helped the Greek army in its war
with Roman army.

Since the relative density is a ratio of
similar quantities, it has no unit.

Archimedes’ principle has many
applications. It is used in designing ships and
submarines. Lactometers, which are used to
determine the purity of a sample of milk and
hydrometers used for determining density of
liquids, are based on this principle.

The law of gravitation states that the force of attraction between
any two objects is proportional to the product of their masses
and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between
them. The law applies to objects anywhere in the universe.
Such a law is said to be universal.
Gravitation is a weak force unless large masses are involved.
The force of gravity decreases with altitude. It also varies
on the surface of the earth, decreasing from poles to the
equator.
The weight of a body is the force with which the earth
attracts it.
The weight is equal to the product of mass and acceleration
due to gravity.
The weight may vary from place to place but the mass stays
constant.
All objects experience a force of buoyancy when they are
immersed in a fluid.
Objects having density less than that of the liquid in which
they are immersed, float on the surface of the liquid. If the
density of the object is more than the density of the liquid in
which it is immersed then it sinks in the liquid.
