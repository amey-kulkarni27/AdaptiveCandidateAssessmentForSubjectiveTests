MATTER

IN

OUR SURROUNDINGS

As we look at our surroundings, we see a large
variety of things with different shapes, sizes
and textures. Everything in this universe is
made up of material which scientists have
named “matter”. The air we breathe, the food
we eat, stones, clouds, stars, plants and
animals, even a small drop of water or a
particle of sand – every thing is matter. We
can also see as we look around that all the
things mentioned above occupy space and
have mass. In other words, they have both
mass* and volume**.
Since early times, human beings have
been trying to understand their surroundings.
Early Indian philosophers classified matter in
the form of five basic elements – the
“Panch Tatva”– air, earth, fire, sky and water.
According to them everything, living or nonliving, was made up of these five basic
elements. Ancient Greek philosophers had
arrived at a similar classification of matter.
Modern day scientists have evolved two
types of classification of matter based on their
physical properties and chemical nature.
In this chapter we shall learn about
matter based on its physical properties.
Chemical aspects of matter will be taken up
in subsequent chapters.

1.1 Physical Nature of Matter
1.1.1 MATTER IS MADE UP OF PARTICLES
For a long time, two schools of thought prevailed
regarding the nature of matter. One school
believed matter to be continuous like a block
of wood, whereas, the other thought that matter
was made up of particles like sand. Let us
perform an activity to decide about the nature
of matter – is it continuous or particulate?

Take a 100 mL beaker.
Fill half the beaker with water and
mark the level of water.
Dissolve some salt/ sugar with the help
of a glass rod.
Observe any change in water level.
What do you think has happened to
the salt?
Where does it disappear?
Does the level of water change?

In order to answer these questions we
need to use the idea that matter is made up
of particles. What was there in the spoon, salt
or sugar, has now spread throughout water.
This is illustrated in Fig. 1.1.

Fig. 1.1: When we dissolve salt in water, the particles
of salt get into the spaces between particles
of water.

matter. With every dilution, though the colour
becomes light, it is still visible.

•

This experiment shows that just a few
crystals of potassium permanganate can
colour a large volume of water (about
1000 L). So we conclude that there must be
millions of tiny particles in just one crystal
of potassium permanganate, which keep on
dividing themselves into smaller and smaller
particles.
The same activity can be done using
2 mL of Dettol instead of potassium
permanganate. The smell can be detected
even on repeated dilution.
The particles of matter are very small –
they are small beyond our imagination!!!!

1.2 Characteristics of Particles of
Matter
1.2.1 PARTICLES OF MATTER HAVE SPACE
•

BETWEEN THEM

In activities 1.1 and 1.2 we saw that particles
of sugar, salt, Dettol, or potassium
permanganate got evenly distributed in water.
Similarly, when we make tea, coffee or
lemonade (nimbu paani ), particles of one type
of matter get into the spaces between particles
of the other. This shows that there is enough
space between particles of matter.

Take two glasses/beakers filled with
water.
Put a drop of blue or red ink slowly
and carefully along the sides of the first
beaker and honey in the same way in
the second beaker.
Leave them undisturbed in your house
or in a corner of the class.
Record your observations.
What do you observe immediately after
adding the ink drop?
What do you observe immediately after

potassium permanganate into a glass

solid crystal in the glass?
What happens as time passes?
What does this suggest about the
particles of solid and liquid?
Does the rate of mixing change with
temperature? Why and how?

From the above three activities (1.3, 1.4 and
1.5), we can conclude the following:

SCIENCE

Particles of matter are continuously
moving, that is, they possess what we call
the kinetic energy. As the temperature rises,
particles move faster. So, we can say that with
increase in temperature the kinetic energy of
the particles also increases.
In the above three activities we observe
that particles of matter intermix on their own
with each other. They do so by getting into
the spaces between the particles. This
intermixing of particles of two different types
of matter on their own is called diffusion. We
also observe that on heating, diffusion
becomes faster. Why does this happen?

suggest that particles of matter have force
acting between them. This force keeps the
particles together. The strength of this force of
attraction varies from one kind of matter to
another.

the force is removed. If excessive force is
applied, it breaks.
The shape of each individual sugar or
salt crystal remains fixed, whether we
take it in our hand, put it in a plate or in
a jar.
A sponge has minute holes, in which
air is trapped, when we press it, the air
is expelled out and we are able to
compress it.

Observe different types of matter around you.
What are its different states? We can see that
matter around us exists in three different
states– solid, liquid and gas. These states of
matter arise due to the variation in the
characteristics of the particles of matter.
Now, let us study about the properties of
these three states of matter in detail.

•

1.3.1 THE SOLID STATE

1.3.2 THE LIQUID STATE

Activity _____________ 1.9

Activity _____________ 1.10

Collect the following articles— a pen,
a book, a needle and a piece of wooden
stick.
Sketch the shape of the above articles
in your notebook by moving a pencil
around them.
Do all these have a definite shape,
distinct boundaries and a fixed volume?
What happens if they are hammered,
pulled or dropped?
Are these capable of diffusing into each
other?
Try compressing them by applying
force. Are you able to compress them?

•

•
•
•
•

All the above are examples of solids. We
can observe that all these have a definite
shape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes,
that is, have negligible compressibility. Solids
have a tendency to maintain their shape when
subjected to outside force. Solids may break
under force but it is difficult to change their
shape, so they are rigid.
Consider the following:
(a) What about a rubber band, can it
change its shape on stretching? Is it
a solid?
(b) What about sugar and salt? When
kept in different jars these take the
shape of the jar. Are they solid?
(c) What about a sponge? It is a solid
yet we are able to compress it. Why?
All the above are solids as:
•
A rubber band changes shape under
force and regains the same shape when

•
•

•
•

Collect the following:
(a) water, cooking oil, milk, juice, a
cold drink.
(b) containers of different shapes. Put
a 50 mL mark on these containers
using a measuring cylinder from
the laboratory.
What will happen if these liquids are
spilt on the floor?
Measure 50 mL of any one liquid and
transfer it into different containers one
by one. Does the volume remain the
same?
Does the shape of the liquid remain the
same ?
When you pour the liquid from one
container into another, does it flow
easily?

We observe that liquids have no fixed
shape but have a fixed volume. They take up
the shape of the container in which they are
kept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they
are not rigid but can be called fluid.
Refer to activities 1.4 and 1.5 where we
saw that solids and liquids can diffuse into
liquids. The gases from the atmosphere
diffuse and dissolve in water. These gases,
especially oxygen and carbon dioxide, are
essential for the survival of aquatic animals
and plants.
All living creatures need to breathe for
survival. The aquatic animals can breathe
under water due to the presence of dissolved
oxygen in water. Thus, we may conclude that
solids, liquids and gases can diffuse into
liquids. The rate of diffusion of liquids is

4

SCIENCE

2021-22

higher than that of solids. This is due to the
fact that in the liquid state, particles move
freely and have greater space between each
other as compared to particles in the solid
state.

1.3.3 THE GASEOUS STATE
Have you ever observed a balloon seller filling
a large number of balloons from a single
cylinder of gas? Enquire from him how many
balloons is he able to fill from one cylinder.
Ask him which gas does he have in the cylinder.

Activity _____________ 1.11

Take three 100 mL syringes and close
their nozzles by rubber corks, as
shown in Fig.1.4.
Remove the pistons from all the
syringes.
Leaving one syringe untouched, fill
water in the second and pieces of chalk
in the third.
Insert the pistons back into the
syringes. You may apply some vaseline
on the pistons before inserting them
into the syringes for their smooth
movement.
Now, try to compress the content by
pushing the piston in each syringe.

We have observed that gases are highly
compressible as compared to solids and
liquids. The liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
cylinder that we get in our home for cooking
or the oxygen supplied to hospitals in
cylinders is compressed gas. Compressed
natural gas (CNG) is used as fuel these days
in vehicles. Due to its high compressibility,
large volumes of a gas can be compressed
into a small cylinder and transported easily.
We come to know of what is being cooked
in the kitchen without even entering there,
by the smell that reaches our nostrils. How
does this smell reach us? The particles of the
aroma of food mix with the particles of air
spread from the kitchen, reach us and even
farther away. The smell of hot cooked food
reaches us in seconds; compare this with the
rate of diffusion of solids and liquids. Due to
high speed of particles and large space
between them, gases show the property of
diffusing very fast into other gases.
In the gaseous state, the particles move
about randomly at high speed. Due to this
random movement, the particles hit each
other and also the walls of the container. The
pressure exerted by the gas is because of this
force exerted by gas particles per unit area
on the walls of the container.

On increasing the temperature of solids,
the kinetic energy of the particles increases.
Due to the increase in kinetic energy, the
particles start vibrating with greater speed.
The energy supplied by heat overcomes the
forces of attraction between the particles. The
particles leave their fixed positions and start
moving more freely. A stage is reached when
the solid melts and is converted to a liquid.
The minimum temperature at which a solid
melts to become a liquid at the atmospheric
pressure is called its melting point.
The melting point of a solid is an indication
of the strength of the force of attraction
between its particles.
The melting point of ice is 273.15 K*. The
process of melting, that is, change of solid
state into liquid state is also known as fusion.
When a solid melts, its temperature
remains the same, so where does the heat
energy go?
You must have observed, during the
experiment of melting, that the temperature
of the system does not change after the
melting point is reached, till all the ice melts.
This happens even though we continue to
heat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply
heat. This heat gets used up in changing the

state by overcoming the forces of attraction
between the particles. As this heat energy is
absorbed by ice without showing any rise in
temperature, it is considered that it gets
hidden into the contents of the beaker and is
known as the latent heat. The word latent
means hidden. The amount of heat energy
that is required to change 1 kg of a solid into
liquid at atmospheric pressure at its melting
point is known as the latent heat of fusion.
So, particles in water at 00 C (273 K) have
more energy as compared to particles in ice
at the same temperature.
When we supply heat energy to water,
particles start moving even faster. At a certain
temperature, a point is reached when the
particles have enough energy to break free
from the forces of attraction of each other. At
this temperature the liquid starts changing
into gas. The temperature at which a liquid
starts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is
known as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk
phenomenon. Particles from the bulk of the
liquid gain enough energy to change into the
vapour state.
For water this temperature is 373 K
(100 0C = 273 + 100 = 373 K).
Can you define the latent heat of
vaporisation? Do it in the same way as we
have defined the latent heat of fusion.
Particles in steam, that is, water vapour at
373 K (1000 C) have more energy than water
at the same temperature. This is because
particles in steam have absorbed extra energy
in the form of latent heat of vaporisation.

So, we infer that the state of matter can
be changed into another state by changing
the temperature.
We have learnt that substances around
us change state from solid to liquid and from
liquid to gas on application of heat. But there

*Note: Kelvin is the SI unit of temperature, 00 C =273.15 K. For convenience, we take 00 C = 273 K after
rounding off the decimal. To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale you
have to subtract 273 from the given temperature, and to convert a temperature on the Celsius
scale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature.

closer? Do you think that increasing or
decreasing the pressure can change the state
of matter?

Fig. 1.7: Sublimation of ammonium chloride

•
•

Now, heat slowly and observe.
What do you infer from the above
activity?

A change of state directly from solid to gas
without changing into liquid state is called
sublimation and the direct change of gas to
solid without changing into liquid is called
deposition.

Applying pressure and reducing
temperature can liquefy gases.
Have you heard of solid carbon dioxide
(CO2)? It is stored under high pressure. Solid
CO2 gets converted directly to gaseous state
on decrease of pressure to 1 atmosphere*
without coming into liquid state. This is the
reason that solid carbon dioxide is also known
as dry ice.
Thus, we can say that pressure and
temperature deter mine the state of a
substance, whether it will be solid, liquid or
gas.

1.4.2 EFFECT OF CHANGE OF PRESSURE
We have already learnt that the difference in
various states of matter is due to the
difference in the distances between the
constituent particles. What will happen when
we start putting pressure and compress a gas

3. For any substance, why does the

4. Suggest a method to liquefy

1.5 Evaporation
Do we always need to heat or change pressure
for changing the state of matter? Can you
quote some examples from everyday life where
change of state from liquid to vapour takes
place without the liquid reaching the boiling
point? Water, when left uncovered, slowly
changes into vapour. Wet clothes dry up.
What happens to water in the above two
examples?
We know that particles of matter are
always moving and are never at rest. At a
given temperature in any gas, liquid or solid,
there are particles with different amounts of
kinetic energy. In the case of liquids, a small
fraction of particles at the surface, having
higher kinetic energy, is able to break away
from the forces of attraction of other particles
and gets converted into vapour. This
phenomenon of change of a liquid into
vapours at any temperature below its boiling
point is called evaporation.

1.5.1 FACTORS AFFECTING EVAPORATION
Let us understand this with an activity.

•

•
MATTER

•

You must have observed that the rate of
evaporation increases with–
•
an increase of surface area:
We know that evaporation is a surface
phenomenon. If the surface area is
increased, the rate of evaporation
increases. For example, while putting
clothes for drying up we spread them out.
•
an increase of temperature:
With the increase of temperature, more
number of particles get enough kinetic
energy to go into the vapour state.
•
a decrease in humidity:
Humidity is the amount of water vapour
present in air. The air around us cannot
hold more than a definite amount of
water vapour at a given temperature. If
the amount of water in air is already high,
the rate of evaporation decreases.
•
an increase in wind speed:
It is a common observation that clothes
dry faster on a windy day. With the
increase in wind speed, the particles of
water vapour move away with the wind,
decreasing the amount of water vapour
in the surrounding.
DOES EVAPORATION CAUSE

COOLING?

In an open vessel, the liquid keeps on
evaporating. The particles of liquid absorb
energy from the surrounding to regain the
energy lost during evaporation. This
absorption of energy from the surroundings
make the surroundings cold.

What happens when you pour some
acetone (nail polish remover) on your palm?
The particles gain energy from your palm or
surroundings and evaporate causing the
palm to feel cool.
After a hot sunny day, people sprinkle
water on the roof or open ground because
the large latent heat of vaporisation of water
helps to cool the hot surface.
Can you cite some more examples from
daily life where we can feel the effect of cooling
due to evaporation?
Why should we wear cotton clothes in
summer?
During summer, we perspire more
because of the mechanism of our body which
keeps us cool. We know that during
evaporation, the particles at the surface of
the liquid gain energy from the surroundings
or body surface and change into vapour. The
heat energy equal to the latent heat of
vaporisation is absorbed from the body
leaving the body cool. Cotton, being a good
absorber of water helps in absorbing the
sweat and exposing it to the atmosphere for
easy evaporation.

Why do we see water droplets on the outer
surface of a glass containing ice-cold
water?
Let us take some ice-cold water in a
tumbler. Soon we will see water droplets on
the outer surface of the tumbler. The water
vapour present in air, on coming in contact
with the cold glass of water, loses energy and
gets converted to liquid state, which we see
as water droplets.

Now scientists are talking of five states of matter: Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma and BoseEinstein Condensate.

More to know

Plasma: The state consists of super energetic and super excited particles. These particles
are in the form of ionised gases. The fluorescent tube and neon sign bulbs consist of
plasma. Inside a neon sign bulb there is neon gas and inside a fluorescent tube there
is helium gas or some other gas. The gas gets ionised, that is, gets charged when
electrical energy flows through it. This charging up creates a plasma glowing inside
the tube or bulb. The plasma glows with a special colour depending on the nature of
gas. The Sun and the stars glow because of the presence of plasma in them. The plasma
is created in stars because of very high temperature.
Bose-Einstein Condensate: In 1920, Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose had done
some calculations for a fifth state of matter. Building on his calculations, Albert Einstein
predicted a new state of matter – the Bose-Einstein
Condensate (BEC). In 2001, Eric A. Cornell, Wolfgang
Ketterle and Carl E. Wieman of USA received the Nobel
prize in physics for achieving “Bose-Einstein
condensation”. The BEC is formed by cooling a gas of
extremely low density, about one-hundred-thousandth
the density of normal air, to super low temperatures.

MATTER

IN

•

Matter is made up of small particles.

•

The matter around us exists in three states— solid, liquid
and gas.

•

The forces of attraction between the particles are maximum in
solids, intermediate in liquids and minimum in gases.

•

The spaces in between the constituent particles and kinetic
energy of the particles are minimum in the case of solids,
intermediate in liquids and maximum in gases.

•

The arrangement of particles is most ordered in the case of
solids, in the case of liquids layers of particles can slip and
slide over each other while for gases, there is no order, particles
just move about randomly.

•

The states of matter are inter-convertible. The state of matter
can be changed by changing temperature or pressure.

•

Sublimation is the change of solid state directly to gaseous
state without going through liquid state.

•

Deposition is the change of gaseous state directly to solid
state without going through liquid state.

•

Boiling is a bulk phenomenon. Particles from the bulk
(whole) of the liquid change into vapour state.

•

Evaporation is a surface phenomenon. Particles from the
surface gain enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction
present in the liquid and change into the vapour state.

•

The rate of evaporation depends upon the surface area exposed
to the atmosphere, the temperature, the humidity and the
wind speed.

Group Activity
Prepare a model to demonstrate movement of particles in solids,
liquids and gases.
For making this model you will need
•
A transparent jar
•
A big rubber balloon or piece of stretchable rubber sheet
•
A string
•
Few chick-peas or black gram or dry green peas.
How to make?
•
Put the seeds in the jar.
•
Sew the string to the centre of the rubber sheet and put some
tape to keep it tied securely.
•
Stretch and tie the rubber sheet on the mouth of the jar.
•
Your model is ready. Now run your fingers up and down the
string by first tugging at it slowly and then rapidly.
