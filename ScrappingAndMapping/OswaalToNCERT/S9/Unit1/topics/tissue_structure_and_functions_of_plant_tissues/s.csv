The tissue which is present in the veins of leaves. ," Aerolar,  Ligament,  Cuboidal epithelium,  Sclerenchyma. "
Growth in plant is restricted to certain regions. Give reason for this fact. Mention two growth regions in plants. ,"The growth of plants occurs only in certain specific regions. This is because the dividing tissues, also known as meristematic tissues, are located only at these points. Root tip, Shoot tip, Cambium, base of the leaves   ½ × 4  TISSUES, ORGANS, ORGAN SYSTEM, ORGANISM"
 Name the tissue in the following figure : 3 Marks each," Phloem.  ‘A’–Sieve plate, ‘B’–Sieve tube, ‘C’–Phloem parenchyma, ‘D’–Companion cell."
 Differentiate between epidermal and cork cells.  Why are they called protective tissues ? , Epidermal Cells Permanent tissue Cells possess dividing Cells generally do not ability. divide. Cells are living. Meristematic tissue Cells can be living or dead. Main function is to Performs various type bring about growth. of functions.
 State one point of difference between xylem and phloem.  Draw a neat diagram of xylem vessel and a tracheid. 		  , Xylem conducts water in the plant body. Phloem transports food in the plant body. pits Cork cells Single layered Multi layered Living Non-living Secrete cutin Secrete suberin Present in younger Present in older plants. plants.  They are called protective tissues because  they protect mechanical injury and infection.  they prevent loss of water.  2 + 1

"Give reasons for the following :  Bark of a tree is impervious to gases and water.  In desert plants, epidermis has a thick waxy coating.  Epidermal cells of the roots generally have hair like parts. ", Cells of bark are dead and compactly arranged without intercellular spaces. They have a chemical called suberin in their walls that make them impervious to gases and water.  The thick waxy coating on epidermis is of cutin on its outer surface which is a chemical substance with water-proof quality. This helps in protection against loss of water and parasitic fungi.  Function of epidermal cells in roots is water absorption. Hair like parts greatly increase the total absorptive surface area.

Give reasons for the following :  Cells of sclerenchyma tissue have a narrow lumen.  Branches of a tree move and bend freely in high wind velocity.  It is difficult to pull out the husk of coconut. ," Sclerenchyma tissues have cell wall thickened due to lignin and hence have narrow lumen.  Branches of a tree have collenchymas which provide flexibility.  Husk of coconut is composed of sclerenchyma and these fibres are closely packed.  1 × 3 TISSUES, ORGANS, ORGAN SYSTEM, ORGANISM"
