0,Q. 1. A bridge is 500 m long. A 100 m long train crosses the bridge at a speed of 30 m/s. Find the time taken by train to cross it.,"Ans. From the graph, Velocity after 2s = 10 = 5 m/s Velocity after 4s = 20 = 5 m/s Velocity after 6s = 30 = 5 m/s e.g. Velocity is constant, acceleration = 0 So velocity – time graph will be drawn as : speed = 20 sec."
1,Q. 3. Why is the motion of satellites around their planets considered an accelerated motion ? t ,"Ans. Satellites revolve around their planets in almost circular orbits with constant speed. Thus, during their motion, the speed remains constant, while the direction of motion changes continuously. As a result, there is a change in their velocity. Therefore, the motion of satellites around their planets is considered as accelerated motion."
2,Q. 2.  Define weight of a body. Mention the direction in which it acts.,"Ans.  Weight of an object is the force with which a body is attracted towards the earth. Its direction is vertically downwards.  Final velocity = 0, Initial velocity = 40 ms–1 v2 = u2 + 2gh v – u2 = 2gh h = = 80 m. As the directions are opposite and the stone returns back to origin, displacement is Zero. Total distance covered = 80 + 80 = 160 m. "
3,Q. 3. A cheetah can accelerate from rest at the rate of 4 m/s2.  What will be the velocity attained by it in 10 s?  How far will it travel in this duration ? ,"Ans.  Initial velocity  = 0, acceleration  = 4m/s v = u + at v = 40 m/s.  v2 = u2 + 2as v2 = 2 + 2as v2 = 2as v = 200 m. "
4,Q. 5. A car travelling at a speed of 10 m/s is brought to rest in 20 seconds by applying brakes. Calculate the acceleration and distance travelled during this time. ,"Ans. v = 0; As, a =  Acceleration means slope of graph AB s = 2a a u = 10 m/s t = 20 sec. v–u t = – 0·5 m/s2 s = ut + at2 × – 0·5 × 20 × 20 = 100 m 		  1½ + 1½"
5,Q. 6. Define uniformly accelerated motion and uniform motion. Also write any two equations of uniformly accelerated motion. ,"Ans. When a body travels equal distances in equal intervals of time, its motion is called uniform motion. If an object travels in a straight line and its velocity increases or decreases by equal amounts in equal intervals of time, then the acceleration of the object is said to be uniform and motion is said to be uniformly accelerated motion. Equations : v = u + at and v2 = u2 + 2as 2 + 1 "
6,Q. 7. A bus decreases its speed from 80 km/h to 60 km/h in 5 s. Find the acceleration of the bus. ,"Ans.  100 m as OP = 100 m. 		Time taken  = 5s  Speed of B = Slope of PQ = 150 – 100 = 25 m/s Since v = u + at   A and B meet at Q i.e., 150 m from origin and 2s a = t after the start.  Speed of A = Slope of OQ = 150 = 75 m/s.  Speed of both the trains is uniform as s – t graph 			 = – 1.11 m/s is a straight line."
7,Q. 10. Express average velocity when the velocity of a constant but the velocity of body changes. body changes at a non-uniform rate and a uniform  Name the physical quantity which changes rate.,"Ans.  Accelerated motion. Net displacement i.e., Average velocity =  Velocity of a particle. Total time taken  Motion of satellite is accelerated because during In case the velocity of a body changes at a uniform their motion, the speed remains constant while rate, then the average velocity is given by the arithmetic mean of initial velocity and final velocity the direction of motion changes continuously. for a given period of time. i.e., Average velocity"
