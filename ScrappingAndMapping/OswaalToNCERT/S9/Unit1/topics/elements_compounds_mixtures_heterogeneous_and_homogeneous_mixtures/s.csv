List three differences between properties of metals and non-metals. ,"Metals :  Metals are sonorous i.e., they produce sound.  Metals can be beaten into thin sheets i.e., malleable.  Metals can be drawn into wires i.e., ductile. Non-metals :  Non-metals are non-sonorous as they do not produce any sound.  Non-metals are fragile.  Non-metals are non-ductile."
 Write one point of difference between concentration and solubility.
