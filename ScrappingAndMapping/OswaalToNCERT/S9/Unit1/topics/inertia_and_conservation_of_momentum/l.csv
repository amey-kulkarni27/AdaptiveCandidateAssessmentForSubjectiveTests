0,Q. 1. What is meant by ‘inertia’ ? What are different types of inertia ? Give two examples in each case. ,"Ans. Inability of the body to change by itself its state of rest or state of uniform motion is called inertia. Types : Inertia of rest : e.g. :  When a card is flicked with a finger the coin placed over it falls in the tumbler.  Only the carom coin at the bottom of a pile is removed when a fast moving carom striker hits it. Inertia of motion : e.g. :  When a moving bus stops suddenly, the luggage might slide towards the front side of the bus and fall.  We tend to fall forward when a bus suddenly stops. "
1,"Q. 2.  Define momentum. Write its S.I. unit.  How much momentum will an object of mass 10 kg transfer to the floor, if it falls from a height of 5 m . 5 Marks each  Explain how a karate player can break a pile of tiles with a single blow of his hand. ","Ans.  Momentum is the product of mass and velocity. SI unit of momentum is -kgm/s.  v2 = u2 + 2gh v2 = 2 + 2  v2 = 100 \ v = 10 m/s momentum = m × v 			 = 10 × 10 = 100 kg m/s  The karate player strikes the pile of tiles with his hand very fast. In doing so, the large momentum of fast moving hand is reduced to zero in a very short time. This exerts a very large force on the pile of tiles which is sufficient to break them. "
2,Q. 3.  State the law of conservation of momentum.  Observe the following diagram and answer the questions given below : Straw 		 Thread Balloon 		 Which direction does the balloon move when the thread tied to its neck is removed and why ?  State the conclusion drawn from this activity. ,"Ans.  When two or more bodies act upon one another their total momentum remains constant, provided no external forces are acting.   Air from inside the balloon escapes from the mouth of the balloon. 			Balloon moves in opposite direction that is from left to right. 		 Forces of action and reaction are equal and opposite. "
3,"Q. 4.  Two objects of masses 100 g and 200 g are moving along the same line and direction with velocities of 2 m/s and 1 m/s respectively. They collide and after the collision, the first object moves at a velocity of 1·67 m/s. Determine the velocity of second object.  If a man jumps out from a boat, the boat moves backwards. Why ? ","Ans.  m1 = 100 g = 0·1kg m2 = 200 g = 0·2 kg u1 = 2 m/s u2 = 1 m/s v1 = 1·67 m/s v2 = ? According to law of conservation of momentum 		 m1u1 + m2u2 = m1v1 + m2v2 		 0·1 × 2 + 0·2 × 1 = 0·1 × 1·67 + 0·2 × v2 0·2+ 0·2 = 0·167 + 0·2 v2 v2 = 1·165 m/s  It is based on Newton’s third law of motion. As boat is floating and is not fixed, so it moves backwards. "
