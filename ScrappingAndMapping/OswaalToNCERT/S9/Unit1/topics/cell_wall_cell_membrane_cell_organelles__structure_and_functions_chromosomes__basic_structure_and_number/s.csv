A student recorded the mass of dry raising as 2.0 g and the mass of raisins after soaking as 3.5g. Calculate the percentage of water absorbed by raisins. Write one precaution for this experiment. ,"Mass of dried raisin = 2.0 g Mass of dried raisins after soaking = 3.5 g Mass of water absorbed = 3.5 – 2.0 = 1.5 g Percentage of water absorbed = One precaution for this experiment is to keep the raisins inside the water, not on the surface. 1 + 1"
"In the experiment of determining the percentage of water absorbed by raisins, two students Somya and Zahira used the following formula respectively : w1 – w2 w – w1  ×  2 w1 w1  Which student used wrong formula ?  What are w1 and w2 in the correct formula ?                 Cheek cells are of irregular shape. Experimental procedure. Safranin stain is used. Glycerine acts as lubricant. Safranin gives pinkish red colour. Cell wall is present in onion peel. Diagrammatic truth. Diagrammatic truth. Experimental procedure. W2 refers mass after soaking water. Absorption increases with increase in temperature. First step is to take the mass of dry raisins.",% = Final wt – Initial wt Initial wt 
"A group of students recorded the following readings while performing the experiment to calculate the percentage of water absorbed by raisins. Calculate the percentage of water absorbed by raisins. Mass of dry raisins = 2.0 g Mass of raisins after absorbing water = 3.0 g , ",3g – 2g 2g  2
5 g of raisins were placed in distilled water for 24 hours. The mass of soaked raisins was found to be 7 g. Calculate the percentage of water absorbed by raisins. ,From formula = W2 – W1 W1  2
A teacher soaked 10 g raisins in 35 ml of distilled water in a beaker A and similar amount in beaker B. She maintained the temperature of beaker A at 20° C and beaker B at 40° C. After an hour compare the percentage of water absorbed by the raisins in beakers A and B. ,Percentage of water absorbed by the raisins is more in B and less in beaker A. It is because absorption of water in raisins increases with the increase in temperature.  2
"In an experiment, to prepare a temporary mount of onion peel, which stain is used for the peel and why peel is kept in water after staining ?",Small quantity of Safranin is used to stain onion peel. Peel is dipped in water after staining to remove the excess stain from the peel.
Name any other stain used for staining Onion peel. How excess glycerine can be removed from the cover slips ?,Methylene blue is the other stain used to stain Onion peel. Excess glycerine can be removed from the cover slip by using a piece of blotting paper.
Mention the features of the cells of Onion peel when it is seen under microscope.,"The cells are rectangular in shape, compactly arranged and without any intercellular spaces. Each cell has a distinct cell wall, a prominent nucleus and vacuole."
"In the experiment, to prepare a temporary mount of human cheek cells, which two materials are required to scrap cheek cell from the mouth.", A clear spatula  A toothpick.
"In the experiment, to prepare a temporary mount of human cheek cells, list any two precautions."," Cheeks should be scrapped gently to prevent injury.  While mounting the cover slip, avoid entry of air bubbles. www.cell.com en.wikipedia.org l www.sciencedirect.com l www.cellsalive.com qqq"
