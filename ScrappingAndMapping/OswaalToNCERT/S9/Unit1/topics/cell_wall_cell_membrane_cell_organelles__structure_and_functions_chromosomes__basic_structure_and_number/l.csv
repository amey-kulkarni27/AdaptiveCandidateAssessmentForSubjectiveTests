" What are the consequences of the following conditions ? 		 A cell having higher water concentration than the surrounding medium. 		  A cell having lower water concentration than the surrounding medium. 		 A cell having equal water concentration to its surrounding medium.  Name the materials of, which the cell membrane and cell wall are composed of. ",  When a cell possess higher water concentration than the surrounding medium then exosmosis occurs in the cell due to difference in concentration and cell shrinks. 	  	  When a cell has low water concentration than surrounding medium then endosmosis occurs that results in the swelling of the cell. 		 A cell having equal water concentration to its surrounding medium will not show any changes.  Cell wall is composed of cellulose and cell membrane is composed of lipids and proteins.
" Explain the terms :  Endocytosis,  Plasmolysis.  What will happen if the organisation of a cell is damaged due to certain physical or chemical reasons ? 5 Marks each  How do substances like CO2 and water move in and out of the cell ? ","  	 Endocytosis : The flexibility of the cell membrane enables the cell to engulf food and other materials from its external environment. Such process is known as endocytosis.  Plasmolysis : When a living plant cell loses water through osmosis, there is shrinkage or contraction of the contents of the cell away from the cell wall. This phenomenon is known as plasmolysis.  When the organisation of a cell gets damaged, lysosomes will burst and their enzymes will eat up their own cell organelles. Therefore, lysosomes are also known as the suicidal bags of the cell.  Gases like CO2 and O2 move in and out of the cell by diffusion from their higher concentration to lower concentration. Water enters the cell by endosmosis through semi-permeable plasma membrane from its higher concentration to lower concentration. Similarly, water moves out of the cell by exosmosis when a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution."
" What is the name given to the thread shaped structures in the nucleus ? Why is it important?  Draw a diagram of the nucleus to show the given parts :   nucleolus,  nuclear pore,  nuclear envelope. CELL — A BASIC UNIT OF LIFE", The thread shaped structures in the nucleus are known as chromosomes. These are important because they contain information for inheritance of features from parents to the next generation.  Nuclear envelope Nucleolus Nuclear pores  Put one teaspoon salt in cup C.  Put one teaspoon sugar in the boiled potato cup D. Keep this setup for two hours. Then observe the four potato cups and answer the following :  Explain why water gathers in the hollowed portion of B and C.  Why is potato A necessary for this experiment ?  Explain why water does not gather in the hollowed out portions of A and D.  Fresh peeled potato cup Sugar Chromosome
 What would happen if the plasma membrane ruptures or breaks down ?  What would happen to the life of a cell if there were no Golgi apparatus ? ," Plasma membrane is the selectively permeable membrane that surrounds the cell and allows the entry and exit of selected materials into and out of the cell. If it ruptures, the contents of the cell will come in direct contact with the surrounding medium and not only unwanted material will be able to enter freely into the cell, but useful material will also find its way out of the cell easily. This will seriously disrupt the various metabolic activities of the cell and will result in its eminent death.  If there were no Golgi apparatus, the material synthesized by Endoplasmic reticulum would not be carried to the various parts inside and outside the cell. Also as the Golgi apparatus performs the function of storage and modification of the material synthesized in the cell, these material could not be stored and modified further. Moreover, there will be no production of lysosomes which will cause the accumulation of waste material, viz. worn out and dead cell organelles within the cell which will ultimately lead to cell death."
"Carry out the following osmosis experiment : Take four peeled potato halves and scoop each one out to make potato cups. One of these potato cups should be made from a boiled potato. Put each potato cup in a trough containing water. Now,  Keep cup A empty.  Put one teaspoon sugar in cup B. Cup A Salt solution Cup B Fresh peeled potato cup Sugar solution Boiled Potato cup Cup C Cup D"," Water gathers in the hollowed portion of B and C because of the process of endosmosis . A potato is made up of several cells, and the cell membranes are selectively permeable. As the cups B and C are filled with sugar and salt respectively and their outer part is in contact with the water, the concentration of water outside the cups is higher than inside the cups, so water moves from its higher concentration towards the lower concentration, i.e., inside the cup.  Potato A acts as a control of the experiment. It is very necessary for comparing the results of the experiment and shows that if the conc. of water is same on both sides, there will be no movement of water.  Water does not gather in the hollowed out portions of A as it does not contain hypertonic solution so there is no concentration difference. Water does not gather in the cup D as the cells of boiled potato are dead and hence no osmosis occurs."
