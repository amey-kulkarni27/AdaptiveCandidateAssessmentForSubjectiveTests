Describe in short five methods by which you can increase the yield of crops and livestock. ,Canal system. Such a system receives water from rivers or from one or more reservoirs. It consists of main canals to which are attached many branch canals. These branch canals are connected to distributaries. Distributaries distribute water to the fields.

Also state three advantages of this cropping pattern.  Name any two fodder crops. , Mixed cropping. Advantages of mixed cropping :  Reduces risk  Insurance against failure of one crop 		 Gives variety in crop yield  Fodder crops : Barseem / Oats / Sudan grass.
"Cross breeding programme is successfully done in poultry farming. Enlist some desirable traits for which, cross breeding is done in poultry birds. ","The desired traits include :  Number and quality of chicks : The cross bred variety should produce good quality chicks in large quantities.  Dwarf broiler parent for commercial chick production.  Summer adaptation capacity : The variety should be adaptable to survive in high temperature and different climatic conditions.  Low maintenance requirement : It is also one of the important trait desired to decrease investment.  Reduction in the size of the egg laying bird with ability to utilize more fibrous cheaper diets formulated using agricultural by-products. 3 5 Marks each  By minimizing the application of fertilizers and pesticides.  By adopting integrated farming practices, e.g., combining agriculture with livestock.  By promoting the usage of livestock excreta for production of compost, we can supply required nutrients through soil."
 What is meant by composite fish culture ?  What is the basis of selecting the different species of fish ?  Which method is used to get pure fish seed ?, Combination of 5 or 6 fish species in a single fish pond.  Species are selected so that they do not compete for food. Food available in all parts of the pond is utilized. This increases fish yield  Hormonal Stimulation  5 Detailed answer :  Composite fish culture is the poly culture system in which combination of 5 or 6 fish species are selected and grown in a single fish bond.  The selection of different species of fish is done so that they do not compete for food and the food available in all the parts of the pond is utilized. This increases the fish yield.  Hormonal stimulation.
“Continuous use of fertilizers destroys soil fertility”. Hence long term use of fertilizers is substituted by different cropping pattern. Discuss three new techniques of cropping pattern of their significance. ,"Three different cropping patterns, namely mixed cropping, intercropping, and crop rotation are generally practised.  Mixed cropping allows two or more crops to be sowed simultaneously in the same land. Wheat and gram, wheat and mustard, ground nut and sunflower etc. are some common examples of mixed cropping. Mixed cropping also increases soil fertility by maintaining microbial diversity. In mixed cropping, crops are chosen in such a way that they require different amounts of minerals.  Intercropping allow farmers to grow two or more crops simultaneously in the same field in a definite pattern. For example, cauliflower and chilli plants are grown together in alternating rows. To ensure the maximum utilization of nutrients applied, crops are selected in such a way that their nutrient requirements are different. Other examples include soyabean and maize, finger miller  and cowpea  etc.  Crop rotation is the practice of growing two or more varieties of crops in the same region in sequential seasons. A common example of crop rotation is to cultivate maize followed by soyabean. This system also helps in preventing crops from pests and diseases. The crops selected, vary in nutrient requirements. This ensures complete and uniform utilization of nutrients."
 List the different ways in which biotic and abiotic factors affect stored food grains ?   What preventive and controlling measures need to be taken before and after storing the grains ?  Name two weeds. ," Biotic factors like insects, rodents, fungi, mites and abiotic factors like inappropriate temperature and moisture cause degradation in quality, loss in weight, poor germination, discolouration of produce, all leading to poor marketability.  The preventive and control measures include strict cleaning of the produce before storage, proper drying of the produce first in sunlight and then in shade and fumigation using chemicals.  Xanthium and Parthenium."
" Briefly describe the formation of vermicompost and green manure. ,  How can poultry fowl be prevented from various diseases ? State any three methods. "," Compost and vermicompost : The process in which farm waste material, vegetable waste, animal refuse, domestic waste, sewage, straw, eradicated weeds etc. are decomposed in pits. It is rich in organic matter and nutrients. Compost is also prepared by using earthworms to hasten the process of decomposition of plant and animal refuse. This is vermicompost. Green Manure : Manure prepared by the green plants like sunhemp or guar that are grown prior to the sowing of the crop seeds.   Appropriate vaccination. 		 Spraying of disinfectants at regular intervals. 		 Proper cleaning, sanitation, hygienic conditions in housing and poultry feed.  2 + 3"
Unpredictable monsoon / droughts / low rainfall is adversly affecting the Indian agriculture.  Mention any two initiatives that have been adopted to increase the availability of water for agricultural purposes.  State two advantages of making check dams.  Briefly describe canal and river lift system of irrigation. , Rain water harvesting and water shed management.  Two advantages of check dams : 		 Increase the ground water level 		 Reduce soil erosion 		 Prevent rain water from flowing away   Canal system : From rivers /reservoirs to crop field through system of canals. River lift system : Water is drawn from rivers for supplementing irrigation. 
India has a wide variety of water resources and a highly varied climate. Describe in brief any five kinds of irrigation systems adopted to supply water to agricultural lands. , Dug well : Water is collected from water bearing strata. Tube well : Water is collected from deeper strata.  Canals : Extensive irrigation system. Canal receives water from one/more water reservoirs.  River lift system : In areas where canal cannot flow or canal flow is insufficient due to inadequate reservoir release. This system is more rational.  Tanks : Small storage reservoirs which intercept or store the run-off of smaller catchment area.  Rain water harvesting watershed management for increasing the water available for agriculture. 
What are pests ? How can plant pests be controlled ? In what way biopesticides are better than the chemical pesticides ? ,"Pests are destructive organisms which cause destruction of crop plants and their products. Plant pests can be controlled by using resistant variety of crop plants, inter-cropping and summer ploughing. Chemical pesticides cause pollution and harm useful insects whereas biopesticides are eco-friendly.  1+2+2"
Define fumigation and fumigant. Give an example of a fumigant. How does fumigation differ from spraying ? Give two points. ,"Fumigation is a method in which the insecticide solution is converted into fumes to kill the insects; fumigants are the insecticides which are used for making such fumes. Example : EDB . In fumigation, the solution is converted into fumes and it is done during the storage of food grains whereas in spraying the solution remains in liquid form and it is done either before or after the storage of food grains. "
An Italian bee variety A. mellifera has been introduced in India for honey production. Write about its four merits over other varieties. List two local varieties of Indian bee used for honey production. What is pasturage and how is it related to honey production ?,"Italian bee has high honey collection capacity, stings somewhat less, stays in a given beehive for long periods and breeds very well. Apis cerana indica  and Apis dorsata. Pasturage is the flowers available to the bees for nectar and pollen collection. The adequate quantity of pasturage and the kind of flower will determine the taste of honey."
"The quantity and the quality of food is decreasing day by day. As population is increasing drastically, mention the steps taken to improve this condition.",The following steps should be taken to improve the conditions of food :  By selecting good hybrid varieties of crop having desirable agronomic traits.  The field should be kept fertile and nutrient rich and it should be managed properly.  By using high yielding variety seeds for high yield per acre.  By using a beneficial cropping pattern either mixed cropping or crop rotation.  By improving the irrigation facilities.
