0,Q. 1. Make a comparison and write down ways in which plant cells are different from animal cell. ,"Ans. Differences between plant cells and animal cells : S. No. Plant Cells Animal Cells Plant cells are larger Animal cells are in size. comparatively smaller in size. They contain cell wall Cell wall is absent. made of cellulose, which is present outside the plasma membrane. They contain plastids, Plastids are absent. i.e., chloroplast, leucoplast and chromoplast. Centrosome absent. Larger vacuoles are Vacuoles either present. absent or very small in size. is Centrosome present. is Food is stored in the Food is stored in the form of starch. form of glycogen. Lysosomes either More number of absent or very few in prominent lysosomes number. are present.  1 × 5"
1,Q. 2. Describe the structure of the plant cell. ,"Ans. A plant cell consists of : 1. Cell wall : The outermost covering made mainly of non-living cellulose which gives distinct shape to the cell. 2. Plasma membrane : It is also called cell membrane. It is a thin, delicate and elastic covering lying inner to the cell wall. It controls the entry and exit of selected molecules and ions, and is selectively permeable. Cytoplasm : It is a viscous, homogeneous colloidal liquid and consists of a number of living and non-living structures. The living structures are the cell organelles and include structures like mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, vacuoles etc. Cytoplasm keeps the cell fully expanded and provides turgidity to the cell. Chloroplasts are present only in the cytoplasm of plant cell. 4. Nucleus : It is dense spherical body bounded by a membrane which is called nuclear membrane. A number of thread-like structures called chromosomes with genes on them are embedded within the nuclear sap. The nucleus controls the various metabolic activities of the cell and so is called the control centre of the cell. For diagram See Q. No. 2 SAQ "

Which parts are concerned with the following functions :  	Release of energy,  	Protein synthesis, CELL — A BASIC UNIT OF LIFE  Transmission of hereditary characters from parents to their offsprings.  Mention any two structures, found only in plant cell not in animal cell. ","Ans. 	  1. Mitochondria, 2. Cytoplasm, 3. Ribosome, 4. Smooth Endoplasmic reticulum, 5. Rough Endoplasmic reticulum, Nucleolus, 7. Nucleoplasm, 8. Nuclear membrane, 9. Centrosome, 10. Golgi apparatus   Mitochondria,  Ribosome,  Nucleus,  1. Cell wall and 2. Plastids"
