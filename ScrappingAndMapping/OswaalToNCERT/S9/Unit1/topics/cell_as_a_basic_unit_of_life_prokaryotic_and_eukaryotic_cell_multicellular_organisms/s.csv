0,Q. 1. Cell size may range from a few micro metre to a metre. Support this statement with the help of examples.  2 Marks each,"Ans. Many cells are visible only under a microscope e.g., Mycoplasma is the smallest cell and longest cell in human body is nerve cell or neuron. "
1,Q. 2. Why is it said that ‘‘a cell without nucleus is without any future’’? ,Ans. Nucleus is called the control centre of the cell as it controls all the metabolic activities going in the cell directly or indirectly and also in formation of various cell organelles by controlling the synthesis of proteins.
2,Q. 1.  Write two points of difference between nuclear region of a bacterial cell and nuclear region of an animal cell.  Which structure present in the nuclear region of a living cell bear genes ? ,Ans.  S. No. Nuclear region of Nuclear region of an bacterial cell animal cell  Poorly defined and Well defined and lacks any covering. membrane bound.  Has single Has more than one chromosome. chromosome. CELL — A BASIC UNIT OF LIFE  Lacks organelles. true Well defined membrane bound cell organelles present.  Chromosomes bear ‘genes’.

5,Q. 5. Write three differences between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic cells. ,"Ans. Difference between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic cell : S. Prokaryotic cell Eurkaryotic cell No. Size : generally small Size : generally  1 µm = 10–6 large  m. Nuclear region : containing only nucleic acid and is undefined due to the absence of nuclear membrane and known as nucleoid. Nuclear region : well defined and surrounded by a nuclear membrane. Chromosome : single. Chromosome : more than one chromosome M e m b r a n e -bou n d Membrane bound c e l l - o r g a n e l l e s cell organelles absent. (e.g., chloroplasts, golgi bodies etc.) present.  1 × 3 "
6,Q. 6. Draw and label the parts of prokaryotic cell. ,Ans. Ribosomes Capsule Cytoplasm Bacterial flagellum DNA  Plasma membrane  1 + 2
7,Q. 7.  Why is the cell called the structural and functional unit of life ?  Why is the plasma membrane called a selectively permeable membrane ?  Name the factor which decides the movement of water across the plasma membrane. ,Ans.  Because shape and size of cells are related to specific functions they perform. Cells constitute various components of plants and animals.  Because it permits exit and entry of some selected materials in and out of the cells.  Amount of substance dissolved in water or solute concentration.
