"Calculate the net force acting on a bus boarded with passenger, of mass 2000 kg moving with a uniform velocity of 60 km/hr. ","Since velocity is uniform, acceleration will be zero therefore net force is zero.   1"
"If a balloon filled with air and its mouth untied, the air is released from its mouth in the downward direction, and balloon moves upwards. Identify action and reaction in this case.  1 Mark each",Release of air in downward direction is action. Movement of balloon in upward direction is reaction.  1
"In a tug of war, the rope does not move in any direction. Why ? ",Because the forces applied by the two teams are equal and opposite.  1
Name the force which is responsible for change in position or state of an object. ,Unbalanced forces. 
Rakesh tries to push a box on a rough floor but is unable to move it. Name the force which balances the force applied by him.,Force of friction. 1
Given below are some measuring units of different physical quantities :,Water is ejected from a hose with a large amount of force . Hence as per Newton’s III law there will be an equal and opposite force on the hose pipe making it difficult to hold. 
Give one point of difference between balanced and unbalanced forces. ,"When forces acting on a body from all sides are equal, they cancel effect of each other and are known as balanced forces. On the other hand, when forces acting on a body are not equal/do not cancel each other are called unbalanced forces. 1 "
Why does the sole of the shoe wears out ? ,Sole of the shoe wears out due to friction between sole of the shoes and earth’s surface. 
State the meaning of recoil velocity of a gun ? ,"Force of friction.  1 kg - ms-2, ms-2, kg - ms-1, ms-1, kg - m2 s-2. Select the units which measure force and momentum respectively."
Why are the athletes in a high jump event made to fall either on a cushioned bed or on a sand bed ? ,To reduce the rate of change of momentum and hence the force.  1
"During the game of table tennis, if the ball hits a player it does not hurt him. On the other hand when a fast moving cricket ball hits a spectator it may hurt him. State the reason. ",Changing in speed/change of direction/change of shape.  1 
"State two effects, a force can produce in a non rigid body fixed at a position. ",Change its shape and size. 
"State an example, how force can change velocity of a body. ",The momentum of a cricket ball is larger than a table tennis ball so it hurts the spectator. 
Velocity-time graph of a moving particle of mass 1 kg is shown in figure. Vel ocit y ,Acceleration becomes half. 
Mention any two kinds of changes that can be brought about in a body by force. ,"Acceleration = 0, F = ma. So, F = 0, force acting is zero.  1"
A force is applied on a metal block lying on floor in one direction. Still the block does not move. Name the force which is balancing it. ,Force of friction between metal surface and floor.  1
Find the acceleration produced by a force of 12 N exerted on an object of mass 3 kg. ,"F = ma ⇒ 12 = 3 × a, a = 12/3 = 4 m/s2. "
What is the net momentum of gun and bullet system after firing ? ,"The momentum of gun and bullet system after firing is equal to initial momentum, i.e., zero, because no external force is acting."
A body accelerates when balanced force acts on it. Is it true or false ? Why ?,"It is false because momentum of a body changes only when, an unbalanced force acts on it."
