0,"Q. 1. Shivansh wants to find out force exerted by his car, he plotted a velocity–time graph for his journey on highway. Shivansh wondered if he did not accelerate after every minute and the fuel spent by the engine. His wife reminded him that his car overcame friction due to road.  What values were shown by Shivansh ?  How does he find the total displacement ?  What values were shown by his wife ?","Ans.  Shivansh showed experimental, observatory and skillful behaviour.  Displacement = Area under the v – t curve.  His wife showed smart, knowledgeable, logical and practical behaviour."
1,"Q. 2. During the training Sahil’s cricket coach taught him to pull his hands backwards while catching a fast moving cricket ball.  Was Sahil’s coach correct ?  Why does a fielder in the ground gradually pull his hands backwards with the ball, while catching a fast moving cricket ball ?  What would happen if a fielder does not take the advice properly ?  What value is associated with it ?","Ans.  Yes.  While catching a fast moving cricket ball, a fielder pulls his hands backwards with the ball. By doing so, the fielder increases the time during which the high velocity of the moving ball decreases to zero. Thus the acceleration of the ball is decreased and therefore the impact of catching the fast moving ball is also reduced and the fielder gets less hurt.  On the contrary, if the ball is stopped suddenly, the high velocity decreases to zero in a very short interval of time. Thus the rate of change of momentum of the ball is very large. Therefore, large force is applied for holding the catch that might hurt the palm of the fielder.  This shows that Sahil’s coach is intelligent and a good trainer."
