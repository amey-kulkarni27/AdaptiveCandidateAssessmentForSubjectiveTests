0,"Q. 1.  State Newton’s second Law of Motion. Express it mathematically and find SI unit of force from it.  In the diagram given above, if the card is flicked away with a jerk, what will you observe ? Explain the reason for this observation. ",Ans.  Newton’s second Law of motion states that the rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in the direction of force. It is expressed mathematically as F ∝ m ×  t F = km ×  = kma t 			= k ×  ×  Force = kg ms–2  We well observe that the card moves ahead allowing the coin to fall vertically into the glass. This is due to inertia. The inertia of the coin tries to maintain its state of rest.

2,"Q. 12  F = ma F= m ×  t Ft = m  That is, when F = 0, then v = u. Thus the object will continue to move with uniform velocity. m = 800 kg, 5 Marks each  A plastic ball and a cricket ball are rolled on the floor with same velocity. Which one will cover larger distance before stopping ? Give reason.  A truck is moving with a velocity of 72 km/h and it takes 3s to stop after the brakes are applied. Calculate the force exerted by brakes. Mass of truck is 1200 kg. 		 ","Ans.  According to first law of motion, everybody tends to resist change of state whether in rest or in motion. Qualitatively this tendency of the body to stay at rest or keep moving with same velocity is called inertia.  Cricket ball (because its mass is larger, so inertia of motion is larger)  u = 72 km/h = 20 m/s v = 0 v = u + at a = – 20/3 			 = – 6·6 m/s2 Now; F = ma 			 = – 7920 N"
3,"Q. 4.  Write an activity to distinguish between a balanced and an unbalanced force.  Explain whether the force is balanced or unbalanced in the following situations. 		 A suitcase is dropped from a certain height. 		 A bicycle is moving in a straight line with constant velocity. 		 In the game of tug of war, the two teams apply force but the rope doesn’t move. 		 A ball rolling on the ground stops after sometime.  ","Ans.  Balanced forces : 		 A box doesn’t move when a small force is applied. 		 Force is balanced. Unbalanced forces : 		 The box starts moving, when the applied force is increased. 		 Force is unbalanced.   Unbalanced : because the box is coming down with increasing velocity. 		 Balanced : because velocity is constant. 		 Balanced : since rope does not go the either side , both are applying equal and opposite forces. F = 200 N  Unbalanced : Since velocity of ball is decreasing."
4,"Q. 5. Give statement for Newton’s second law of motion. Deduce a mathematical formulation for it. Using above derived expression, calculate the F 200 1 a= = = 0.25 m/s m 800 4 force exerted by a nail on the hammer of mass 500 g moving at 5·0 m/s striking it. Consider that the nail stops the hammer in a short time of 0·01 s. ","Ans. Newton’s 2nd law of motion states that the force acting on a body is directly proportional to the product of its mass and acceleration produced by it in the body. The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied on it and the change takes place in the direction of applied force. Suppose a body of mass m is acted on by a force F. Mathematical derivation : If the force ‘F’ changes its velocity from u to v in time t, then rate of change of momentum can be written as  t m t This is equal to the force applied on the body by m  second law t Hence, F = ma m = 500 g = 0·5 kg, v =0 t = 0·01 s Acceleration of hammer = u = 50 m/s, a = – 5000 m/s2 		Force applied by the nail on hammer f = ma = 0·5 ×  			 = – 2500 N."

What will be your observation if the above coin is replaced by a heavy five rupee coin. Justify your answer. ,"Ans.  We observe that the card moves ahead while coin falls in glass. The coin possesses inertia of rest, it resists the change and hence falls in the glass.  Newton’s first law of motion : . SAQ 3 marks).  Heavy coin will possess more inertia so it will fall in tumbler."
6,Q. 8.  State the law that provides the formula for measuring force and the law which provides the definition of force.  Velocity time graph of a 50 g marble rolling on a floor is given below. Find : 		 time in which it stops. 		 negative acceleration produced on it. 		 positive force acting on the marble  ,"Ans. The force acting on a body is directly proportional to the rate of change of momentum of the body, according to Newton’s second law. Force is equal to 1 newton if it produces an acceleration of 1 m/s2 in a body of unit mass.  By reducing the speed of hand suddenly, the player decreases the time of change of momentum. This increases the impact of force exerted on the tile.  When athletes fall on a soft surface, their velocity becomes zero in a longer duration of time. Thus, rate of momentum change decreases and less force is exerted by ground on their body. V el oci t y "
7,Q. 7. In the figure below the card is flicked with a push. Time ,Ans.  Formula for measuring force is given by Newton’s 2nd law.

8,"Q. 9.  When a bullet is fired from a gun, the gun moves backward. Give reason.  A gun of mass 500 g fires a bullet of mass 10 g with a speed of 100 m/s. Find : 		 Initial momentum of ‘gun + bullet’. 		 Momentum gained by the bullet after firing. 		 Recoil velocity of the gun. ",Ans.  Gun exerts force on bullet in forward direction. In turn bullet also exerts an equal and opposite force in backward direction.   Zero . 		 Momentum gained by bullet 			= m1v1 = ×100 = 1 kgm/s 		 m1u1 + m2u2 = m1v1 + m2v2 v v2 = – 2 m/s 1 + 1 + 1½ + 1½ 
9,"Q. 10.  Give reasons for following :  Glass wares are wrapped in straw during their transportation. 		 When a bullet is fired, it exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun, yet hurt caused by recoil of the gun is much less than that by bullet.  A force of 100 N acts on a body of mass 20 kg initially at rest for 5s. Determine. 		 acceleration, 		 final velocity attained by it, 		 distance covered by it. ",Ans.   During transport if there are jerks then straw being soft gets compressed and increases the time of change of momentum. So impact on glass would be reduced.  Since gun is of larger mass so the recoil velocity is very small and so it does not hurt.   a = = 5 m/s2 		 v = 0 + 5 × 5 = 25 m/s 		 s = 0 + ½ × 5 × 25 = 62·5 m 
10,"Q. 11. Look at the diagram above and answer the following questions : Wall Reaction 4N Spring balance Action 4N   When a force is applied through the free end of the spring balance A the reading on the spring balance A is 20 gwt. What will be the reading shown by the spring balance B ?  Write reasons for your answer. 		 If a balloon is filled with air and its mouth untied, air is released from its mouth in the downward direction. Write the other observations made by you. Justify your answer. ","Ans.   Spring balance B will also show 20 gwt. 		 It is because of Newton’s III law of motion, when spring balance A exerts force on the balance B then the balance B pulls the balance A with an equal force of 20 gwt, but in the opposite direction. Balance A exerts a force of action on balance B then balance B exerts an equal and opposite force of reaction on balance A. 		 It is observed that the balloon moves in the upward direction as air comes out from the balloon. It performs an action in the downward direction as a result of which there will be a reaction (equal in magnitude but opposite in direction) in the form of upward motion. "
11,"Q. 12. A large bus and a van, both moving with a velocity of magnitude v, have a head-on-collision and both the vehicles stop after the collision. If the time of the collision is 1 sec then,  Which vehicle experiences smaller force of impact ?  Which vehicle experiences the smaller momentum change ?  Which vehicle experiences the greater acceleration ?  Why is it that the truck suffers less damage than the car ? ","Ans.  According to 2nd law of motion a = F/m a ∝ F = ma = m /t or m When Acceleration experienced by the bus ∝ Acceleration experienced by the van ∝ Ft = mv – mu F = 0, v = u for every value of time. This implies that the body will continue to move with uniform velocity. If u = 0 then v = 0 i.e., the body will remain at rest. m1  u = 0, g = 10 m/s2 h = 80 cm = 0·8 m m2 Since m2 < m1, therefore the van experiences greater acceleration  Due to the transfer of small momentum from the van to the bus, the truck suffers less damage than the car. v2 = u2 + 2gh v2 = 0 + 2 × 10 × 0.8 v2 = 16 v = 4 m/s Change in momentum = mv – mu "
