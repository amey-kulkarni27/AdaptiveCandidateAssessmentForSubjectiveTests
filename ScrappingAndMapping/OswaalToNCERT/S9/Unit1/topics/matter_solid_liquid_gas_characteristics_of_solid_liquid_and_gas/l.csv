"Compare in tabular form, the properties of solids, liquids and gases with respect to :  shape,  volume,  compressibility,  diffusion,  fluidity or rigidity. ","S. No. Property Solids Gases  Shape Definite shape No definite shape, takes No definite shape, takes the shape of container the shape of container  Volume Definite volume Definite volume No definite volume  Compressibility Non-compressible Slightly compressible Highly compressible  Diffusion Can diffuse in liquids Can diffuse in liquids Can diffuse in other gases  Fluidity or rigidity Rigid Shows fluidity Shows fluidity"
 List any two properties that liquids have in common with gases.  Give two reasons to justify that an iron almirah is a solid at room temperature.  What happens to the heat energy which is supplied to the solid once it starts melting ? ,  Gases and liquids do not have fixed shape.  Gases and liquids flow easily.   The shape does not change when pressed i.e. it is hard and rigid. It has a definite shape and has high density.   The heat energy supplied is taken up by solid particles and helps in melting or fusion.  2 + 2 + 1
" Distinguish between solids and gases on the basis of following parameters :  Interparticle distance  Interparticle forces of attraction,  Compressibility.   Give two factors that determine the rate of diffusion of a liquid in another liquid. ", Differences between Solids and Gases : S. No. Liquids Solids Gases  Interparticle space is Interparticle space is small so the distance maximum so the distance is less. is more.  Interparticle force Interparticle force of of attraction is attraction is minimum. maximum.  Solids are rigid and Gases are not rigid and non-compressible. they are compressible.  The two factors that determine the rate of diffusion of a liquid in another liquid are :  Temperature  Pressure
" Explain with the help of an activity which shows that particles of matter are very small.  Define matter. Name the states of matter in which the forces between the constituent particles are :  strongest,  weakest.  When sugar and common salt are kept in different jars, they take the shape of the jars. Are they solid ? Justify your answer. ","  Take 2-3 crystals of copper sulphate and dissolve in 100 ml of water.  Take out approximate 10 ml of this solution and put it into 90 ml of clear water.  Take out 10 ml of this solution and put it into another 90 ml of clear water.  Keep diluting for 5-8 times. Inference : A crystal of copper sulphate contains millions of tiny particles which keeps on dividing into smaller and smaller numbers with each dilution.  Anything which possesses mass and occupies space is called matter.  Solid – strongest,  Gas – weakest.  The shape of each individual sugar or salt crystal remains fixed. Therefore, they are solids. "
" Arrange the following in the increasing order of  force of attraction,  intermolecular space : iron nail, kerosene and oxygen gas.  Define the following terms :  Rigidity,  Compressibility,  Diffusion. ",  Force of attraction : Oxygen gas < Kerosene < Iron nail  Intermolecular space : Iron nail < Kerosene < Oxygen gas   Rigidity : It is the property of matter to maintain shape against external force.  Compressibility : It is the property of matter by virtue of which molecules of matter are brought closer to each other.  Diffusion : The inter mixing of the particles of matter is known as diffusion. 
" Describe an activity to show that the particles of matter are continuously moving using red ink, honey and water in beakers. What is the effect of increase of temperature on the movement of particles ? Give reason.  Why is oxygen called a gas ? Give two reasons. "," Take two beakers filled with water, put a drop of red ink in one beaker and honey in the second beaker and leave them undisturbed. After sometime it can be observed that the colour of the ink spreads evenly throughout the water and also the honey in the second beaker. This happens because the molecules continuously keep on moving. When temperature is increased, the movement of particles become faster. This is due to increase in their kinetic energy.   Oxygen has neither fixed volume nor fixed shape.  Oxygen exerts pressure due to collision of the molecules on the walls of containing vessel and among themselves."
