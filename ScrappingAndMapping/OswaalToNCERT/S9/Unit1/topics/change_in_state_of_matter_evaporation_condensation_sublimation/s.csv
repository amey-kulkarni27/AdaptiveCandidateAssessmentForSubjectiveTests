Why are pieces of pumice stone placed in the container before heating water while determining the boiling point of water in the laboratory ? Explain briefly.,"Pieces of pumice stones are placed in the container before heating to avoid bumping of liquid when the temperature increase. On boiling, water releases energy as bubbles. If the bubbles do not form it can develop lot of heat and possibly explode. Addition of stones given lots of surface area for bubbles to form and release the energy gradually."
"To find the boiling point of water, three students A, B and C used distilled water at 0°C, at room temperature and luke warm respectively. Compare the boiling point of water observed by the three students and give reason for your answer. ","The value of the boiling point does not depend on the temperature of the liquid when pressure is kept constant. Thus, all the three students will observe same boiling point."
"In an experiment to determine the melting point of ice, mention two important precautions to be taken. ", The bulb of the thermometer should be completely inside the crushed ice.  The solution should be stirred regularly to keep a uniform temperature. 
"In an experiment to determine the boiling point of water, the stop watch used to note down the temperature of water at different intervals of time has 20 divisions between 0 to 10s marks. Find the least count of the stop watch. (Board Term I, 2015, 3GS246G, Board 2014, Set-MNM9GZH) 18.  19 divisions is equivalent to 9·5°C. Thus overall temperature is 99·5°C. 19.  Distilled water does not contain any impurity. 20.  To make sure that the boiling point obtained is accurate even when water sample contains nonvolatile impurities dissolved. 21.  Liquid, solid, gas. 22.  On boiling, temperature remains constant till all the water is converted into steam. 23.  10 C/20 div.= 0·5. 24.  Boiling point may increase due to presence of impurities. 25.  Pumice stone pieces helps in avoiding bumping. 26.  It has a wide range of temperature tolerance.",Least count = 10/20 = 0.5   2
"In an experiment to determine the melting point of ice in laboratory, what form of ice should be preferably used ? When should the reading of thermometer be noted ? ", Crushed ice preferably from distilled water.  When whole of the ice melts and temperature becomes constant. 
"In an experiment to determine the boiling point of water, mention two important precautions to be taken. ", Pumice stone pieces should be added to stop bumping of water.  The thermometer should be just above the surface of water.  1 + 1
"In an experiment to determine the boiling point of water, state reason for the following precautions :   The bulb of thermometer should not touch the sides of beaker.  While boiling water, pumice stones should be added.", Sides of the beaker are at slightly higher temperature.  To avoid bumping.  1 + 1
Why do we fix a two holed-cork in the round bottom flask while determining the boiling point of water ?,We fix a two holed-cork in the round bottom flask in order to fix the thermometer through one of the holes in the cork and the glass tube through the other.
Why does the temperature of a substance remain constant during its melting point or boiling point ?,"During melting, latent heat of fusion and during boiling, latent heat of vaporisation overcome the interparticle force of attraction, therefore, temperature remains constant. www.excellup.com www.gradestack.com www.physicscatalyst.com www.en.wikipedia.org www.chem4kids.com www.edinformatics.com qqq"
