Outcomes of Democracy

As we begin to wind up our tour of democracy, it is time to move
beyond our discussion of specific themes and ask a general set of
questions: What does democracy do? Or, what outcomes can we
reasonably expect of democracy? Also, does democracy fulfil these
expectations in real life? We begin by thinking about how to assess
the outcomes of democracy. After some clarity on how to think on
this subject, we proceed to look at the expected and actual outcomes
of democracy in various respects: quality of government, economic
well-being, inequality, social differences and conflict and finally
freedom and dignity. Our final verdict – positive but qualified –
leads us to think about the challenges to democracy in the next
and final chapter.

How do we assess democracy’s outcomes?

Did we reach
these
conclusions in
Madam Lyngdoh’s
class? I loved
that class
because
students were
not being
dictated any
conclusions.

Do you remember how students in
Madam Lyngdoh’s class argued about
democracy? This was in Chapter 2 of
Class IX textbook. It emerged from that
conversation that democracy is a better
form of government when compared
with dictatorship or any other alternative.
We felt that democracy was better
because it:
l Promotes equality among citizens;
l Enhances the dignity of the
individual;
l Improves the quality of decisionmaking;
l Provides a method to resolve
conflicts; and
l Allows room to correct mistakes.

Democratic Politics

Are these expectations realised under
democracies? When we talk to people
around us, most of them support
democracy against other alternatives,
such as rule by a monarch or military or
religious leaders. But not so many of
them would be satisfied with the
democracy in practice. So we face a
dilemma: democracy is seen to be good

Is democracy all about coping with multiple pressures and
accommodating diverse demands?

90

in principle, but felt to be not so good in
its practice. This dilemma invites us to
think hard about the outcomes of
democracy. Do we prefer democracy
only for moral reasons? Or are there
some prudential reasons to support
democracy too?
Over a hundred countries of the
world today claim and practice some
kind of democratic politics: they have
formal constitutions, they hold elections,
they have parties and they guarantee rights
of citizens. While these features are
common to most of them, these
democracies are very much different
from each other in terms of their social
situations, their economic achievements
and their cultures. Clearly, what may be
achieved or not achieved under each of
these democracies will be very different.
But is there something that we can expect
from every democracy, just because it is
democracy?
Our interest in and fascination for
democracy often pushes us into taking a
position that democracy can address all
socio-economic and political problems.
If some of our expectations are not met,
we start blaming the idea of democracy.
Or, we start doubting if we are living in
a democracy. The first step towards
thinking carefully about the outcomes
of democracy is to recognise that
democracy is just a form of government.
It can only create conditions for achieving
something. The citizens have to take
advantage of those conditions and
achieve those goals. Let us examine some
of the things we can reasonably expect
from democracy and examine the record
of democracy.

Accountable, responsive and legitimate government

Let us think in terms of costs.
Imagine a government that may take
decisions very fast. But it may take
decisions that are not accepted by the
people and may therefore face problems.
In contrast, the democratic government
will take more time to follow
procedures before arriving at a decision.
But because it has followed procedures,
its decisions may be both more
acceptable to the people and more
effective. So, the cost of time that
democracy pays is perhaps worth it.

Now look at the other side –
democracy ensures that decision making
will be based on norms and procedures.
So, a citizen who wants to know if a
decision was taken through the correct
procedures can find this out. She has the
right and the means to examine the
process of decision making. This is
known as transparency. This factor is
often missing from a non-democratic
government. Therefore, when we are
trying to find out the outcomes of
democracy, it is right to expect
democracy to produce a government
that follows procedures and is
accountable to the people. We can also
expect that the democratic government
develops mechanisms for citizens to hold
the government accountable and
mechanisms for citizens to take part in
decision making whenever they think fit.
If you wanted to measure
democracies on the basis of this
expected outcome, you would look for
the following practices and institutions:
regular, free and fair elections; open
public debate on major policies and

Can you think of what
and how the
government knows
about you and your
family (for example
ration cards and
voter identity cards)?
What are the sources
of information for you
about the
government?

Outcomes of Democracy

Before we go into this question, we
face another common question: Is the
democratic government efficient? Is it
effective? Some people think that
democracy produces less effective
government. It is, of course, true that
non-democratic rulers do not have to
bother about deliberation in assemblies or
worry about majorities and public opinion.
So, they can be very quick and efficient in
decision making and implementation.
Democracy is based on the idea of
deliberation and negotiation. So, some delay
is bound to take place. Does that make
democratic government inefficient?

Governmental Secrecy

There are some things that democracy
must provide. In a democracy, we are
most concerned with ensuring that
people will have the right to choose their
rulers and people will have control over
the rulers. Whenever possible and
necessary, citizens should be able to
participate in decision making, that affects
them all. Therefore, the most basic
outcome of democracy should be that
it produces a government that is
accountable to the citizens, and
responsive to the needs and expectations
of the citizens.

91

legislations; and citizens’ right to
information about the government and
its functioning. The actual performance
of democracies shows a mixed record
on this. Democracies have had greater
success in setting up regular and free
elections and in setting up conditions for
open public debate. But most
democracies fall short of elections that
provide a fair chance to everyone and in
subjecting every decision to public debate.
Democratic governments do not have a
very good record when it comes to
sharing information with citizens. All one
can say in favour of democratic regimes
is that they are much better than any
non-democratic regime in these respects.

So, the best
outcome of
democracy is
that it is a
democracy! That
is what we have
discovered after
all this mental
gymnastics?

In substantive terms it may be
reasonable to expect from democracy a
government that is attentive to the needs
and demands of the people and is largely
free of corruption. The record of
democracies is not impressive on these
two counts. Democracies often frustrate
the needs of the people and often ignore
the demands of a majority of its

population. The routine tales of
corruption are enough to convince us that
democracy is not free of this evil. At the
same time, there is nothing to show that
non-democracies are less corrupt or
more sensitive to the people.
There is one respect in which
democratic government is certainly
better than its alternatives: democratic
government is legitimate government.
It may be slow, less efficient, not always
very responsive or clean. But a
democratic government is people’s own
government. That is why there is an
overwhelming support for the idea of
democracy all over the world. As the
accompanying evidence from South
Asia shows, the support exists in
countries with democratic regimes as
well as countries without democratic
regimes. People wish to be ruled by
representatives elected by them. They
also believe that democracy is suitable
for their country. Democracy’s ability
to generate its own support is itself an
outcome that cannot be ignored.

Economic growth and development
If democracies are expected to produce
good governments, then is it not fair to
expect that they would also produce
development? Evidence shows that in
practice many democracies did not fulfil
this expectation.
If you consider all democracies and
all dictatorships for the fifty years between
1950 and 2000, dictatorships have slightly
higher rate of economic growth. The
inability of democracy to achieve higher
economic development worries us. But
this alone cannot be reason to reject
democracy. As you have already studied
in economics, economic development
depends on several factors: country’s
population size, global situation,

cooperation from other countries,
economic priorities adopted by the
country, etc. However, the difference in
the rates of economic development
between less developed countries with
dictatorships and democracies is
negligible. Overall, we cannot say that
democracy is a guarantee of economic
development. But we can expect
democracy not to lag behind
dictatorships in this respect.
When we find such significant
difference in the rates of economic
growth between countries under
dictatorship and democracy, it is better
to prefer democracy as it has several
other positive outcomes.

Arguments about democracy tend to Poor Kids
be very passionate. This is how it
should be, for democracy appeals to
some of our deep values. These
debates cannot be resolved in a
simple manner. But some debates
about democracy can and should be
resolved by referring to some facts
and figures. The debate about the
economic outcomes of democracy is
one such debate. Over the years
many students of democracy have
gathered careful evidence to see
what the relationship of democracy
with economic growth and economic
inequalities is. The tables and the
cartoon here present some of the evidences:
l Table 1 shows that on an average dictatorial regimes have had a slightly better record
of economic growth. But when we compare their record only in poor countries, there is
virtually no difference.
l Table 2 shows that within democracies there can be very high degree of inequalities. In
democratic countries like South Africa and Brazil, the top 20 per cent people take away
more than 60 per cent of the national income, leaving less than 3 per cent for the bottom
20 per cent population. Countries like Denmark and Hungary are much better in this respect.
l You can see in the cartoon, there is often inequality of opportunities available to the
poorer sections.
What would be your verdict on democracy if you had to base it purely on economic
performance of democratic regimes in terms of growth and equal distribution?

Reduction of inequality and poverty

Voice of the Poor

Democracies are based on political
equality. All individuals have equal weight
in electing representatives. Parallel to the
process of bringing individuals into the
political arena on an equal footing, we
find growing economic inequalities. A
small number of ultra-rich enjoy a highly
disproportionate share of wealth and
incomes. Not only that, their share in the
total income of the country has been
increasing. Those at the bottom of the
society have very little to depend upon.
Their incomes have been declining.
Sometimes they find it difficult to meet
their basic needs of life, such as food,
clothing, house, education and health.
In actual life, democracies do not
appear to be very successful in reducing
economic inequalities. In Class IX
Economics textbook, you have already
studied about poverty in India. The
poor constitute a large proportion
of our voters and no party will
like to lose their votes. Yet
democratically elected
governments do not
appear to be as keen to
address the question of
poverty as you would
expect them to. The
situation is much worse in
some other countries. In
Bangladesh, more than
half of its population lives
in poverty. People in
several poor countries are
now dependent on the rich
countries even for food
supplies.

Democracy is a
rule of the
majority. The
poor are in
majority. So
democracy must
be a rule of the
poor. How can
this not be the
case?

Outcomes of Democracy

Perhaps more than development, it is
reasonable to expect democracies to
reduce economic disparities. Even when
a country achieves economic growth, will
wealth be distributed in such a way that
all citizens of the country will have a
share and lead a better life? Is economic
growth in democracies accompanied by
increased inequalities among the people?
Or do democracies lead to a just
distribution of goods and opportunities?

Democratic Politics

Accommodation of social diversity

All you are saying
is that
democracy
ensures that
people do not
break each
other’s head.
This is not
harmony. Should
we be happy
about it?

Do democracies lead to peaceful and
harmonious life among citizens? It will
be a fair expectation that democracy
should produce a harmonious social life.
We have seen in the earlier chapters how
democracies accommodate various social
divisions. We saw in the first chapter how
Belgium has successfully negotiated
differences among ethnic populations.
Democracies usually develop a procedure
to conduct their competition. This reduces
the possibility of these tensions becoming
explosive or violent.
No society can fully and permanently
resolve conflicts among different groups.
But we can certainly learn to respect these
differences and we can also evolve
mechanisms to negotiate the differences.
Democracy is best suited to produce this
outcome. Non-democratic regimes often
turn a blind eye to or suppress internal

96

2020-21

social differences. Ability to handle social
differences, divisions and conflicts is thus
a definite plus point of democratic
regimes. But the example of Sri Lanka
reminds us that a democracy must fulfil
two conditions in order to achieve this
outcome:
l It is necessary to understand that
democracy is not simply rule by majority
opinion. The majority always needs to
work with the minority so that
governments function to represent the
general view. Majority and minority
opinions are not permanent.
l It is also necessary that rule by
majority does not become rule by
majority community in terms of religion
or race or linguistic group, etc. Rule by
majority means that in case of every
decision or in case of every election,
different persons and groups may and

can form a majority. Democracy remains
democracy only as long as every citizen
has a chance of being in majority at some
point of time. If someone is barred

from being in majority on the basis of
birth, then the democratic rule ceases
to be accommodative for that person
or group.

Enemies

Democracy stands much superior to any
other form of government in
promoting dignity and freedom of the
individual. Every individual wants to
receive respect from fellow beings.
Often conflicts arise among individuals
because some feel that they are not
treated with due respect. The passion for
respect and freedom are the basis of
democracy. Democracies throughout the
world have recognised this, at least in

principle. This has been achieved in
various degrees in various democracies.
For societies which have been built for
long on the basis of subordination and
domination, it is not a simple matter to
recognize that all individuals are equal.
Take the case of dignity of women.
Most societies across the world were
historically male dominated societies.
Long struggles by women have created
some sensitivity today that respect to and

equal treatment of women are necessary
ingredients of a democratic society. That
does not mean that women are actually
always treated with respect. But once the
principle is recognised, it becomes easier
for women to wage a struggle against
what is now unacceptable legally and
morally. In a non-democratic set up, this
unacceptability would not have legal basis
because the principle of individual
freedom and dignity would not have the
legal and moral force there. The same is
true of caste inequalities. Democracy in
India has strengthened the claims of the
disadvantaged and discriminated castes
for equal status and equal opportunity.
There are instances still of caste-based
inequalities and atrocities, but these lack
the moral and legal foundations. Perhaps
it is the recognition that makes ordinary
citizens value their democratic rights.
Expectations from democracy also
function as the criteria for judging any
democratic country. What is most

distinctive about democracy is that its
examination never gets over. As
democracy passes one test, it produces
another test. As people get some benefits
of democracy, they ask for more and
want to make democracy even better.
That is why, when we ask people about
the way democracy functions, they will
always come up with more expectations,
and many complaints. The fact that
people are complaining is itself a
testimony to the success of democracy:
it shows that people have developed
awareness and the ability to expect and
to look critically at power holders and
the high and the mighty. A public
expression of dissatisfaction with
democracy shows the success of the
democratic project: it transforms people
from the status of a subject into that of
a citizen. Most individuals today believe
that their vote makes a difference to the
way the government is run and to their
own self-interest.

Colony, a slum habitation in East Delhi. He lost his ration
card and applied for a duplicate one in January 2004. He
made several rounds to the local Food & Civil Supplies office
for the next three months. But the clerks and officials would
not even look at him, leave alone do his job or bother to tell
him the status of his application. Ultimately, he filed an
application under the Right to Information Act asking for the
daily progress made on his application, names of the
officials, who were supposed to act on his application and
what action would be taken against these officials for their
inaction. Within a week of filing application under the Right to
Information Act, he was visited by an inspector from the
Food Department, who informed him that the card had been
made and he could collect it from the office. When Nannu
went to collect his card next day, he was given a very warm
treatment by the Food & Supply Officer (FSO), who is the
head of a Circle. The FSO offered him tea and requested him
to withdraw his application under the Right to Information,
since his work had already been done.
