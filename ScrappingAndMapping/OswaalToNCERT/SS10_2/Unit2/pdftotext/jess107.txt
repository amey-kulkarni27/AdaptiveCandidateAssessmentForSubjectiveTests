We use different materials and services in our
daily life. Some of these are available in our
immediate surroundings, while other
requirements are met by bringing things from
other places. Goods and services do not move
from supply locales to demand locales on their
own. The movement of these goods and services
from their supply locations to demand locations
necessitates the need for transport. Some people
are engaged in facilitating these movements.
These are known to be traders who make the
products come to the consumers by
transportation. Thus, the pace of development
of a country depends upon the production of
goods and services as well as their movement
over space. Therefore, efficient means of transport
are prerequisites for fast development.
Movement of these goods and services can be
over three important domains of our earth i.e. land,
water and air. Based on these, transport can also
be classified into land, water and air transport.

expanded far and wide. Today, the world has
been converted into a large village with the help
of efficient and fast moving transport.
Transport has been able to achieve this with
the help of equally developed communication
system. Therefore, transport, communication
and trade are complementary to each other.
Today, India is well-linked with the rest of
the world despite its vast size, diversity and
linguistic and socio-cultural plurality.
Railways, airways, waterways, newspapers,
radio, television, cinema and internet, etc. have
been contributing to its socio-economic
progress in many ways. The trades from local
to international levels have added to the vitality
of its economy. It has enriched our life and
added substantially to growing amenities and
facilities for the comforts of life.
In this chapter, you will see how modern
means of transport and communication serve
as lifelines of our nation and its modern

TRANSPORT
Roadways
India has one of the largest road networks in
the world, aggregating to about 56 lakh km.
In India, roadways have preceded railways.
They still have an edge over railways in view of
the ease with which they can be built and
maintained. The growing importance of road
transport vis-à-vis rail transport is rooted in
the following reasons; (a) construction cost of
roads is much lower than that of railway lines,
(b) roads can traverse comparatively more
dissected and undulating topography, (c) roads
can negotiate higher gradients of slopes and
as such can traverse mountains such as the
Himalayas, (d) road transport is economical in
transportation of few persons and relatively
smaller amount of goods over short distances,
(e) it also provides door-to-door service, thus
the cost of loading and unloading is much
lower, (f) road transport is also used as a feeder
to other modes of transport such as they
provide a link between railway stations, air
and sea ports.
In India, roads are classified in the
following six classes according to their
capacity. Look at the map of the National
Highways and find out about the significant
role played by these roads.
• Golden Quadrilateral Super Highways:
The government has launched a major
road development project linking DelhiKolkata-Chennai-Mumbai and Delhi by
six-lane Super Highways. The NorthSouth corridors linking Srinagar (Jammu
& Kashmir) and Kanniyakumari (Tamil
N a d u ) , a n d E a s t - We s t C o r r i d o r
connecting Silchar (Assam) and Porbander
(Gujarat) are part of this project. The
major objective of these Super Highways
is to reduce the time and distance
between the mega cities of India. These
highway projects are being implemented
by the National Highway Authority of
India (NHAI).
• National Highways: National Highways

laid and maintained by the Central Public
Works Department (CPWD). A number of
major National Highways run in NorthSouth and East-West directions. The
historical Sher-Shah Suri Marg is called
National Highway No.1, between Delhi
and Amritsar.

Find out places linked by the National
Highway 2 and 3.
• State Highways: Roads linking a state
capital with different district headquarters
are known as State Highways. These
roads are constructed and maintained by
the State Public Works Department (PWD)
in State and Union Territories.
• District Roads: These roads connect the
district headquarters with other places
of the district. These roads are maintained
by the Zila Parishad.
• Other Roads: Rural roads, which link rural
areas and villages with towns, are classified
under this category. These roads received
special impetus under the Pradhan Mantri
Grameen Sadak Yojana. Under this scheme
special provisions are made so that every
village in the country is linked to a major
town in the country by an all season
motorable road.
• Border Roads: Apart from these, Border
Roads Organisation a Government of
India undertaking constructs and

maintains roads in the bordering areas
of the country. This organisation was
established in 1960 for the development
of the roads of strategic importance in
the northern and north-eastern border
areas. These roads have improved
accessibility in areas of difficult terrain
and have helped in the economic
development of these area.

Railways
Railways are the principal mode of
transportation for freight and passengers
in India. Railways also make it possible
for people to conduct multifarious
a c t i v i t i e s l i k e b u s i n e s s , s i g h t seei n g ,
pilgrimage along with transportation of
goods over longer distances. Apart from
an important means of transport the
Indian Railways have been a great
integrating force for more than 150 years.
Railways in India bind the economic life
of the country as well as accelerate the
development of the industry and
agriculture.
The Indian Railways is the largest public
sector undertaking in the country. The first
train steamed off from Mumbai to Thane in
1853, covering a distance of 34 km.
The Indian Railway is now reorganised
into 16 zones.

Find out the current Railway zones and their
headquarters. Also locate the headquarters
of Railway zones on the map of India.

Fig. 7.4: Traffic on north-eastern border road
(Arunachal Pradesh)

Roads can also be classified on the basis
of the type of material used for their
construction such as metalled and unmetalled
roads. Metalled roads may be made of cement,
concrete or even bitumen of coal, therefore,
these are all weather roads. Unmetalled roads
go out of use in the rainy season.

The distribution pattern of the Railway
network in the country has been largely
influenced by physiographic, economic and
administrative factors. The northern plains
with their vast level land, high population
density and rich agricultural resources
provided the most favourable condition for their
growth. However, a large number of rivers
requiring construction of bridges across their
wide beds posed some obstacles. In the hilly
terrains of the peninsular region, railway tracts
are laid through low hills, gaps or tunnels.
The Himalayan mountainous regions too are
unfavourable for the construction of railway
lines due to high relief, sparse population and
lack of economic opportunities. Likewise, it was
difficult to lay railway lines on the sandy plain
of western Rajasthan, swamps of Gujarat,
forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh,

contiguous stretch of Sahyadri could be
crossed only through gaps or passes (Ghats).
In recent times, the development of the Konkan
railway along the west coast has facilitated the
movement of passengers and goods in this most
important economic region of India. It has also
faced a number of problem such as sinking of
track in some stretches and landslides.
Today, the railways have become more
important in our national economy than all
other means of transport put together.
However, rail transport suffers from certain
problems as well. Many passengers travel
without tickets. Thefts and damaging of
railway property has not yet stopped
completely. People stop the trains, pull the
chain unnecessarily and this causes heavy
damage to the railway. Think over it, how we
can help our railway in running as per the
scheduled time?

Waterways
Since the ancient period, India was one of
the seafaring countries. Its seamen sailed
far and near, thus, carrying and spreading
Indian commerce and culture. Waterways are
the cheapest means of transport. They are
most suitable for carrying heavy and bulky
goods. It is a fuel-efficient and environment
friendly mode of transport. India has inland
navigation waterways of 14,500 km in length.
Out of these only 5685 km are navigable by
mechanised vessels. The following waterways
have been declared as the National
Waterways by the Government.

Pipeline transport network is a new arrival
on the transportation map of India. In the
past, these were used to transport water to
cities and industries. Now, these are used for
transporting crude oil, petroleum products
and natural gas from oil and natural gas fields
to refineries, fertilizer factories and big thermal
power plants. Solids can also be transported
through a pipeline when converted into slurry.
The far inland locations of refineries like
Barauni, Mathura, Panipat and gas based
fertilizer plants could be thought of only

Apart from these, India’s trade with foreign
countries is carried from the ports located
along the coast. 95 per cent of the country’s
trade volume (68 per cent in terms of value)
is moved by sea.

Ever since humans appeared on the earth,
they have used different means of
communication. But, the pace of change, has
been rapid in modern times. Long distance
communication is far easier without physical
movement of the communicator or receiver.
Personal communication and mass
communication including television, radio,
press, films, etc. are the major means of
communication in the country. The Indian
postal network is the largest in the world. It
handles parcels as well as personal written
communications. Cards and envelopes are
considered first-class mail and are airlifted
between stations covering both land and air.
The second-class mail includes book packets,
registered newspapers and periodicals. They
are carried by surface mail, covering land and
water transport. To facilitate quick delivery
of mails in large towns and cities, six mail
channels have been introduced recently. They
are called Rajdhani Channel, Metro Channel,
Green Channel, Business Channel, Bulk Mail
Channel and Periodical Channel.

The exchange of goods among people, states
and countries is referred to as trade. The
market is the place where such exchanges
take place. Trade between two countries is
called international trade. It may take place
through sea, air or land routes. While local
trade is carried in cities, towns and villages,
state level trade is carried between two or more
states. Advancement of international trade of
a country is an index to its economic
prosperity. It is, therefore, considered the
economic barometer for a country.
As the resources are space bound, no
country can survive without international
trade. Export and import are the components
of trade. The balance of trade of a country is
the difference between its export and import.
When the value of export exceeds the value
of imports, it is called a favourable balance
of trade. On the contrary, if the value of
imports exceeds the value of exports, it is
termed as unfavourable balance of trade.
India has trade relations with all the major
trading blocks and all geographical regions
of the world. The commodities exported from
India to other countries include gems and
jewellery, chemicals and related products,
agriculture and allied products, etc.

The commodities imported to India
include petroleum crude and products,
gems and jewellery, chemicals and related
products, base metals, electronic items,
machinery, agriculture and allied products.
India has emerged as a software giant at the
international level and it is earning large
foreign exchange through the export of
information technology.
Tourism as a Trade
Tourism in India has grown substantially over
the last three decades.
More than 15 million people are directly
engaged in the tourism industry. Tourism also
promotes national integration, provides
support to local handicrafts and cultural
pursuits. It also helps in the development of
international understanding about our
culture and heritage. Foreign tourists visit
India for heritage tourism, eco tourism,

adventure tourism, cultural tourism, medical
tourism and business tourism.
There is a vast potential for development of
tourism in all parts of the country. Efforts are
being made to promote different types of
tourism for this upcoming industry.
