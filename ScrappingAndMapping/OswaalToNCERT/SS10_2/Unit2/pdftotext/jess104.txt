India is an agriculturally important country.
Two-thirds of its population is engaged in
agricultural activities. Agriculture is a primary
activity, which produces most of the food that
we consume. Besides food grains, it also
produces raw material for various industries.
Can you name some industries based on
agricultural raw material?

Moreover, some agricultural products like
tea, coffee, spices, etc. are also exported.

TYPES OF FARMING
Agriculture is an age-old economic activity in
our country. Over these years, cultivation
methods have changed significantly depending
upon the characteristics of physical
environment, technological know-how and
socio-cultural practices. Farming varies from
subsistence to commercial type. At present,
in different parts of India, the following
farming systems are practised.
Primitive Subsistence Farming
This type of farming is still practised in few
pockets of India. Primitive subsistence
agriculture is practised on small patches of
land with the help of primitive tools like hoe,
dao and digging sticks, and family/
community labour. This type of farming
depends upon monsoon, natural fertility of
the soil and suitability of other environmental
conditions to the crops grown.
It is a ‘slash and burn’ agriculture.
Farmers clear a patch of land and produce
cereals and other food crops to sustain their
family. When the soil fertility decreases, the
farmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land
for cultivation. This type of shifting allows
Nature to replenish the fertility of the soil

through natural processes; land productivity
in this type of agriculture is low as the farmer
does not use fertilisers or other modern
inputs. It is known by different names in
different parts of the country.
Can you name some such types of farmings?

It is jhumming in north-eastern states like
Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland;
Pamlou in Manipur, Dipa in Bastar district
of Chhattishgarh, and in A ndaman and
Nicobar Islands.
Jhumming: The ‘slash and burn’ agriculture
is known as ‘Milpa’ in Mexico and Central
America, ‘Conuco’ in Venzuela, ‘Roca’ in
Brazil, ‘Masole’ in Central Africa, ‘Ladang’
in Indonesia, ‘Ray’ in Vietnam.
In India, this primitive form of cultivation
is called ‘Bewar’ or ‘Dahiya’ in Madhya
Pradesh, ‘Podu’ or ‘Penda’ in Andhra Pradesh,
‘Pama Dabi’ or ‘Koman’ or Bringa’ in Odisha,
‘Kumari’ in Western Ghats, ‘Valre’ or ‘Waltre’
in South-eastern Rajasthan, ‘Khil’ in the
Himalayan belt, ‘Kuruwa’ in Jharkhand, and
‘Jhumming’ in the North-eastern region.

Rinjha lived with her family in a small village
at the outskirts of Diphu in Assam. She enjoys
watching her family members clearing,
slashing and burning a patch of land for
cultivation. She often helps them in irrigating
the fields with water running through a
bamboo canal from the nearby spring. She
loves the surroundings and wants to stay
here as long as she can, but this little girl
has no idea about the declining fertility of
the soil and her family’s search for fresh a
patch of land in the next season.

Can you name the type of farming Rinjha’s
family is engaged in?
Can you enlist some crops which are grown
in such farming?

Intensive Subsistence Farming
This type of farming is practised in areas of
high population pressure on land. It is labourintensive farming, where high doses of
biochemical inputs and irrigation are used
for obtaining higher production.

Plantation is also a type of commercial
farming. In this type of farming, a single crop
is grown on a large area. The plantation has
an interface of agriculture and industry.
Plantations cover large tracts of land, using
capital intensive inputs, with the help of
migrant labourers. All the produce is used
as raw material in respective industries.
In India, tea, coffee, rubber, sugarcane,
banana, etc., are important plantation crops.
Tea in Assam and North Bengal coffee in
K arnataka are some of the important
plantation crops grown in these states. Since
the production is mainly for market, a welldeveloped network of transport and
communication connecting the plantation
areas, processing industries and markets
plays an important role in the development
of plantations.

Can you name some of the states of India
where such farming is practised?

Though the ‘right of inheritance’ leading
to the division of land among successive
generations has rendered land-holding size
uneconomical, the farmers continue to take
maximum output from the limited land in
the absence of alternative source of livelihood.
Thus, there is enormous pressure on
agricultural land.

Fig. 4.2: Banana plantation in Southern
part of India

Commercial Farming
The main characteristic of this type of farming
is the use of higher doses of modern inputs,
e.g. high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, chemical
fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides in order
to obtain higher productivity. The degree of
commercialisation of agriculture varies from
one region to another. For example, rice is a
commercial crop in Haryana and Punjab, but
in Odisha, it is a subsistence crop.
Can you give some more examples of crops
which may be commercial in one region and
may provide subsistence in another region?

C ROPPING PATTERN
You have studied the physical diversities and
plurality of cultures in India. These are also
reflected in agricultural practices and
cropping patterns in the country. Various
types of food and fibre crops, vegetables and
fruits, spices and condiments, etc. constitute
some of the important crops grown in the
country. India has three cropping seasons
— rabi, kharif and zaid.
Rabi crops are sown in winter from October
to December and harvested in summer from
April to June. Some of the important rabi
crops are wheat, barley, peas, gram and
mustard. Though, these crops are grown in
large parts of India, states from the north
and north-western parts such as Punjab,
Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and
Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are
important for the production of wheat and
other rabi crops. Availability of precipitation
during winter months due to the western
temperate cyclones helps in the success of
these crops. However, the success of the green
revolution in Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar
Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan has also been
an important factor in the growth of the abovementioned rabi crops.
K harif crops are grown with the onset of
monsoon in different parts of the country and
these are harvested in September-October.
Important crops grown during this season
are paddy, maize, jowar, bajra, tur (arhar),
moong, urad, cotton, jute, groundnut and
soyabean. Some of the most important ricegrowing regions are Assam, West Bengal,
coastal regions of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh,
Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and
Maharashtra, particularly the (Konkan coast)
along with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Recently,
paddy has also become an important crop of
Punjab and Haryana. In states like Assam,
West Bengal and Odisha, three crops of paddy
are grown in a year. These are Aus, Aman
and Boro.
In between the rabi and the kharif seasons,
there is a short season during the summer
months known as the Zaid season. Some of
the crops produced during ‘zaid’ are
36

watermelon, muskmelon, cucumber,
vegetables and fodder crops. Sugarcane takes
almost a year to grow.
Major Crops
A variety of food and non food crops are
grown in dif ferent parts of the country
depending upon the variations in soil, climate
and cultivation practices. Major crops grown
in India are rice, wheat, millets, pulses, tea,
coffee, sugarcane, oil seeds, cotton and jute,
etc.
Rice: It is the staple food crop of a majority of
the people in India. Our country is the second
largest producer of rice in the world after
China. It is a kharif crop which requires high
temperature, (above 25°C) and high humidity
with annual rainfall above 100 cm. In the areas
of less rainfall, it grows with the help of
irrigation.

Rice is grown in the plains of north and
north-eastern India, coastal areas and the
deltaic regions. Development of dense network
of canal irrigation and tubewells have made
it possible to grow rice in areas of less rainfall
such as Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar
Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan.
Wheat: This is the second most important
cereal crop. It is the main food crop, in north
and north-western part of the country. This
rabi crop requires a cool growing season and
a bright sunshine at the time of ripening. It
requires 50 to 75 cm of annual rainfall evenlydistributed over the growing season. There
are two important wheat-growing zones in the
country – the Ganga-Satluj plains in the
north-west and black soil region of the Deccan.
The major wheat-producing states are
Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya
Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan.

Fig. 4.6: Bajra Cultivation

Bajra grows well on sandy soils and
shallow black soil. Major Bajra producing
States are Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh,
Maharashtra, Gujarat and Haryana. Ragi is
a crop of dry regions and grows well on red,
black, sandy, loamy and shallow black soils.
Major ragi producing states are: Karnataka,
Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand,
Sikkim, Jharkhand and Arunachal Pradesh.
Maize: It is a crop which is used both as
food and fodder. It is a kharif crop which
requires temperature between 21°C to 27°C
and grows well in old alluvial soil. In some
states like Bihar maize is grown in rabi season
also. Use of modern inputs such as HYV
seeds, fertilisers and irrigation have
contributed to the increasing production of
maize. Major maize-producing states are
Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh,
Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

Fig. 4.5: Wheat Cultivation

Millets: Jowar, bajra and ragi are the
important millets grown in India. Though,
these are known as coarse grains, they have
very high nutritional value. For example, ragi
is very rich in iron, calcium, other micro
nutrients and roughage. Jowar is the third
most important food crop with respect to area
and production. It is a rain-fed crop mostly
grown in the moist areas which hardly needs
irrigation. Major Jowar producing States are
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh
and Madhya Pradesh.

Pulses: India is the largest producer as well
as the consumer of pulses in the world. These
are the major source of protein in a vegetarian
diet. Major pulses that are grown in India are
tur (arhar), urad, moong, masur, peas and
gram. Can you distinguish which of these
pulses are grown in the kharif season and
which are grown in the rabi season? Pulses
need less moisture and survive even in dry
conditions. Being leguminous crops, all these
crops except arhar help in restoring soil
fertility by fixing nitrogen from the air.
Therefore, these are mostly grown in rotation
with other crops. Major pulse producing states
in India are Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,
Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka.
Food Crops other than Grains
Sugarcane: It is a tropical as well as a
subtropical crop. It grows well in hot and
humid climate with a temperature of 21°C to
27°C and an annual rainfall between 75cm.
and 100cm. Irrigation is required in the
regions of low rainfall. It can be grown on a
variety of soils and needs manual labour from

sowing to harvesting. India is the second
largest producer of sugarcane only after
Brazil. It is the main source of sugar, gur
(jaggary), khandsari and molasses. The major
sugarcane-producing states are Uttar Pradesh,
Maharashtra, Kar nataka, Tamil Nadu,
Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, Punjab
and Haryana.
Oil Seeds: In 2016 India was the second
largest producer of groundnut in the world
after china. In rapeseed production India was
third largest producer in the world after
Canada and China in 2016. Different oil seeds
are grown covering approximately 12 per cent
of the total cropped area of the country. Main
oil-seeds produced in India are groundnut,
mustard, coconut, sesamum (til), soyabean,
castor seeds, cotton seeds, linseed and
sunflower. Most of these are edible and used
as cooking mediums. However, some of these
are also used as raw material in the
production of soap, cosmetics and ointments.
Groundnut is a kharif crop and accounts
for about half of the major oilseeds produced
in the country. Gujarat was the largest producer
of groundnut followed by Rajasthan and Andhra
Pradesh in 2016–17. Linseed and mustard are
rabi crops. Sesamum is a kharif crop in north
and rabi crop in south India. Castor seed is
grown both as rabi and kharif crop.
Tea: Tea cultivation is an example of
plantation agriculture. It is also an important
beverage crop introduced in India initially by
the British. Today, most of the tea plantations
are owned by Indians. The tea plant grows
well in tropical and sub-tropical climates
endowed with deep and fertile well-drained
soil, rich in humus and organic matter. Tea
bushes require warm and moist frost-free

its freshness. Major teaproducing states are Assam, hills of Darjeeling
and Jalpaiguri districts, West Bengal, Tamil
Nadu and Kerala. Apart from these, Himachal
Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Meghalaya, Andhra
Pradesh and Tripura are also tea-producing
states in the country. In 2016 India was the
second largest producer of tea after China.
Coffee: Indian coffee is known in the world
for its good quality. The Arabica variety
initially brought from Yemen is produced in
the country. This variety is in great demand
all over the world. Initially its cultivation was
introduced on the Baba Budan Hills and even
today its cultivation is confined to the Nilgiri
in Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

India is an important producer of pea,
cauliflower, onion, cabbage, tomato, brinjal
and potato.
Non-Food Crops
Rubber: It is an equatorial crop, but under
special conditions, it is also grown in tropical
and sub-tropical areas. It requires moist and
humid climate with rainfall of more than 200
cm. and temperature above 25°C.
Rubber is an important industrial raw
material. It is mainly grown in Kerala, Tamil
Nadu, Karnataka and Andaman and Nicobar
islands and Garo hills of Meghalaya.
List the items which are made of rubber and
are used by us.
Fibre Crops: Cotton, jute, hemp and natural
silk are the four major fibre crops grown in
India. The first three are derived from the crops
grown in the soil, the latter is obtained from
cocoons of the silkworms fed on green leaves
specially mulberry. Rearing of silk worms for
the production of silk fibre is known as
sericulture.
Cotton: India is believed to be the original
home of the cotton plant. Cotton is one of
the main raw materials for cotton textile
industry. In 2016, India was second largest
producer of cotton after China. Cotton grows
well in drier parts of the black cotton soil of
the Deccan plateau. It requires high
temperature, light rainfall or irrigation, 210
frost-free days and bright sun-shine for its

growth. It is a kharif crop and requires 6 to
8 months to mature. Major cotton-producing
states are– Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya
Pradesh, Kar nataka, Andhra Pradesh,
Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana and
Uttar Pradesh.
Jute: It is known as the golden fibre. Jute
grows well on well-drained fertile soils in the
flood plains where soils are renewed every
year. High temperature is required during the
time of growth. West Bengal, Bihar, Assam,
Odisha and Meghalaya are the major jute
producing states. It is used in making gunny
bags, mats, ropes, yarn, carpets and other
artefacts. Due to its high cost, it is losing
market to synthetic fibres and packing
materials, particularly the nylon.
Technological and Institutional Reforms
It was mentioned in the previous pages that
agriculture has been practised in India for
thousands of years. Sustained uses of land
without compatible techno-institutional
changes have hindered the pace of
agricultural development. Inspite of
development of sources of irrigation most of
the farmers in large parts of the country still
depend upon monsoon and natural fertility
in order to carry on their agriculture. For a
growing population, this poses a serious
challenge. Agriculture which provides
livelihood for more than 60 per cent of its
population, needs some serious technical and
institutional reforms. Thus, collectivisation,
consolidation of holdings, cooperation and
abolition of zamindari, etc. were given priority
to bring about institutional reforms in the
country after Independence. ‘Land reform’
was the main focus of our First Five Year
Plan. The right of inheritance had already
lead to fragmentation of land holdings
necessitating consolidation of holdings.
The laws of land reforms were enacted
but the implementation was lacking or
lukewarm. The Government of India
embarked upon introducing agricultural
reforms to improve Indian agriculture in the
1960s and 1970s. The Green Revolution
based on the use of package technology and
the White Revolution (Operation Flood) were

Fig. 4.15: Modern technological equipments used in agriculture

some of the strategies initiated to improve
the lot of Indian agriculture. But, this too led
to the concentration of development in few
selected areas. Therefore, in the 1980s and
1990s, a comprehensive land development
programme was initiated, which included
both institutional and technical reforms.
Provision for crop insurance against drought,
flood, cyclone, fire and disease, establishment
of Grameen banks, cooperative societies and
banks for providing loan facilities to the
farmers at lower rates of interest were some
important steps in this direction.
K issan Credit Card (KCC), Personal
Accident Insurance Scheme (PAIS) are some
other schemes introduced by the Government
of India for the benefit of the farmers.
Moreover, special weather bulletins and
agricultural programmes for farmers were
introduced on the radio and television. The
government also announces minimum
support price, remunerative and procurement
prices for important crops to check the
exploitation of farmers by speculators and
middlemen.

undertook padyatra to spread Gandhiji’s
message covered almost the entire country.
Once, when he was delivering a lecture at
Pochampalli in Andhra Pradesh, some poor
landless villagers demanded some land for
their economic well-being. Vinoba Bhave
could not promise it to them immediately but
assured them to talk to the Government of
India regarding provision of land for them if
they undertook cooperative farming.
Suddenly, Shri Ram Chandra Reddy stood
up and offered 80 acres of land to be
distributed among 80 land-less villagers.
This act was known as ‘Bhoodan’. Later he
travelled and introduced his ideas widely all
over India. Some zamindars, owners of
many villages offered to distribute some
villages among the landless. It was known
as Gramdan. However, many land-owners
chose to provide some part of their land to
the poor farmers due to the fear of land
ceiling act. This Bhoodan- Gramdan
movement initiated by Vinoba Bhave is also
known as the Blood-less Revolution.

Bhoodan – Gramdan
Mahatma Gandhi declared Vinoba Bhave as
his spiritual heir. He also participated in
Satyagraha as one of the foremost
satyagrahis. He was one of the votaries of
Gandhi’s concept of gram swarajya. After
Gandhiji’s martyrdom, Vinoba Bhave

Contribution of agriculture to the national
economy, employment and output

Indian economy though its share in the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) has registered a
declining trend from 1951 onwards; in

force was employed by the farm sector which
makes more than half of the Indian Population
dependent on agriculture for sustenance.
The declining share of agriculture in the
GDP is a matter of serious concern because
any decline and stagnation in agriculture will
lead to a decline in other spheres of the
economy having wider implications for society.
Considering the importance of agriculture
in India, the Government of India made
concerted efforts to modernise agriculture.
Establishment of Indian Council of
Agricultural Research (ICAR), agricultural
universities, veterinary services and animal
breeding centres, horticulture development,
research and development in the field of
meteorology and weather forecast, etc. were
given priority for improving Indian agriculture.
Apart from this, improving the rural
infrastructure was also considered essential
for the same.
Find out why an Indian farmer does not want
his son to become a farmer.
From the Table 4.1, it is clear that though
the GDP growth rate is increasing over the
years, it is not generating suf ficient
employment opportunities in the country. The
growth rate in agriculture has been
decelerating which is an alarming situation.
Today, Indian farmers are facing a big
challenge from international competition and
reduction in the public investment in

agriculture sector. Subsidy on fertilisers is
decreased leading to increase in the cost of
production. Moreover, reduction in import
duties on agricultural products have proved
detrimental to agriculture in the country.
Farmers are withdrawing their investment
from agriculture causing a downfall in the
employment in agriculture.
When farmers have been facing so many
problems and land under agriculture is
decreasing, can we think of alternative
employment opportunities in the agriculture
sector?
Why are farmers committing suicides in several
states of the country?

Impact of Globalisation on Agriculture
Globalisation is not a new phenomenon. It
was there at the time of colonisation. In the
nineteenth century when European traders
came to India, at that time too, Indian spices
were exported to different countries of the
world and farmers of south India were
encouraged to grow these crops. Till today it
is one of the important items of export from
India.
During the British period cotton belts of
India attracted the British and ultimately
cotton was exported to Britain as a raw
material for their textile industries. Cotton
textile industry in Manchester and Liverpool
flourished due to the availability of good
quality cotton from India. You have read about
the Champaran movement which started in
1917 in Bihar. This was started because
farmers of that region were forced to grow
indigo on their land because it was necessary
for the textile industries which were located
in Britain. They were unable to grow
foodgrains to sustain their families.
Under globalisation, particularly after
1990, the farmers in India have been exposed
to new challenges. Despite being an important
producer of rice, cotton, rubber, tea, coffee,
jute and spices our agricultural products are
not able to compete with the developed

controversies. It is being alleged that it has
caused land degradation due to overuse of
chemicals, drying aquifers and vanishing
biodiversity. The keyword today is “gene
revolution”, which includes genetic
engineering.
Genetic engineering is recognised as a
powerful supplement in inventing new
hybrid varieties of seeds.

Fig. 4.16: Tissue culture of teak clones

Today, Indian agriculture finds itself at the
crossroads. To make agriculture successful and
profitable, proper thrust should be given to
the improvement of the condition of marginal
and small farmers. The green revolution
promised much. But today it’s under

and smaller as the population rises. India’s
rural population is about 833 million (2011)
which depends upon 250 million
(approximate) hectares of agricultural land,
an average of less than half a hectare per
person.
Indian farmers should diversify their
cropping pattern from cereals to high-value
crops. This will increase incomes and
reduce environmental degradation
simultaneously. Because fruits, medicinal
herbs, flowers, vegetables, bio-diesel crops
like jatropha and jojoba need much less
irrigation than rice or sugarcane. India’s
diverse climate can be harnessed to grow a
wide range of high-value crops.

Fig. 4.17 Problems associated with heavy pesticide
use are widely recognised in developed and
developing countries

A few economists think that Indian farmers
have a bleak future if they continue growing
foodgrains on the holdings that grow smaller

Change in cropping pattern for example from cereals to high-value crops will mean that India
will have to import food. During 1960’s this would have been seen as a disaster. But if India
imports cereals while exporting high-value commodities, it will be following successful economies
like Italy, Israel and Chile. These countries exports farm products (fruits, olives, speciality seeds
and wine) and import cereals. Are we ready to take this risk? Debate the issue.
