0,Q. 1. Which are the two main minerals used to obtain nuclear energy. Name any two states where these minerals are found. ,"Ans. Nuclear or Atomic Energy is obtained by altering the structure of atoms. When such an alternation is made, much energy is released in the form of heat and this is used to generate electric power. 2  Uranium and Thorium.  Jharkhand and Rajasthan. "
1,Q. 2. What are the two main ways of generating electricity ? How are they different from each other ? Explain. ,"Ans. S.No. Thermal Electricty Hydro Electricity  It is obtained by using coal, petroleum and natural gas. It is produced from water.  It is a non-renewable resource. It is a renewable.  It causes pollution. It does not cause pollution.  It is expensive in the long run. It is cheaper in the long run."
2,Q. 3. Explain any three values which inspire us to conserve our energy resources. ,Ans. Values :  Our responsible behaviour will lead us to conserve energy resources.  Our sustainable thinking which inspires us to preserve and protect the resources for the future generation.  Our consciousness towards our environment will inspire not to over-utilize the resources and exploit them.  3
3,Q. 4. Why is energy required for all activites ? How can energy be generated ? ,"Ans.  Energy is a basic requirement for economic development.  Every sector of the national economy needs input of energy.  Consumption of energy in all forms has been steadily rising all over the country.  Rising prices of oil and gas and their potential shortage have raised uncertainties about the security of energy supply in future. Thermal energy can be obtained by using coal, petroleum and natural gas while hydro-electricity can be produced from water. "
4,Q. 5. Describe any three importance of coal as a source of energy. ,Ans. Importance of coal as a source of energy in India are :  Coal is the most abundantly available fossil fuel in India.  It provides a substantial part of the nation’s energy needs.  It is used for power generation.  It supplies energy to industry as well as for domestic needs.  1 × 3 = 3 
5,Q. 6. Why is it essential to use renewable sources of energy ? ,"Ans.  Non-renewable sources are going to exhaust such as coal, petrol, natural gas. They can cause environmental pollution, therefore, we have to use renewable resources.  India has abundance of solar energy, wind, water, and biomass.  Rising prices of oil and gas and their shortage have raised uncertainties about energy resources in the future."
6,Q. 7. What efforts are required to use mineral resources in a planned and sustainable manner ? Explain in three points. ,"Ans. Following efforts have to be made to use mineral in a planned and sustainable manner :  Recycling of metals : We should recycle the metal or metal-made products to prevent its scarcity. For example : Used steel blade should be sent for recycling, so that the steel can be used again for other purposes.   Improved technologies need to be evolved : Traditional technologies should be replaced with new and improved technologies, so that the wastages can be minimised.  Use of substitute or alternative resources : The resources which cannot be recycled or reused should be replaced with the recyclable resources. e.g. Use of green gas instead of coal for cooking purpose.  3"
7,Q. 8. ‘India is presently one of the least energy efficient countries in the world. We have to adopt cautious approaches for the judicious use of our limited energy resources.” Analyse this statement.  		Explain any three steps to be taken to conserve the energy resources.  		How can we save our limited energy sources ? Suggest any three ways for its judicious use.,"Ans. The statement is right to a great extent. Therefore, we need to adopt a cautious approach for the judicious use of energy resources.  Use public transport system.  Switch off electricity when not needed.  Use power saving devices.  Use non-conventional sources of energy.  3"
