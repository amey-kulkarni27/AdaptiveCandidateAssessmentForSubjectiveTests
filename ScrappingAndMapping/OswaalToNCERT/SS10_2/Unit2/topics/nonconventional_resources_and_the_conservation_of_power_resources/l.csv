“Conservation of minerals is the need of the hour” support the statement with five facts. 		,"Conservation of minerals is the need of the hour :  Minerals are considered to be the backbone of the economy.  Industry and agriculture depend on mineral deposits.  The substances manufactured from them also depend on mineral deposits.  Total volume of workable mineral deposits is very less-only 1% of the earth’s crust.  Mineral resources are being consumed rapidly, and minerals require millions of years to be created and concentrated.  The geological processes of mineral formation are so slow that the rates of replenishment are infinitely small in comparison to the present rates of consumption.  Minerals resources are finite and non-renewable.  The rich mineral deposits of our country are extremely valuable but short-lived possessions.   5"
