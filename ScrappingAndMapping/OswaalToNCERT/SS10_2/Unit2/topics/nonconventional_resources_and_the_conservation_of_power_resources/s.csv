0,"Q. 1. There is an urgent need to develop a sustainable path of energy development. Give two broad measures for it. As concerned citizens, how can you help to conserve energy ? ",Ans. Twin planks/measures :  Promotion of energy conservation.  Increased use of renewable energy sources. As concerned citizens we can do our bit by :  Using public transport systems instead of individual vehicles.  Switching off electricity when not in use.  Using power–saving devices.   Using non-conventional sources of energy.  2+ ½ × 2 = 3 
1,Q. 2. How is geo-thermal energy produced? Explain. ,"Ans. The earth grows progressively hotter with increasing depth. Where the geothermal gradient is high, high temperatures are found at shallow depths. Groundwater in such areas absorbs heat from the rocks and becomes hot. It is so hot that when it rises to the earth’s surface, it turns into steam. This steam is used to drive turbines and generate electricity.  3"
2,Q. 3. How can solar energy solve the energy problem to some extent in India ? Give your opinion.  		Why is solar energy fastly becoming popular in rural and remote areas of India ? Explain. ,"Ans.  India is a tropical country, therefore it receives sunlight in abundance throughout the year.  Solar plant can be easily established in rural and remote areas.  It will minimise the dependence of rural households, firewood and dung cakes which in turn will contribute to environmental conservation and adequate quantity of manure. "
3,Q. 4. “Natural gas is considered an environment– friendly fuel.” Explain the statement in two points. ,Ans.  Natural gas is used as a source of energy as well as an industrial raw material.  It can be transported easily through pipelines.  Pipelines have helped in setting up fertilizer plants and power plants on its way.  Natural gas is a clean source of energy.  It is an environment–friendly fuel because of the low carbon emission.  1 × 3 = 3 
4,Q. 5. Which are the potential sources of biogas ? State any four benefits of biogas. ,"Ans. Potential sources of biogas are : Shrubs, farm wastes, animal and human waste, etc. Four benefits of biogas are :  Its calorific value is high.  It burns without smoke, causing no pollution.  It is the cheapest gaseous fuel.  Its plants provide twin benefits to the farmer in the form of energy and improved quality of manure. "
5,Q. 6. Describe any three non-conventional sources of energy. ,"Ans. Non-conventional sources of energy are :  Solar Energy : India is a tropical country. It has enormous possibilities of trapping solar energy. Photovoltaic technology converts sunlight directly into electricity. Solar energy is fastly becoming popular in rural and remote areas.  Wind Energy : India now ranks as a ‘wind super power’ in the world. The largest wind farm cluster is located in Tamil Nadu from Nagercoil to Madurai. Apart from these, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Kerala, Maharashtra and Lakshadweep have important wind farms. Nagercoil and Jaisalmer are well-known for effective use of wind energy in the country.  Biogas : Shrubs, farm waste, animal and human waste are used to produce biogas for domestic consumption in rural areas. Biogas plants using cattle dung are known as ‘Gobar Gas Plants’ in rural India. These provide twin benefits to the farmer in the form of energy and improved quality of manure."
6,Q. 7. “India should harness the geothermal energy to meet the growing consumption of energy.” Explain the statement in three points. ,"Ans. Geothermal energy :  Geothermal energy exists because the earth grows progressively hotter with the increasing depth.  Where the geothermal gradient is high, high temperatures are found at shallow depths.  Ground water absorbs heat and rises to the earth’s surface into steam.  This could be used to drive turbines and generate electricity.  Potential to produce geothermal energy in India is in Manikaran and Puga Valley.  1 × 3 = 3 "
7,Q. 8. ‘Energy saved is energy produced’. Justify the statement by giving any six measures to conserve the energy resources. ,"Ans.  Use public transport systems instead of individual vehicles.  Switching off electricity when it is not in use.  Using power saving devices.  Using non-conventional sources of energy.  Use of power saving electrical appliances.  Minimum use of high power consuming electrical gadgets i.e., Air conditioner, room heaters etc."
8,Q. 9. Why do we need to conserve energy resources ? Write two ways to conserve energy resources ? ,Ans. Energy needs of the country is tremendously increasing with the growth of economy. It is therefore needed to conserve energy resources. The two ways to conserve energy resources are as follows :  Promotion of energy conservation.  Increased use of renewable energy sources.  3
9,Q. 10. Explain three phases by which treatment of industrial effluents can be done? ,"Ans.  Primary treatment by mechanical means. This involves screening, grinding flocculation and sedimentation.  Secondary treatment by biological process.  Tertiary treatment by biological chemical and physical processes. This involves recyling of waste water.  3"
