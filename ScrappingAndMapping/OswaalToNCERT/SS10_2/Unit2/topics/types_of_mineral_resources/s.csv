How is mining activity hazardous ? Explain.  How is the mining activity injurious to the health of the miners and environment ? Explain.  		“Mining affects health and environment both.“ Comment. ,"The mining activity is injurious to the health of the miners and environment as :  The dust and noxious fumes inhaled by miners make them vulnerable to pulmonary diseases.  The risk of collapsing mine roofs.  Inundation and fires in coalmines are a constant threat to miners.  The water sources in the region get contaminated due to mining.   Dumping of waste and slurry leads to degradation of land, soil and increase in stream and river pollution. "
Describe any three features of ferrous minerals found in India.,Features of Ferrous Minerals are :  Ferrous minerals account for about three fourth of the total values of the production of metallic minerals.  They provide a strong base for the development of metallurgical industries.  India exports substantial quantities of minerals after meeting her internal demands.  Iron ore and manganese are the major ferrous minerals.  1 × 3 = 3 
Define metallic and non-metallic minerals and give one example of each. ,"Metallic minerals are those minerals that can be melted to obtain new products. Example : iron, copper. Non-metallic minerals are those minerals which do not yield new products on melting. Example : coal, salt. "
Name the non-metallic mineral which can split easily into thin sheets. Mention its uses. ,Mica is the non-metallic mineral which can be split easily into thin sheets. Mica is used in : Electric and Electronic Industries : Mica is used in these industries due to its excellent di-electric strength. Plastic industry uses mica as an extender and filler.
Why is conservation of minerals important ? How can we conserve minerals ? ,Conservation of minerals is important for the following reasons :  Minerals are exhaustible.  They are limited.  Minerals have manifold uses.  Growth of industrialisation has accelerated the extraction of minerals. We can conserve minerals by making an efficient use of them and using recyclable sources of energy wherever possible.  2 + 1 = 3 
Define the term mineral. Give one example of each of ferrous and non-ferrous minerals. ,"Definition of Mineral : Mineral is a homogeneous, naturally occurring substance with a definable internal structure. Examples of ferrous minerals : Iron ore, manganese, nickel, cobalt, etc. Examples of non-ferrous minerals : copper, lead, tin, etc. "
How does mining degrade environment ? Explain with three examples. ,Hazards of Mining are :  Dust and noxious fumes cause pulmonary diseases.  Risk of collapsing mine roof.  Inundation and fire in coalmine.  Contamination of water sources.  Degradation of land and soil.  Increase in stream and river pollution. ½ × 6 = 3
What is a mineral ? Mention two types of formations in which they occur. ," Geologists define minerals as ‘homogeneous, naturally occurring substance with a definable internal structure’.  Types of formations :  In igneous and metamorphic rocks, the minerals occur as veins and lodes, e.g., tin, copper and zinc.  In sedimentary rocks, they occur in beds or layers, e.g., gypsum, sodium salt, potash salt.  Residual mass of weathered material formed when surface rocks decompose and soluble constituents are removed.  As alluvial deposits/ placer deposits in sands of valley floors and base of hills.  In ocean waters.  1 + 2 = 3"
Explain three factors that make mineral extractions commercially viable., The minerals content of the ore must be in sufficient concentration.  The type of formation or structure in which they are found determines the relative cases with which mineral ores may be mined.  The mineral should be close to the market so that the transportation cost is low.
“Mineral resources in India are unevenly distributed.” Support the statement with three suitable examples. ,"Uneven distribution of mineral resources :  Peninsular rocks contain coal, metallic minerals, mica and many other non-metallic minerals.  Sedimentary rocks on the Western and Eastern Ghats of the Peninsula, in Gujarat and Assam have most of the petroleum deposits.  Rajasthan has reserves of many non-ferrous minerals.  Alluvial plains of North India are devoid of economic minerals.  1 × 3 = 3 "
Differentiate between Ferrous and Non-ferrous minerals. ,"Ferrous Minerals  The minerals containing iron content are known as ferrous minerals.  They are used in iron and steel industry. Non-Ferrous Minerals The minerals which do not contain iron content are known as non-ferrous minerals. They have their own utility and are used in electrical, electronic, chemical industries.  Example : Iron, manga- Example : Copper, lead, aluminium etc. nese, cobalt etc."
What are ‘placer deposits’? Give examples of minerals found in such deposits.," Certain minerals may occur as alluvial deposits in sands of valley floors and base of hills. These deposits are called ‘placer deposits’.  They generally contain minerals which are not corroded by water.  Gold, silver, tin and platinum are examples of some important minerals found in ‘placer deposits’."
What is a mineral ? State giving two examples how minerals are indispensable part of our lives.,"Definition : Homogeneous naturally occurring substances with a definable internal structure. Indispensable because of :  Everyday usage, e.g., household products  Manufacturing industries  Infrastructure.  1 + 2 = 3"
