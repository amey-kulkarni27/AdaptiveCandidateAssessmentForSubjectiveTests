How did the students contribute to national movement in Vietnam ? Explain.," Teachers and students did not follow the curriculum blindly.  While teaching Vietnamese, teachers modified the text and aroused nationalism.  The schools encouraged the students to adopt western styles such as short hair cut, Which was considered to be an attack on Vietnamese culture.  In school textbooks ‘Vietnamese’ were represented as primitive and backward and capable only of manual labour. This aroused hatred against the French and love for the country.  Discrimination in the schools, gave rise to protests and demonstrations."
How were Vietnamese nationalists inspired by Japan and China to set up a democratic republic ? Explain with examples.," Although Vietnam spent more than 1,000 years under Chinese rule, therefore the Chinese did exert a permanent influence on Vietnamese administration, law, education, literature, language and culture.  After independence, Vietnam had major barriers to economic growth like high population.  Low agricultural productivity and extensive indebtedness of the peasants. So, to reduce rural poverty and increase agricultural productivity, it suggested to carry out land reforms as the Japanese had done in 1890’s."
