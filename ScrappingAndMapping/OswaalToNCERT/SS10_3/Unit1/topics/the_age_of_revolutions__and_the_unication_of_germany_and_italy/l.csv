Mazzini believed that God had intended nations to be the natural units of mankind. So, Italy could not continue to be a patchwork of small states and  kingdoms. It had to be forged into a single unified republic within a wider alliance of nations.  This unification alone could be the basis of Italian liberty. Following his model, secret societies were Set-up in Germany, France, Switzerland and Poland.
