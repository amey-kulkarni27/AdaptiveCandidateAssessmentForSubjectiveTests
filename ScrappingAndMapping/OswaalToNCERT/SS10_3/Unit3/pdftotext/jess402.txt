Overview

Federalism

In the previous chapter, we noted that vertical division of power among
different levels of government is one of the major forms of powersharing in modern democracies. In this chapter, we focus on this form
of power-sharing. It is most commonly referred to as federalism. We
begin by describing federalism in general terms. The rest of the chapter
tries to understand the theory and practice of federalism in India. A
discussion of the federal constitutional provisions is followed by an
analysis of the policies and politics that has strengthened federalism in
practice. Towards the end of the chapter, we turn to the local
government, a new and third tier of Indian federalism.

What is federalism?
Let us get back to the contrast between
Belgium and Sri Lanka that we saw in
the last chapter. You would recall that
one of the key changes made in the
Constitution of Belgium was to reduce
the power of the Central Government
and to give these powers to the regional
governments. Regional governments
existed in Belgium even earlier. They
had their roles and powers. But all these
powers were given to these
governments and could be withdrawn
by the Central Government. The
change that took place in 1993 was that
the regional governments were given
constitutional powers that were no
longer dependent on the central
government. Thus, Belgium shifted
from a unitary to a federal form of
government. Sri Lanka continues to be,

I am confused.
What do we call
the Indian
government? Is
it Union, Federal
or Central?

for all practical purposes, a unitary
system where the national government
has all the powers. Tamil leaders want
Sri Lanka to become a federal system.
Federalism is a system of
government in which the power is
divided between a central authority and
various constituent units of the
country. Usually, a federation has two
levels of government. One is the
government for the entire country that
is usually responsible for a few subjects
of common national interest. The
others are governments at the level of
provinces or states that look after
much of the day-to-day administering
of their state. Both these levels of
governments enjoy their power
independent of the other.

Though only 25 of the world’s 193 countries have federal political systems, their citizens make up 40 per cent of the
world’s population. Most of the large countries of the world are federations. Can you notice an exception to this rule
in this map?

14
2020-21

Let us look at some of the key
features of federalism :
1 There are two or more levels (or
tiers) of government.
2 Different tiers of government
govern the same citizens, but each tier
has its own JURISDICTION in specific
matters of legislation, taxation and
administration.
3 The jurisdictions of the respective
levels or tiers of government are
specified in the constitution. So the
existence and authority of each tier of
government is constitutionally
guaranteed.
4 The fundamental provisions of
the constitution cannot be unilaterally
changed by one level of government.
Such changes require the consent of
both the levels of government.
5 Courts have the power to interpret
the constitution and the powers of
different levels of government. The
highest court acts as an umpire if
disputes arise between different levels
of government in the exercise of their
respective powers.
6 Sources of revenue for each level
of government are clearly specified to
ensure its financial autonomy.

7 The federal system thus has dual
objectives: to safeguard and promote
unity of the country, while at the same
time accommodate regional diversity.
Therefore, two aspects are crucial for
the institutions and practice of
federalism. Governments at different
levels should agree to some rules of
power-sharing. They should also trust
that each would abide by its part of
the agreement. An ideal federal system
has both aspects : mutual trust and
agreement to live together.

If federalism
works only in big
countries, why
did Belgium
adopt it?

The exact balance of power
between the central and the state
government varies from one federation
to another. This balance depends
mainly on the historical context in which
the federation was formed. There are
two kinds of routes through which
federations have been formed. The first
route involves independent States
coming together on their own to form
a bigger unit, so that by pooling
sovereignty and retaining identity they
can increase their security. This type of
‘coming together’ federations include
the USA, Switzerland and Australia. In
this first category of federations, all the
constituent States usually have equal
power and are strong vis-à-vis the
federal government.
The second route is where a large
country decides to divide its power
between the constituent States and the
national government. India, Spain and
Belgium are examples of this kind of
‘holding together’ federations. In
this second categor y, the central
government tends to be more powerful
vis-à-vis the States. Very often different
constituent units of the federation have
unequal powers. Some units are
granted special powers.

Jurisdiction: The area
over which someone
has legal authority. The
area may be defined in
terms of geographical
boundaries or in terms
of certain kinds of
subjects.

Federalism

In this sense, federations are
contrasted with unitary governments.
Under the unitary system, either there
is only one level of government or the
sub-units are subordinate to the central
government. The central government
can pass on orders to the provincial or
the local government. But in a federal
system, the central government cannot
order the state government to do
something. State government has
powers of its own for which it is not
answerable to the central government.
Both these governments are separately
answerable to the people.

Some Nepalese citizens were discussing the proposals on the adoption
of federalism in their new constitution. This is what some of them said:
Khag Raj: I don’t like federalism. It would lead to reservation of seats for
different caste groups as in India.
Sarita: Ours in not a very big country. We don’t need federalism.
Babu Lal: I am hopeful that the Terai areas will get more autonomy if they get
their own state government.
Ram Ganesh: I like federalism because it will mean that powers that were earlier
enjoyed by the king will now be exercised by our elected representatives.
If you were participating in this conversation what would be your response to each
of these? Which of these reflect a wrong understanding of what federalism is?

What makes India a federal country?

D e m o c ra t i c Po l i t i c s

We have earlier seen how small
countries like Belgium and Sri Lanka
face so many problems of managing
diversity. What about a vast country like
India, with so many languages, religions
and regions? What are the power
sharing arrangements in our country?
Isn’t that
strange? Did our
constitution
makers not know
about
federalism? Or
did they wish to
avoid talking
about it?

Let us begin with the Constitution.
India had emerged as an independent
nation after a painful and bloody
partition. Soon after Independence,
several princely states became a part of
the country. The Constitution declared
India as a Union of States. Although it
did not use the word federation, the
Indian Union is based on the principles
of federalism.
Let us go back to the seven features
of federalism mentioned above. We can
see that all these features apply to the
provisions of the Indian Constitution.
The Constitution originally provided
for a two-tier system of government,
the Union Government or what we call
the Central Government, representing

16
2020-21

the Union of India and the State
governments. Later, a third tier of
federalism was added in the form of
Panchayats and Municipalities. As in
any federation, these different tiers
enjoy separate jurisdiction. The
Constitution clearly provided a threefold distribution of legislative powers
between the Union Government and
the State Governments. Thus, it
contains three lists:
l Union List includes subjects of
national importance such as defence
of the country, foreign affairs, banking,
communications and currency. They
are included in this list because we need
a uniform policy on these matters
throughout the country. The Union
Government alone can make laws
relating to the subjects mentioned in
the Union List.
l State List contains subjects of
State and local importance such as
police, trade, commerce, agriculture
and irrigation. The State Governments

What about subjects that do not
fall in any of the three lists? Or
subjects like computer software that
came up after the constitution was
made? According to our constitution,
the Union Government has the power
to legislate on these ‘residuary’
subjects.
We noted above that most
federations that are formed by
‘holding together’ do not give equal
power to its constituent units. Thus,
all States in the Indian Union do not
have identical powers. Some States
enjoy a special status. States such as
Assam, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh
and Mizoram enjoy special powers
under certain provisions of the
Constitution of India (Article 371)
due to their peculiar social and
historical circumstances. These special
powers are especially enjoyed in
relation to the protection of land
rights of indigenous peoples, their
culture and also preferential
employment in government services.
Indians who are not permanent
residents of this State cannot buy land
or house here. Similar special

provisions exist for some other States
of India as well.
There are some units of the Indian
Union which enjoy very little power.
These are areas which are too small to
become an independent State but
which could not be merged with any
of the existing States. These areas, like
Chandigarh, or Lakshadweep or the
capital city of Delhi, are called Union
Territories. These territories do not
have the powers of a State. The
Central Government has special
powers in running these areas.
This sharing of power between the
Union Government and the State
governments is basic to the structure
of the Constitution. It is not easy to
make changes to this power sharing
arrangement. The Parliament cannot
on its own change this arrangement.
Any change to it has to be first passed
by both the Houses of Parliament
with at least two-thirds majority. Then
it has to be ratified by the legislatures
of at least half of the total States.
The judiciary plays an important
role in overseeing the implementation
of constitutional provisions and
procedures. In case of any dispute about
the division of powers, the High Courts
and the Supreme Court make a decision.
The Union an d State governments have
the power to raise resources by levying
taxes in order to carry on the
government and the responsibilities
assigned to each of them.

If agriculture and
commerce are
state subjects,
why do we have
ministers of
agriculture and
commerce in the
Union cabinet?

How is federalism practised?

Linguistic States
The creation of linguistic States was the
first and a major test for democratic
politics in our country. If you look at

the political map of India when it
began its journey as a democracy in
1947 and that of 2019, you will be
surprised by the extent of the changes.
Many old States have vanished and
many new States have been created.
Areas, boundaries and names of the
States have been changed.
In 1947, the boundaries of several
old States of India were changed in
order to create new States. This was
done to ensure that people who spoke
the same language lived in the same
State. Some States were created not on
the basis of language but to recognise
differences based on culture, ethnicity
or geography. These include States like
Nagaland, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand.

Federalism

Constitutional provisions are necessary
for the success of federalism but these
are not sufficient. If the federal
experiment has succeeded in India, it
is not merely because of the clearly laid
out constitutional provisions. The real
success of federalism in India can be
attributed to the nature of democratic
politics in our country. This ensured
that the spirit of federalism, respect
for diversity and desire for living
together became shared ideals in our
country. Let us look at some of the
major ways in which this happened.

19
2020-21

When the demand for the
formation of States on the basis of
language was raised, some national
leaders feared that it would lead to the
disintegration of the country. The
Central Government resisted linguistic
States for some time. But the
experience has shown that the
formation of linguistic States has
actually made the country, more united.
It has also made administration easier.

D e m o c ra t i c Po l i t i c s

Coalition government:
A government formed
by the coming together
of at least two political
parties. Usually partners
in a coalition form a
political alliance and
adopt a common
programme.

Centre-State relations

A second test for Indian federation is
the language policy. Our Constitution
did not give the status of national
language to any one language. Hindi was
identified as the official language. But
Hindi is the mother tongue of only
about 40 per cent of Indians. Therefore,
there were many safeguards to protect
other languages. Besides Hindi, there are
21 other languages recognised as
Scheduled Languages by the
Constitution. A candidate in an
examination conducted for the Central
Government positions may opt to take
the examination in any of these
languages. States too have their own
official languages. Much of the
government work takes place in the
official language of the concerned State.

Restr ucturing the Centre-State
relations is one more way in which
federalism has been strengthened in
practice. How the constitutional
arrangements for sharing power work
in reality depends to a large extent on
how the ruling parties and leaders
follow these arrangements. For a long
time, the same party ruled both at the
Centre and in most of the States. This
meant that the State governments did
not exercise their rights as autonomous
federal units. As and when the ruling
party at the State level was different,
the parties that ruled at the Centre tried
to undermine the power of the States.
In those days, the Central Government
would often misuse the Constitution
to dismiss the State governments that
were controlled by rival parties. This
undermined the spirit of federalism.

Unlike Sri Lanka, the leaders of our
country adopted a ver y cautious
attitude in spreading the use of Hindi.
According to the Constitution, the use
of English for official purposes was to
stop in 1965. However, many nonHindi speaking States demanded that
the use of English continue. In Tamil
Nadu, this movement took a violent
for m. The Central Gover nment
responded by agreeing to continue the
use of English along with Hindi for
official purposes. Many critics think
that this solution favoured the Englishspeaking elite. Promotion of Hindi

All this changed significantly
after 1990. This period saw the rise
of regional political parties in many
States of the country. This was also
the beginning of the era of
COA L I T I O N G OV E R N M E N T S at the
Centre. Since no single party got a
clear majority in the Lok Sabha, the
major national parties had to enter
into an alliance with many parties
including several regional parties to
form a government at the Centre.
This led to a new culture of power
sharing and respect for the autonomy
of State Governments. This trend was

continues to be the official policy of
the Government of India. Promotion
does not mean that the Central
Government can impose Hindi on
States where people speak a different
language. The flexibility shown by
Indian political leaders helped our
country avoid the kind of situation that
Sri Lanka finds itself in.

Linguistic diversity of India

D e m o c ra t i c Po l i t i c s

How many languages do we have in
India? The answer depends on how
one counts it. The latest
information that we have is from
the Census of India held in 2011.
This census recorded more than
1300 distinct languages which
people mentioned as their mother
tongues. These languages were
grouped together under some major
languages. For example languages
like Bhojpuri, Magadhi,
Bundelkhandi, Chhattisgarhi,
Rajasthani and many others were
grouped together under ‘Hindi’.
Even after this grouping, the
Census found 121 major languages.
Of these 22 languages are now
included in the Eighth Schedule of
the Indian Constitution and are
therefore called ‘Scheduled
Languages’. Others are called
‘non-Scheduled Languages’. In
terms of languages, India is
perhaps the most diverse country
in the world.

the basis of this information.

Decentralisation in India

D e m o c ra t i c Po l i t i c s

So, we are like a
three-tier coach
in a train! I
always prefer the
lower berth!

We noted above that federal
governments have two or more tiers
of governments. We have so far
discussed the two-tiers of government
in our country. But a vast country like
India cannot be run only through these
two-tiers. States in India are as large as
independent countries of Europe. In
terms of population, Uttar Pradesh is
bigger than Russia, Maharashtra is
about as big as Germany. Many of
these States are internally very diverse.
There is thus a need for power sharing
within these States. Federal power
sharing in India needs another tier of
government, below that of the State
governments. This is the rationale for
decentralisation of power. Thus,
resulted a third-tier of government,
called local government.
When power is taken away from
Central and State governments and given
to local government, it is called
decentralisation. The basic idea behind
decentralisation is that there are a large
number of problems and issues which
are best settled at the local level. People
have better knowledge of problems in
their localities. They also have better ideas
on where to spend money and how to
manage things more efficiently. Besides,
at the local level it is possible for the
people to directly participate in decision
making. This helps to inculcate a habit
of democratic participation. Local
government is the best way to realise one
important principle of democracy,
namely local self-government.
The need for decentralisation was
recognised in our Constitution. Since
then, there have been several attempts
to decentralise power to the level of
villages and towns. Panchayats in

24
2020-21

villages and municipalities in urban
areas were set up in all the States. But
these were directly under the control
of state governments. Elections to
these local governments were not held
regularly. Local governments did not
have any powers or resources of their
own. Thus, there was very little
decentralisation in effective terms.
A major step towards decentralisation was taken in 1992. The
Constitution was amended to make the
third-tier of democracy more powerful
and effective.
l Now it is constitutionally
mandatory to hold regular elections to
local government bodies.
l Seats are reserved in the elected
bodies and the executive heads of
these institutions for the Scheduled
Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other
Backward Classes.
l At least one-third of all positions
are reserved for women.
l An independent institution called
the State Election Commission has
been created in each State to conduct
panchayat and municipal elections.
l The State governments are required
to share some powers and revenue with
local government bodies. The nature of
sharing varies from State to State.
Rural local g overnment is
popularly known by the name
panchayati raj. Each village, or a group
of villages in some States, has a gram
panchayat. This is a council consisting
of several ward members, often called
panch, and a president or sarpanch.
They are directly elected by all the
adult population living in that ward

The local government structure
goes right up to the district level. A
few gram panchayats are grouped
together to form what is usually called
a panchayat samiti or block or mandal.
The members of this representative
body are elected by all the panchyat
members in that area. All the panchayat
samitis or mandals in a district together

constitute the zilla (district) parishad.
Most members of the zilla parishad are
elected. Members of the Lok Sabha
and MLAs of that district and some
other officials of other district level
bodies are also its members. Zilla
parishad chairperson is the political
head of the zilla parishad.
Similarly, local government bodies
exist for urban areas as well.
Municipalities are set up in towns. Big
cities are constituted into municipal
corporations. Both municipalities and
municipal corporations are controlled
by elected bodies consisting of people’s
representatives. Municipal chairperson
is the political head of the municipality.
In a municipal corporation such an
officer is called the mayor.

What do these newspaper clippings have to say about efforts of decentralisation in India?

Prime Minister runs
the country. Chief
Minister runs the
state. Logically,
then, the
chairperson of Zilla
Parishad should
run the district.
Why does the D.M.
or Collector

or village. It is the decision-making
body for the entire village. The
panchayat works under the overall
supervision of the gram sabha. All the
voters in the village are its members.
It has to meet at least twice or thrice
in a year to approve the annual budget
of the gram panchayat and to review
the perfor mance of the g ram
panchayat.

An experiment in Brazil
A city called Porto Alegre in Brazil has carried out an extraordinary experiment
in combining decentralisation with participative democracy. The city has set up a
parallel organisation operating alongside the municipal council, enabling local
inhabitants to take real decisions for their city. The nearly 13 lakh people in this
city get to participate in making the budget for their own city. The city is divided
into many sectors or what we call wards. Each sector has a meeting, like that of
the gram sabha, in which anyone living in that area can participate. There are
some meetings to discuss issues that affect the entire city. Any citizen of the city
can participate in those meetings. The budget of the city is discussed in these
meetings. The proposals are put to the municipality that takes a final decision
about it.
About 20,000 people participate in this decision making exercise every year.
This method has ensured that the money cannot be spent only for the benefit of
the colonies where rich people live. Buses now run to the poor colonies and
builders cannot evict slum-dwellers without resettling them.
In our own country, a similar experiment has taken place in some areas in
Kerala. Ordinary people have participated in making a plan for the development
of their locality.

D e m o c ra t i c Po l i t i c s

This new system of local
government is the largest experiment
in democracy conducted anywhere in
the world. There are now about 36 lakh
elected representatives in the
panchayats and municipalities etc., all
over the country. This number is bigger
than the population of many countries
in the world. Constitutional status for
local government has helped to deepen
democracy in our country. It has also

increased women’s representation and
voice in our democracy. At the same
time, there are many difficulties. While
elections are held regularly and
enthusiastically, gram sabhas are not
held regularly. Most state governments
have not transferred significant powers
to the local governments. Nor have
they given adequate resources. We are
thus still a long way from realising the
ideal of self-government.

Find out about the local government in the village or town you live in.
If you live in a village, find out the names of the following: your panch or ward
member, your sarpanch, your panchayat samiti, the chairperson of your zilla
parishad. Also find out when did the last meeting of the gram sabha take place and
