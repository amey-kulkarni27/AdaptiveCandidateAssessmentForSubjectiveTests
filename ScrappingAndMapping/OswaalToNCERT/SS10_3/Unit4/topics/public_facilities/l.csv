Literacy Rate : This is an indicator of the number of schools and teachers available in a region and also indicates whether the facilities are being used or not due to societal pressures. Low literacy rate shows backwardness and there will not be fast economic development.  Life Expectancy : This is also an indicator of available health facilities. Low life expectancy will be a hindrance to economic development.  5"
