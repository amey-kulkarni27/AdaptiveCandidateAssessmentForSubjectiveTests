In the hilly terrains of the peninsular region, railway tracks are laid through low hills, gaps or tunnels.  The Himalayan mountainous regions too are unfavourable for the construction of railway lines due to high relief, sparse population and lack of economic opportunities.  It was difficult to lay railway lines on the sandy plain of western Rajasthan, swamps of Gujarat, forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand.  The contiguous stretch of Sahyadri could be crossed only through gaps or passes .
