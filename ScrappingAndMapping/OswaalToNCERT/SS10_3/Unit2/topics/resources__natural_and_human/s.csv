Distinguish between the renewable and nonrenewable resources.  Explain the types of resources on the basis of exhaustibility with the help of examples. ," Renewable resources : Resources which can be renewed or reproduced by mechanical, physical or chemical processes are known as renewable or replenishable resources, e.g., solar and wind energy, water, forests and wildlife, etc. ) Non-renewable resources : These occur over very (ii long geological times. Minerals and fossil fuels are examples of such resources. These resources take millions of years in their formation. Some of the resources like metals are recyclable and some of them such as fossil fuels cannot be recycled and get exhausted with their use. "
Distinguish between stock and potential resource. Give one example of each.  ," Stock :  They are found in the environment.  They are not accessed due to the lack of technology.  Example : Water is a compound of two inflammable gases—hydrogen and oxygen, which can be used as a rich source of energy. But we do not have the required technical know-how to use them for this purpose.  Potential resources :  They are found in a region.  They have not been utilized or developed.  Example : Rajasthan and Gujarat have enormous potential for the development of wind and solar energy but they are yet to be developed for various reasons.  1½+1½=3"
Differentiate between stock and reserve stating two points of difference. ,"Stock : Materials, which have the potential to satisfy human beings but human do not have the appropriate technology to access these, are termed as stock. We do not have the required technical ‘know-how’ to use them for a specific purpose. e.g., water which is a compound of two inflammable gases—hydrogen and oxygen and can be a rich source of energy. We We do not know kno w how to use them. Reserves : These are subset of the stock. They can be put into use with existing know-how kno w-how but their use has not been started.

"Why is it essential to have resource planning ? Explain any three reasons. [Board Term-I erm-I,, (OEQL2HT ) 2016-17]", If the present trend of resource depletion by few individuals continues the future of our planet is in danger  Planning is essential for sustainable existence of all forms of life.  Indiscriminate exploitation of resources has led to global ecological crises. 
What are the three stages of resource planning in India ? ," Identification and inventory of resources across the regions of the country.  Evolving a planning structure structure endowed endowed with appropriate technology, skill and institutional set up for implementing resource development plans.  Match the resource development plans plans with overall national development plans.  "
"“In India, some regions are rich rich in certain types of resources but deficient in some other resources”. Do you agree with the statement ? Support your answer with any three examples. ","Yes, there are regions which are rich in certain types of resources but are deficient in some other resources.  Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits.  Arunachal Pradesh has abundance of water resources but lacks in infrastructural development.  Rajasthan is endowed with solar and wind energy but lacks in water resources.  Ladakh has rich cultural heritage but lacks in water  resources and infrastructure.  1 × 3 = 3"
