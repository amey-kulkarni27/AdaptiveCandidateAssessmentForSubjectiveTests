Compare and contrast the merits and demerits of roadways with those of railways. ,"Roadways v/s Railways :  Construction cost of roads is much lower than that of railway lines and construction time is also comparatively less.  Roads can traverse comparatively more dissected and undulating topography which is a limitation in case of railways.  Roads can negotiate higher gradients of slopes and as such can traverse mountains like the Himalayas, whereas the mountainous regions are unfavourable for the construction of railway lines due to high relief, sparse population and lack of economic opportunities. Likewise, it is difficult to lay railway lines on the sandy plains in the deserts, swampy or forested tracks.  Road transport is economical in transportation of few persons and relatively smaller amount of goods over short distances, whereas railways are suitable for transportation of large number of people and goods in bulk, especially over long distances.  Roadways provide door-to-door service, thus the cost of loading and unloading is much lower but railways have not reached everywhere, still there are places which are yet to be connected with the railways.  Road transport is also used as a feeder to other modes of transport such as they provide a link between railway stations, air and seaports. On the other hand, railways work as a lifeline for the economic growth of a country as they carry raw materials and produced goods from one part of the nation to another on a large scale.  1 × 5 = 5 "
Analyse the physiographic and economic factors that have influenced the distribution pattern of the railway network in our country country.. ,"Rail transport is the most convenient mode of transportation. Though the railway network is not evenly distributed across the country. The distribution pattern of the railway network in the country has been largely influenced by physiographic, economic and administrative factors. Physiographic Factors :  The northern plains with their vast level land, high p opulation density and rich agricultural resources provide the most favourable condition for their growth of railway networks.  The uneven terrain like hills, mountains, rivers with wide beds have posed severe obstacle in the infrastructural development of railways like laying tracks, construction of bridges and so on.  In the hilly terrain of the peninsular region, railway tracks are laid through low hills, gaps or tunnels.  The Himalayan mountainous regions too are unfavourable for the construction of railway lines due to high relief, sparse population and lack of economic opportunities.  It is equally difficult on the sandy plain of western Rajasthan, swamps of Gujarat, forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand. Economic Factors :  There are several economic factors that affect the distribution of railways e.g. state funding plays a vital role in the development of railways across the nations.  The state with flexible laws supports the growth of railways. Along with this the places that are highly industrialised attract the development of railways. Since the growth of both is complimentary to each other e.g. recently railways network is enhancing along the industrial corridors. "
“Road transport and Rail transport in India are not competitive but complementary to each other.” Justify the statement. ,"Road Transport and Rail Transport Transport : The statement ‘Road Transport’ and ‘Rail Transport’ in India are not competitive but complementary to each other are justified in the following ways :  Road transport is more suitable for short distances whereas rail transport is more suitable for long distances.  Road transport is economical in transportation of few persons and relatively smaller amount of goods over short distances, whereas rail transport is more suitable for large number of people and heavy goods.  It is beneficial for perishable goods to be carried by roads in short period of time, whereas nonperishable and bulky are transported by railways for a longer distances.  Road transport increases the efficiency of railways.  Road transport links the rural areas with railway stations.  The deficiency of railways is compensated by road  1 × 5 = 5 transport. "
‘‘Indian Railways binds the economic life of the country as well as accelerates the development of industry and agriculture.’’ Justify the statement. ,"Railways are the most important mode of transport in India due to the following reasons :  Railways are the principal mode of transportation for freight and passengers in India, as they link different parts of the country.  They carry huge loads and bulky goods to long distances.  Railways make it possible to conduct multifarious activities like business, sightseeing, pilgrimage along with goods transportation over longer distances.  Railways have been a great integrating force for the nation, for more than 150 years now.  They have been helpful in binding the economic life of the country and cultural fusion.  They have accelerated the development of the  1 × 5 = 5 industry and agriculture. "
Classify roads into six classes according to their capacity. What is the role of National Highway Authority of India ? ,"Roads are classified classified as given below :  Golden Quadrilateral Super Highways reduced the time and distance between the mega cities of India.  National Highways connect the state capitals, big cities and important ports.  State Highways join the state capitals with district headquarters.  District Roads connect the district centres with the major roads.  Other Rural Roads which link rural areas and villages with towns.  Border Roads have increased accessibility in areas of difficult terrain. Projects related to Super Highways are being implemented by the NHAI.  1 × 5 = 5"
