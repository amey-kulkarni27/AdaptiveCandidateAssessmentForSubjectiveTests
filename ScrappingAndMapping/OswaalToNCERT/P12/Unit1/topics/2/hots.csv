India too supported Soviet foreign policy in some crucial but indirect ways (When US had sent flotillas in Pacific Ocean).

"Write an essay for or against the following proposition. With the disintegration of the Second World, India should change its foreign policy and focus more on friendship with the US rather than with traditional friends like Russia. ","The arguments in favour and against the statement are as follows: Arguments in favour: Unipolar system was originated in the World after the disintegration of Soviet Union. USA was the only superpower on international front. The war which continued for so many years between communist and capitalist ideology was finally ended along with the disintegration of Soviet Union. The capitalist system had proved its superiority over communist system. That’s why India needs to change its foreign policies and should lend a hand of friendship towards America. America wants to establish trade relationship with India for its own interest. So, India should be conscious while establishing its trade relationships and should exercise the friendship of superpower of the world to its own interests. Arguments in against: Indo-Soviet relations have always been cordial. Russia had always helped India. Although, India was a non-aligned country, even then Soviet Union provided India with economic and military assistance at the time of Bangladesh crises in 1971. Indo-Soviet relations became deeper after Tashkent treaty to avoid Indo Pak War. Indo-Russian relations were cordial even after disintegration of Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin visited India on 27 January 1993, where he signed an Indo-Russian treaty for military and technical agreement. India stood benefitted from its relationship with Russia on issues like Kashmir. On 23 December 1994, the Russian P.M. visited India and  agreement was signed between both the countries for military, technology and trade. Russia supported India during Indo-Pak War. On 7 December 1999, a ten-year agreement between India and Russia was signed. According to this, Indo-Russia would collectively produce military and non-military aircrafts. Indian nuclear tests were supported by Russia in 1998. By keeping in mind all the above factors, we reach on a conclusion that India should not be much dependent on America after having Russia, as a trusted friend. The following are the reasons for the above conclusion: 1. America forced Britain to free India but it opposed India when India adopted nonalignment policy after independence. Instead, it supported Pakistan, India’s rival country and started providing military assistance to Pakistan. 2. America doesn’t want India to emerge as a powerful nation. It opposed India’s nuclear tests and forced India to sign Nuclear Treaty CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty). India always stood against America’s dual policy. 3. America also adopts a dual policy on the issue of terrorism. It says India to remain patient on the issue of Pakistan’s terror attacks. On the contrary, it attacked Afghanistan, causing huge devastation when it was under terror attack. 4. Indo-America’s relationship can’t be as cordial as Pak-America relationship. Pakistan has always been a country of America’s alliance and also gained military assistance from America."

What was Shock therapy? Was this the best way to make a transition from communism to capitalism? ,"Most of the Soviet Union republics went through painful process of transition from an authoritarian socialist system to a democratic capitalist system after the collapse of communism. The model of transition in Russia, Central Asia and East Europe was influenced by World Bank and the IMF came to be known as ‘Shock therapy’. Shock therapy varied in intensity and speed amongst the former second world countries, but its direction and features remained the same. Each of these countries was required to make a total shift to a capitalist economy, which meant rooting out completely any structures evolved during the Soviet period. Above all, it meant that private ownership was to be the dominant pattern of ownership of property. Privatisation of state assets and corporate ownership patterns were to be immediately brought in. Collective forms were to be replaced by private farming and capitalism in agriculture. This transition ruled out any alternate or ‘third way’, other than state-controlled socialism or capitalism. Shock therapy also involved a drastic change in the external orientation of these economies. Development was now envisaged through more free trade, and thus a  sudden and complete switch to free trade was considered essential. The free trade regime and foreign direct investment were to be the main engines of change. To bring the change in foreign investment and currency, ‘financial opening up or deregulation’ policies were followed. Shock therapy was not the best way to make a transition from communism to capitalism. It had few shortcomings: 1. It brought ruin to the economies and disaster upon the people of the entire region. 2. Due to it, large state – controlled industrial complex almost collapsed, as about 90% of its industries were put up for sale to private individuals and companies. 3. The rate of inflation raised high and the value of ruble declined. 4. Food crisis arose and because of this they started importing food. 5. Inequality between rich and poor increased. 6. The building of democratic institutions was weak.  "
