How many types of meristems are found on the basis of origin?,"Depending upon the mode of origin, meristems are classified into three types: (i) Promeristem: (a) Promeristems are also called primordial meristems or embryonic meristems. (b) These are localized groups of meristematic cells in germinating embryos or young seedlings. (c) Promeristems give rise to primary meristems where formation of new organs are initiated. (ii) Primary meristems: (a) These are the meristems, which are derived from the promeristems and retain the capacity to divide throughout the life of the plant. (b) They are represented by apical meristem, intercalary meristem and intrafascicular cambium. (c) The primary meristems form different primary permanent tissues. (d) The intrafascicular cambium, produces secondary vascular tissues and medullary rays. (iii) Secondary meristems: (a) These are the meristem, which are formed from permanent tissues by the process of differentiation. (b) They are represented by interfascicular cambium, vascular cambium, cork cambium or phellogen, wound cambium and accessory cambium. (c) They all are lateral in position and give rise to secondary permanent tissues that result in radial growth."
Give a brief account on the components of xylem.,"Epidermal tissue system: It is the outermost protective tissue of the plant organs. It is derived from Protoderm and consists of epidermis, stomata and epidermal outgrowths. (i) Epidermis: (a) Epidermis is usually single layered, but in the leaves of some tropical plants it is more than one layer in thickness. (b) There is a layer of cutin, on the outer side of the epidermis of aerial parts of the plants called cuticle. (c) Epidermis along with cuticle protect the inner cells against loss of water, mechanical injury, attack of pathogens and leaching effect of rain. (d) The epidermis of grasses and cereals has a deposition of silica. (ii) Stomata are structures present in the epidermis of leaves which regulates the process of transpiration and gaseous exchange. (iii) Epidermal outgrowths: (a) The epidermis of most plants often bear outgrowths called epidermal outgrowths. They are of two type â€“ Trichomes and hairs. (a) On the stem, the epidermal hairs are called trichomes. They are usually multicellular, branched or unbranched and soft or stiff. They may be secondary also. The trichomes help in preventing water loss due to transpiration. (b) The root epidermis bears unicellular outgrowths called root hairs. It is therefore, also called piliferous layer or epiblema. It is mainly concerned with the absorption of water and minerals from the soil."
What is root apes? Name the three meristematic regions of it.,"Meristems or meristematic tissues are the tissues which are made up of group of immature and similar cells, that are in continuous state of division, forming new cells. The cells of a meristematic tissue are characterised by the following features: (i) The cells are immature and are capable of dividing indefinitely. (ii) They are small and thin walled cells, without intercellular spaces. (iii) The cells are generally isodiametric (almost of same length and breadth) and are rounded, oval or polygonal in outline. (iv) They have thin and elastic cell wall, made up of cellulose. (v) The vacuoles are absent or are very small. Cambium cells, however, possess large vacuoles. (vi) The plastids are present in proplastid stage. (vii) The cells do not store reserve food and are in active stage of metabolism. (viii) The cells lack inorganic crystals and other ergastic substances. (ix) The meristematic cells are mother cells from which all other types of cells are formed."
Q. 6 What is phloem? Explain its components.,"Phloem: Phloem is a complex permanent tissue, which is meant for the conduction of food within the plant. It is also called bast or leptome. Phloem consists of four types of cells: (i) Sieve elements: They are the main food conducting elements and are of two types-sieve cells and sieve tubes. (a) Sieve cells: They are elongated cells having several perforated areas called sieve areas. (b) Sieve tubes: They are elongated tubular channels. Each sieve tube is made up of several cells called sieve tube members. The end walls have many large pores or sieve pits and are known as sieve plates. Each sieve tube is associated with a companion cell. Sieve element take part in the transport of organic food. (ii) Companion cells: They are elongated thin walled parenchymatous cells, which lie on the sides of the sieve tubes. The companion cell and a sieve tube originate from the same mother cell. The companion cells play an important role in the maintenance of a pressure gradient in the sieve tubes. (iii) Phloem parenchyma: They are ordinary parenchyma cells, which are intermingled with sieve elements. They store food and also assist in the conduction of food in lateral direction. (iv) Phloem fibres: They are also called bast fibres, Phloem fibres are sclerenchymatous fibres, which occur in phloem. They provide mechanical strength. The textile fibres of flex,  hemp and jute are phloem fibres. "
What are simple permanent tissues? Briefly explain their types.,"Simple permanent tissues: A simple permanent tissue is the tissue which is made up of similar permanent cells that carry out the same function or similar set of functions. Simple permanent tissues are of three types: (i) Parenchyma: (a) Parenchyma is a simple permanent living tissue which is made up of thin-walled similar isodiametric cells. (b) They may be oval, rounded or polygonal in outline. (c) The cell wall is made up of cellulose. (d) Cells may be closely packed or have small intercellular spaces for exchange of gases. Internally each cell encloses a large central vacuole and a peripheral cytoplasm containing nucleus. (e) The adjacent parenchyma cells are connected with one another by plasmodesmata. (f) The typical parenchyma is meant for the storage of food, slow conduction of various substances and for providing turgidity to the softer parts of the plants. (ii) Collenchyma: (a) Collenchyma is a simple permanent tissue of non-lignified living cells which possess pecto-cellulose thickenings in specific areas of their walls. (b) The cells are often elongated. They are circular, oval or angular in transverse section. Each cell possesses a large central vacuole and a peripheral cytoplasm. Wall possesses uneven longitudinal thickenings in specific areas. (iii) Sclerenchyma: (a) Sclerenchyma is a simple supportive tissue of highly thick-walled cells with little or no protoplasm. (b) The cell cavities are narrow. The thickening of the wall is made up of cellulose or lignin or both. (c) Sclerenchyma is of two types-Sclerenchyma fibres and Sclereids. (a) Sclerenchyma fibres: The sclerenchyma fibres are highly elongated, narrow and spindle-  shaped they have thick-walled cells with pointed or oblique end walls. The adjacent fibres possess simple oblique pits. Sclerenchyma fibres constitute the major mechanical tissue of the plants because they can bear compression, pull, bending and shearing. (b) Sclereids: They are highly thickened dead sclerenchyma cells with very narrow cavities. Sclereids are broader as compared to the fibres being isodiametric polyhedral, short or cylindrical."
Explain how the activity of fascicular cambium and cork cambium contribute towards the growth in thickness of a dicot stem. ,"Primary growth produces growth in length and development of lateral appendages. Secondary growth is the formation of secondary tissues from lateral meristems. It increases the diameter of the stem. Secondary tissues are formed by two types of lateral meristems, fascicular cambium and cork cambium. Fascicular cambium: The vascular bundles have intrafascicular cambium between xylem and phloem. Interfascicular cambium is formed from parenchyma cells between vascular bundles. Fascicular and interfascicular cambium join to form a complete ring of vascular cambium. The cells of cambium ring divide diagonally to form secondary phloem outside and secondary xylem towards the inner side. The amount of secondary xylem produced is always greater than that of secondary phloem. Due to formation of greater amount of secondary xylem, the cambium ring moves towards the periphery and the primary xylem and phloem which were near together are separated far apart. Cork cambium: The outermost layer of cortex becomes meristematic and is called cork cambium. Sometimes hypodermis also become meristematic and forms cork cambium. The cells of cork cambium divide by periclinal division towards outer side to form cork. The cork has rectangular cells which become dead at maturity. These are highly thick walled due to the presence of a chemical called suberin. Thus cork is also called suberised tissue. The cork is impervious to water and thus outer layers like hypodermis and epidermis become dead. The cells of the cork Cambium also divide towards their inner side by periclinal divisions to form secondary cortex. It has loosely packed parenchymatous cells which are thick walled. The phellem, phellogen and phelloderm are collectively called periderm. All dead cells outer to cork cambium form bark. It includes dead cells cork, hypodermis and epidermis."
How many vascular bundles are found on the basis of arrangements of xylem and phloem? ,"According to the arrangement of xylem and phloem, the vascular bundles are of following types: (i) Radial: The xylem and phloem form separate bundles and lie on different radii, alternating with each other. Radial bundles are the most primitive type of vascular bundles and are characteristic of roots. (ii) Conjoint: The vascular bundles which contain both xylem and phloem are called conjoint vascular bundles. The xylem and phloem are thus, arranged on the same radius. Conjoint bundles are of following three types:  (a) Collateral: A conjoint bundle with xylem towards the inner side facing the pith and phloem towards the outer side facing the cortex, is called collateral bundle. When in a collateral bundle, a strip of cambium is present between xylem and phloem, the bundle is called open bundle e.g., dicot stems. When a collateral bundle is without a strip of cambium, it is said to be closed, e.g., monocot stems. (b) Bicollateral: When a conjoint bundle has phloem both on the outer and inner side of xylem it is called bicollateral bundle. Usually a strip of cambium is present on both outer and inner sides of xylem. e.g., family Cucurbitaceae. (c) Concentric: A type of conjoint vascular bundle with one vascular element completely surrounds the other. Either the phloem surrounds xylem or xylem surrounds the phloem."
What is wood? Write its different types ,"Wood: A secondary xylem is called as wood. It is formed by the metabolism of the plant. i.e., secondary growth by cambium and constitutes the bulk of the plant body in dicot stems and dicot roots. Wood can be classified into the following categories: (i) Hard wood: It is the wood produced by angiosperms, It consists mainly of xylem vessels (95%) and hence called porous wood. (ii) Soft wood: It is the wood produced by gymnosperms. It consists mainly of xylem tracheids and hence called non-porous wood. (iii) Heart wood: It is the central core of wood formed during secondary growth. It consists of dead cells. The cells are dark in colour due to the presence of extractives like gums, resins, tannins etc. It is more durable and resistant to attack by microbes and insect pests. (iv) Sap wood: It is the peripheral part of the wood formed during secondary growth. It consists of living cells. The cells are lighter in colour (Compared to heart wood) as extractives are absent. It is less durable and resistant to attack by microbes and insects. (v) Early wood: It is the wood formed during favourable seasons (spring and summer). The vessels and tracheids are larger in dimensions. (vi) Late wood: It is the wood formed during unfavourable seasons (autumn and winter). The vessels and tracheids are smaller in dimension."
Why do stems of dicot plants increase in girth every year? Explain this growth with the help of suitable schematic diagrams.  Explain the process of secondary growth in the stem of weedy angiosperms with the help of schematic diagrams. ,"Secondary growth: It is the permanent increase in thickness due to the activity of the vascular cambium and cock cambium in stelar and extrastelar regions. The cock cambium gives rise to cork and secondary cortex whereas the vascular cambium gives rise to secondary xylem and secondary phloem. The roots of stem increase in girth due to secondary growth. Process of secondary growth in Typical Dicot Stem: The process of secondary growth in stem is completed in the following stages: Stage A. (i) It shows the primary structure of a young dicot stem. (ii) The vascular bundles are open and arranged in a ring. (iii) The cortex, medullary says and pith are well marked. (iv) The cambium between the phloem and xylem is called fascicular cambium' (intrafascicular  cambium). Stage B. (i) The medullary rays (parenchyma cells) in line with the intrafascicular cambium becomes meristematic and form the 'inter -fascicular cambium'. (ii) The intrafascicular and interfascicular cambium join and form a continuous cambial ring. Stage C. (i) By the meristematic activity of cambial cells, the secondary phloem is produced towards outside and the secondary xylem towards inside. (ii) Secondary xylem is produced in much amount than secondary phloem due to more divisions taking place towards the xylem. The primary and secondary phloems get gradually crushed due to the continued formation and accumulation of secondary xylem. Stage D. (i) Secondary growth continues resulting in the increasing amount of vascular tissue. (ii) The wood (older secondary xylem) is pushed towards the centre. (iii) The pith and the primary xylem get traced. This wood is called 'heart wood'. It is harder and more durable. It is mainly for mechanical support. (iv) The wood formed due to deposition of some kind of material, each year laying outside just internal to the hard of cambium is called â€˜sap woodâ€™. It is softer than heart wood. It is mainly for conducting water and minerals. Annual rings, later wood and early wood: (i) During summer and spring seasons, the size of the secondary xylem vessels produced is much larger, whereas in winter and autumn the size of secondary xylem vessels produced is much smaller. Thus in one year alternate smaller and larger vessels are seen as rings in the wood. (ii) A single growth ring formed each year is called 'annual ring'. (iii) These rings are helpful in determining the age of a tree. (iv) The denser wood having more fibres is called 'late wood'. The larger thinner walled wood with less fibres is called 'early woodâ€™.  Fig. Secondary growth in a dicot stem (diagrammatic) stages in transverse views"
Describe the internal structure of a dicotyledonous stem/root.,"(A) Internal structure of a dicot stem: (i) Epidermis: It is the outermost single layered covering of stem having no intercellular spaces. It is covered by cuticle to reduce transpiration. Multicellular hairs are also present.  (ii) Cortex: Inner to the epidermis is cortex consisting of multilayered hypodermis and parenchymatous cortex to provide mechanical strength. Resin ducts may be in the region of cortex. (iii) Endodermis: It is the outermost layer of cortex having barrel-shaped parenchyma cells containing starch grains. (iv) Stele: Stele includes Pericycle, vascular bundles, pith (medulla) and pith rays (medullary rays). Vascular bundles vary from 5-7 in numbers and are arranged in a ring. They are open and collateral. Xylem is endarch. Pith lies in the centre having parenchyma cells with intercellular spaces.  (B) Internal structure of a dicotyledonous root: (i) Epiblema: It is called piliferous layer (outermost one-celled thick). Unicellular root hairs extend to outside from the epiblema. (ii) Cortex: It is the main part of root having many layers of rounded parenchymatous cells containing starch grains. Intercellular spaces are present in between them. It stores food substances. (iii) Endodermis: It lies inner to cortex and contains barrel-shaped cells having no intercellular spaces. Radial walls of its cells may have lignified casparian strips. Water and minerals pass through passage cells to phloem. (iv) Stele: It is the central part of dicot root. Inner to endodermis lies Pericycle which is single layered thick only. Vascular bundles form a ring. Phloem and xylem are present in different radii to form separate bundles.  Xylem in exarch: In the centre, pith and xylem fuse together. Phloem has sieve tubes, companion cells and phloem parenchyma. Between xylem and phloem conjunctive tissue is present."
Write a detailed note on the vascular bundles of monocot root ,"Vascular bundles: (a) It is in the form of several alternate and radial xylem and phloem bundles. (b) The number is 20-30 in maize. (c) In many cases the vascular bundles are embedded in a cylinder of sclerenchymatous conjunctive tissue. (d) The vascular bundles are arranged in the form of ring around a central pith. (e) The xylem bundles are exarch, i.e., protoxylem lies towards the outside while the metaxylem faces inward. Because of the presence of numerous xylem bundles and exarch condition, xylem of monocot root is polyarch. (f) Xylem is made up of rounded or oval vessels, and are narrow. (g) Xylem provides mechanical strength and helps in the conduction of water and mineral salts. (h) Phloem bundles alternate with the xylem bundles. These two are separated from each other by means of narrow strip of conjunctive tissue. (i) Monocotyledonous roots do not undergo any secondary growth.  "
