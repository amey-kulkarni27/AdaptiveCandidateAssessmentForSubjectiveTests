Why does it become difficult to breathe at high altitudes ?,"At high altitudes, the concentration of oxygen becomes less. At a height of about 15,000 feet or more, the pressure also decreases along with a decrease in the oxygen  content. Persons reaching such heights are unable to get the amount of oxygen required for proper functioning of their body. Due to this, sufficient oxygen does not diffuse into the blood, as a result of which the person suffers from nausea, headache and delusion. As a result he finds it difficult to breathe."
Why do you breathe faster while running ?,"The metabolism of food increases due to the supply of more energy to the body, while running. Due to this process more carbon dioxide is added into the blood and its concentration in the blood is increased above normal, which stimulates the respiratory centre in the brain. The respiratory centre sends the stimulus to the muscles of ribs and diaphragm through the nerves for faster and deeper respiration. Thus we breathe faster during running or hard physical work."
CO 2 is carried by haemoglobin as carbamino.  (DDE 2017) ,"Haemoglobin (about 20-25 percent). This binding is related to the PCO 2 pO2 is a major factor which affect this binding. When pCO 2 is high and pO2 is low as in tissues, more binding of carbon dioxide occurs whereas, when the PCO 2 is low and PO 2 is high as in the alveoli, dissociation of CO 2 from carbamino-haemoglobin takes place. The CO 2 is now delivered at the alveoli."
How is oxygen transported in the blood and released in the tissues ? 2009]  [NCT- ,"(i) Blood carries oxygen from the lungs to the heart and from the heart to various body parts.

(viii) This blood in alveolar capillaries contains pCO 2 which falls to 40 mm Hg. (ix) In the alveoli of the lungs O 2 is taken up by vein and CO 2 is given out from blood through artery. 
How does gaseous exchange takes place in tissues ?,"(i) Gaseous exchange initially takes place between the alveoli of lungs and blood capillaries and finally between blood capillaries and tissues by a physical process called diffusion. (ii) The oxygenated blood from the lungs is carried to the heart for distribution to individual body cells. (iii) The blood reaching the tissue capillaries has pO2 of 95 mm Hg and pCO 2 of 40 mm Hg while the cells has pO 2 of 20 and pCO 2 of 52 mm Hg. (iv) Because of differences in partial pressures of blood and tissue cells, oxygen diffuses from the blood into the cells, and carbon dioxide from the cells into the blood through tissue fluid which acts as middle man. (v) The final diffusion of gases in the tissues lowers the pO 2 of the blood and raises its pCO 2. (vi) This process is called internal respiration or tissue respiration."

Dissociation takes place in the alveoli and the CO 2 is finally, exhaled through the nostrils."
Why is haemoglobin called conjugated protein ? What happens to the molecule at high and low partial pressure of oxygen ?,"Haemoglobin is called conjugated protein because it consists of a basic protein globulin and a non-protein called haem. The haemoglobin, when exposed to high partial pressure of  oxygen, combines with it to form oxyhaemoglobin, which carries four molecules of oxygen loosely bound to the four Fe2+ ions. When this oxyhaemoglobin reaches the tissues where there is low oxygen pressure, oxyhaemoglobin dissociates into oxygen and deoxyhemoglobin."
What happens to the leg muscle of an athlete who runs a marathon race ?,"While running a marathon race, the internal muscle respires anaerobically as they do not get the required increased supply of oxygen at that time. This results in the deposition of lactic acid in them. As a result of the lactic acid deposition, the leg muscles feel cramps. Lactic acid, thus produced will be oxidised later by other tissues."
Write short notes on mountain sickness.,"On mountain-tops about 8000ft. above from the sea level, one has difficulty in breathing due to considerable decrease in the oxygen in the air. Consequently, the alveolar pO 2 reduces and oxygen cannot be diffused into the blood. Thus, the process of oxygenation of blood progressively gets decreased to such an extent that the person develops mountain sickness. It produces a number of symptoms like breathlessness, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and a bluishness of skin, nails and lips. This is because of lack of adequate oxygen. People suffering from heart ailment or blood pressure should not go to such a height.  "

You have eaten boiled rice for lunch. Make a list of enzymes that will act upon the rice and the changes it will undergo before being absorbed in the small intestine.,The protein hydrolyzing enzymes are known as proteases. These proteases are secreted in inactive form and are called proenzymes. If these are secreted in active form these proenzymes would hydrolyze cellular and extra cellular proteins of the individual itself. Pepsin and rennin are secreted in inactive forms - pepsinogen and prorennin. These are activated at the sites of their action in stomach by optimal pH or by specific proteases.  
What is water potential? What is the relationship between water potential with solute potential and pressure? ,"Water potential: It is the difference in the free energy and chemical potential per unit molal volume of water in a solution over its pure state at the same temperature and pressure. Chemical potential of pure water at normal temperature and pressure is zero. It is denoted by Ψ w. Solute potential: All solutions have lower water potential than their pure form. Thus the water potential is inversely proportional to solute concentration, because free energy of water decreases.

(iii) Imbibition is along the concentration gradient and depends upon affinity between adsorbent and liquid being adsorbed."
Write a short note on plasmolysis ?,"It is the process of shrinkage of protoplasm in a cell, away from its cell wall and toward the center. It occurs because of the movement of water from the intracellular space to the outer-cellular space. This happens when the plant cell is placed in a hypertonic solution that is solution having more solute concentration than the cell cytoplasm. This causes the water to move out of the cell (endosmosis) and toward the solution. The cytoplasm of the cell shrinks and the cell is said to be plasmolysed."

Osmotic pressure It is the actual pressure which develops in a solution if it is separated from the water of semipermeable membrane. Osmotic pressure is measured by bar and it is equal to the osmotic potential having a positive value. It is designated as OP. 
What do you understand by mass or bulk flow ?,"Mass flow is the movement of substance in bulk from one point to another as a result of pressure difference between the two points. In mass flow all the substances dissolved or suspended in solution travel at the same pace, which is different from diffusion where substances move independently according to their concentration gradient."

How does the structure of stomata help in its opening and closing.,"The immediate cause of the opening and closing of the stomata is a change in the turgidity of the guard cells. The inner wall of each guard cell, towards the pore is thick and elastic whereas the outerwall is thin. When turgidity increases within the two guard cells flanking each stomatal pore, the thin outer walls bulge out and force the inner walls into a crescent shape. The opening and closing of the stoma is also aided due to the orientation of the microfibrils in the cell walls of the guard cells. Cellulose microfibrils are oriented radially rather than longitudinals making it easier for the stoma to open."
How do rise in temperature and wind velocity affect transpiration ? Write any two adaptations shown by plants to reduce transpiration.,"(i) Temperature: If the temperature is more, the rate of transpiration increases. An increase in the temperature of leaf increases the rate of transpiration. (ii) Wind velocity : During high wind, the transpiration becomes very active because the water vapour around the leaves is instantly removed. At very high wind velocity, the stomata are closed because of rapid loss of water from the guard cells and the rate of transpiration is declined. Two adaptations shown by plants to reduce transpiration are: (i) Reduction in the surface of leaves: The leaves are modified into spines, hence no transpiration takes place. (ii) Sunken stomata : In some, the stomata get sunk. This also reduces the rate of transpiration. e.g., Nerium and Agave."

What are nephrons? Describe the types of nephrons.,"Nephrons are the structural and functional units of the kidneys. On the basis of location, the nephrons are of two types: (i) Juxta-medullary nephron: Their glomeruli are found in the inner margins of the cortex. The loop of Henle lie deep into the medulla. They are associated with vasa recta. They control plasma volume when water supply is short. (ii) Cortical nephrons: They mainly lie in the renal cortex. Their glomeruli are found in the outer cortex. The loops of Henle are short and extend to short distance of medulla. They do not have vasa recta."
What are the functions performed by kidneys?,Kidneys perform following functions: (i) It removes metabolic waste products. (ii) It regulates the water content of body fluids. (iii) It regulates pH of body fluids.  (iv) It regulates the chemical composition of body fluids by removal of substances which are in excess of immediate requirements.
Describe glomerular filtration in human nephrons.,"The glomerular capillaries are narrower than the afferent renal arterioles, therefore the blood pressure in the glomerular capillaries becomes very high and there is continuous process of ultrafiltration through the semi-permeable glomerular capillaries. Filtration of blood occurs through three layers: (i) The endothelium of glomerular blood vessels. (ii) The epithelium of Bowman's capsule and (iii) The basement membrane between the two layers.

They collect the waste from the body and pass them outside the animal through small openings.  Nephron It is the functional unit of kidney in vertebrates.  It is highly convoluted, delicate tubular structure. Made up cup shaped body called Bowman’s capsule. A tuft of capillaries lies in the Bowman’s capsule. The remaining part is divided into a coiled proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle and a distal convoluted tubule. "
How is glomerular filtrate hypertonic and hypotonic in descending and ascending limb of loop of Henle respectively? What is the effect of ADH on collecting tubules?,"Counter current system is found in two limbs of loop of Henle. The ascending limb transports Na+ and some urea into surrounding medullary tissue. It is impermeable to water. So it makes urine dilute or hypotonic. The walls of descending limbs are permeable of water and salt, so Na+ and water from surrounding fluid are absorbed. Thus the contents of urine become hypertonic. ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone): ADH is secreted when the osmotic pressure of blood increases due to excess loss of water from the body. The hormone renders the walls of distal convoluted tubule, collecting tubule (CT) and collecting duct of a nephron permeable to water and increases the reabsorption of water into the surrounding tissues and particular capillaries. The urine becomes hyperosmotic and less in volume and water is conserved in the body.  "
How fall and rise in blood calcium stimulates secretion of parathyroid?,Parathyroid is under the feedback control of blood calcium level. A fall in blood calcium stimulates them to secrete parathormone. A rise in blood calcium inhibits parathormone secretion from them.
Why pituitary gland is called as master gland?,"(i) The pituitary is called ""Master Endocrine Gland"" because of number of hormones it produces and the control it exercises over other endocrine gland.

What is differentiation? How can you distinguish between dedifferentiation and redifferentiation ?,"The cells which are derived from root apical meristem and shoot apical meristem differentiate and mature to perform specific functions. This act leading to maturation is termed as differentiation. During this, the cells undergo a few major structural changes both in their cell walls and protoplasm. (i) In plants, the living differentiated cells can regain the capacity to divide mitotically under certain conditions. The sum of events are termed as dedifferentiation. A dedifferentiated tissue  can act as meristem. e.g., interfasicular vascular cambium, cork cambium and wound meristem. (ii) The product of dedifferentiated cells or tissues which lose the ability to divide are called redifferentiated cells and the term is known as redifferentiation. Secondary xylem and econdary phloem that form interfasicular vascular cambium, secondary cortex and cork are the examples of redifferentiated tissues."
Q. 6 Why is ABA known as 'stress hormone'? Mention any two functions of this hormone. How are they antagonistic to gibberellins? ,"Abscisic acid is also called as stress hormone because the synthesis of abscissic acid is stimulated by drought, water logging and other adverse environmental conditions. It is produced in many parts of the plants but more abundantly inside the chloroplast of green cells. Abscisic acid owes its name to its role in the abscission of plant leaves. In preparation for winter, ABA is produced in terminal buds. This slows plant growth and directs leaf primordia to devlop scales to protect the dormant buds during the cold season. They are antagonistic to gibberellins as gibberellins promotes stem elongation while abscisics acid acts as growth inhibitor."
Define plant hormone. In how many groups does plant growth regulators are classified?,"A plant hormone is a chemical substance produced naturally in plants which is translocated to another region for regulating one or more physiological reaction, when present in low concentration. Based on functions, plant growth regulators are broadly divided into two groups. (i) Growth Promoters: Such plant growth regulators are involved in growth promoting activities such as cell division, cell enlargement, pattern formation etc. These include auxins, gibberellins and cytokinins. (ii) Growth Inhibitors: Such PGRs are involved in various growth inhibiting activities such as promotion of dormancy and abscission. These indude abscisic acid and ethylene."

(ii) Stem elongation and fruit elongation. (iii) Parthenocarpy. (iv) Early seed production. 
What is abscissic acid and why it is called as stress hormone ?,"Abscisic acid is a mildly acidic growth hormone, which functions as a general growth inhibitor by counteracting other hormones or reactions mediated by them. Abscisic acid is also called as stress hormone because the synthesis of abscisic acid is stimulated by drought, water logging and other adverse environmental conditions. It is produced in many parts of the plants but more abundantly inside the chloroplasts of green cells."
"What is the effect of each of the following on germination of seeds: (i) Abscisic acid, (ii) Gibberellin","(i) Abscisic acid (ABA): It is known as growth inhibitor. It is synthesised in leaves and transported to other parts of the plants by phloem. It promotes the dormancy of seeds. ABA inhibits seed germination. The dormancy of seeds is due to abscissic acid. It usually interacts with other plant growth regulators. Dormant seeds germinate when ABA is overcomed by Gibberellins. (ii) During seed germination, especially of cereals, gibberellins stimulates the production of some mRNA and hydrolytic enzymes like amylases, lipases, ribonucleases and proteases. The enzyme solubilises the reserve food of the seed which is then transferred to the embryo axis for its growth."
What is the importance of photoperiodism ?,"Importance of photoperiodism: (i) Photoperiodism determines the season in which a particular plant shall come to flower. (ii) Knowledge of photoperiodic effect is useful in keeping some plants in vegetative growth, to obtain higher yield of tubers, rhizomes etc., or keep the plant in reproductive stage. (iii) The phenomenon has helped the plant breeders in effecting cross-breeding in plants.

Explain the disorders of circulatory system.,"The improper functioning of the heart may lead to certain disorders such as (i) Hypertension : A continuous or sustained rise in the arterial blood pressure is known as hypertension. The normal pressure in a healthy individual is 120/80mmHg. But increase in the blood pressure beyond 140/90mmHg is referred to as hypertension. High blood pressure can harm the vital organs. It compels the heart to work excessively, due to which congestive heart disease may set in. (ii) Coronary heart disease : (CAD) : It is also known as atherosclerosis. It affects the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart muscles. This is due to the deposition of fat, cholesterol and Ca+ and fibrous tissues on the walls of the arteries which results in the narrowing of the arterial lumen. (iii) Angina : It is also known as ""angina pectoris"" The symptom is acute chest pain. When adequate quantity of oxygen do not reach the heart muscles pain occurs. (iv) Heart failure : It is the state of heart which is not able to pump the blood effectively enough to meet the body needs. As congestion of the lungs is the main reason for this heart failure it is also known as congestive heart failure  "
Discuss briefly about any one neurotransmitter.,"We sense the changes in our environment (both internal and external) with the help of special sensory receptors. These environmental changes, called stimuli, once detected by the special sensory cells, are conveyed to the brain in the form of nerve impulses. The meaning of each stimulus is interpreted in the brain and appropriate order is sent to the body parts for its appropriate response to ensure well being."
Which type of sensory receptor are eyes and ears made up of?,They are made up of the special sensory receptors called the photoreceptors and the auditory receptors respectively.
What is the main function of the simple sensory receptors?,"Simple sensory receptors associated with general senses keep the central nervous system well informed about what is happening, both deep within the body and on its surface."
Explain what do mean by chemoreceptors?,"(i) At the posterior pole of the eye, lateral to the eye blind spot, there is a yellowish pigmented spot called macula ineta with a shallow depression called the fovea. (ii) It is a thinned-out portion of the retina that is devoid of rods and blood vessels and has cones cells only. It is the place of most distinct vision.  "
Why locomotion is helpful to animals?,"Locomotion is helpful to animals and enables them to: (i) shift from unfavourable environment to favourable conditions. (ii) go in search of food, water and shelter. (iii) find its partner for reproduction and proper place for laying eggs or giving birth to young ones. (iv) Prevents from getting captured by predators."
What do you understand by threshold stimulus for muscle contraction?,"(i) For contraction, muscle fibre always require a specific minimum strength or intensity of the stimulus or nerve impulse. This is called threshold stimulus. (ii) If the stimulus or the nerve impulse is below this intensity the muscles fail to contract."
Write about the two types of endoskeleton in humans.,"The two types of endoskeleton are: (i) Axial skeleton: It is present on the median longitudinal axis of the body. It consists of skull, vertebral column, sternum and ribs. (ii) Appendicular skeleton: It is situated at the lateral sides which actually extends outwards from the principal axis. It consists of pectoral and pelvic girdles and bones of arms and legs."
What are the functions of skull?,The important functions of skull are: (i) It protects the brain by keeping it in the cranium. (ii) It bears jaws which help the animal for cutting and masticating the food. (iii) It also protects and supports the sense organs. (iv) It provides the rigid walls of a respiratory passage through which air is inhaled into the lungs.
How locomotion is different from movement?,"The movement of an individual from one place to another is called locomotion. It includes walking running, crawling, hopping, flying or, swimming. Movement is movement of body parts with respect to the body axis. "
"Describe the functions of skeleton system,","Functions of skeleton system: (i) It forms framework for the body. (ii) It gives shape and posture to the body. (iii) The bones of the skeletal system protects delicate internal organs of the body.  (iv) It provides attachment surface for the body muscle, tendons and other similar things and thus helps in movement. (v) With its help locomotion is performed."
Mention the bones which form limbs.,"The bones which make up arm are: 1 humerus, 1 radius, 1 ulna, 8 carpal bones, 5 metacarpal, 5 digits (14 phalanges). The bones which make up leg are: 1 femur, 1 tibia, 1 fibula, 1 patella (knee cap), 7 tarsal bones, 5 metatarsals, 5 digits (14 phalanges)."
What is the role of girdles in the skeleton?,"There are two girdles: pectoral and pelvic. (i) Apart from providing the glenoid cavity for articulating with the head of humerus, the pectoral girdle provides surface for attachment of the arm muscles. (ii) In addition of providing articulation with the legs, the pelvic girdle supports the posterior region of the trunk. It also provides surface for the attachment of the muscles of legs."

Explain the role of intercostal muscles in respiration.,"(i) The contraction of the external intercostal muscles and diaphragm increases the volume of the thoracic cavity and lowers the pressure in the lungs. (ii) To fill up this gap, the fresh air rushes to the lungs resulting in the inspiration. (iii) The relaxation of the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles returns the diaphragm and sternum to their normal positions and decreases the volume of the thoracic cavity and subsequently, pressure in the lungs increases. (iv) To equalise this pressure, the air from the lungs rushes out through the respiratory passage to bring out expiration."
State the route of foul air from the lungs to the outside ?,The route followed by foul air from the lungs to outside is as follows: Alveoli → Alveolar duct Bronchioles → Bronchi → Trachea → Larynx → Glottis → Pharynx → Internal nares → Nasal chambers → External nares → Atmosphere.
How does air play a vital role in the production of voice ? On what factors the quality of sound depends ?,"Sound is produced by the vocal cords. When expired air is passed through the true vocal cords under pressure from the lungs, the vocal cords are set into vibration which results in the production of sound. Factors: The pitch of a sound is determined by the tension on the vocal cords-the greater the tension, the higher the pitch. The quality of voice depends on the resonators above the larynx, namely the pharynx, mouth and paranasal sinuses. "
Inspiratory muscles and expiratory muscles play very important role in respiratory process. (DDE 2017),The contraction of the external inter costal muscles and diaphragm leads to increase in volume of thoracic cavity. An increase in pulmonary volume decreases the intra-pulmonary pressure to less than atmospheric pressure. Thus forcing air into the lungs from outside. This is inspiration. Relaxation of the diaphragm and the inter-costal muscles returns the diaphragm and the sternum to their normal positions and reduce the thoracic volume and thereby the pulmonary volume. This lead to an increase in intra-pulmonary pressure in comparison to the atmospheric pressure. This causes expiration.
What are the two factors that contribute towards the dissociation of oxyhaemoglobin in the arterial blood to release molecular oxygen in an active tissue?,"The two factors that contributes towards the dissociation of oxyhaemoglobin in the arterial blood to release molecular oxygen in an active tissue are, (i) Lower concentration of pO 2 and (ii) Higher concentration of pCO 2."
What is partial pressure ? how does it help in gaseous exchange during respiration ?,"The pressure exerted by an individual gas in a mixture of gases is called partial pressure. It is directly proportional to its concentration in a mixture It is expressed as PO 2, PCO2, etc. A gas diffuses across a membrane from the side where its partial pressure is higher to the side where it is lower. In lungs, PO 2 is higher in alveolar air than in blood capillaries, so O2 diffuses from lungs into the blood. Sometime PCO 2 is higher in blood than in alveoli and hence it diffuses out."

Oxyhaemoglobin : Oxygen diffuses into erythrocytes and combines with the iron ions of haemoglobin and forms oxyhaemoglobin  "
Write short notes on hind brain. ,"The structural classification of neurons depends upon the number of dendrites extending from the cell body. (i) Multipolar neurons have one axon and several dendrites; the majority of neurons in the spinal cord and brain are multipolar. (ii) Bipolar neurons have only two processes: a single dendrite and an axon. Biopolar neurons are found in the sense organs-and in the retina of the eye and in olfactory cells. (iii) Unipolar neurons lack dendrites and have a single axon, and are also sensory neurons."
What are the different parts of fore brain?,The nervous system of higher animals performs three basic functions: (i) They receive sensory input from internal and external environment by nerves. (ii) They process the input information; and (iii) They respond to the stimuli transmitting motor commands to determine the response of the body parts or cells.
In how many parts human nervous system is divided?,"(i) Hypothalamus integrates and controls the visceral activities. (ii) It maintains homeostasis. (iii) It provides anatomical connection between the nervous and endocrine systems by its relationship to the pituitary gland. (iv) Hypothalamus is thermoregulatory centre. Hence it is called ""thermostat"" of the body. It keeps body temperature at roughly 37°C by means of a complex thermostat system. (v) It is also associated with behavioural activities. (vi) Appetite and thirst centres are located in the hypothalamus."
"What is the difference between unipolar, bipolar and multipolar neurons? Give one example of each.","Middle ear: The middle ear contains three ossicles called malleus, incus and stapes which are attached to one another in a chain-like fashion. The malleus is attached to the  tympanic membrane and the stapes is attached to the oval window of the cochlea. The ear ossicles increase the efficiency of transmission of sound waves to the inner ear. Eustachian tube help in equalising the pressure of either side of ear drum."
Name the two humours found inside the mammalian eye. List the functions they perform.,"The path travelled by an impulse in a reflex action is called the reflex arc. It consists of five parts: (i) A receptor or skin, the neurons of which start a sensory impulse. (ii) An afferent nerve, which brings sensory impulse from the receptor to the central nervous system. (iii) The neurons present in the spinal cord change the sensory impulse into the motor impulse. (iv) An efferent nerve, which carries the motor impulses from the spinal cord to the specific effectors like muscles fibres or gland cells. (v) An effector, where impulse terminates and response is given."
What is meant by 'reflex action'? Give one example. Name the components of a reflex arc in proper sequence from the receptor upto the effector., 
Where does mitosis take place in plants and animals? What is its significance in multicellular organisms?. ,"It takes place both in somatic and reproductive cells of the plants and animals. In multicellular organisms, mitosis produces more cells for growth and repair. Mitosis division is responsible for growth and development of a single-celled zygote into a multicellular organism. Mitosis division helps in maintaining the proper size. Mitosis also helps in restoring wear and tear in body tissues, replacing damaged or lost part, healing wounds and regeneration of detached parts."
Draw a labelled diagram of anaphase of mitosis. Write any two key features of this phase.   ,"Two key features are: (i) Fibres uniting chromosomes with poles of spindle starts contraction until daughter chromosomes are completely distinct from one another. Contraction of fibres pulls the groups of chromosomes further apart to their respective poles. (ii) The chromosomes move to their poles through cytoplasm.  Fig. The behaviours of chromosomes at late anaphase n relation to chromosomal, polar and interzonal spindle fibres"
(i) What is meant by cytokinesis? (ii) How cytokinesis in plants differ from that in animals?  (iii) With reference to the cell types undergoing mitosis differentiate between animal cells and plant cells.,"(i) Cytokinesis is the cytoplasmic division of a cell at the end of mitosis or meiosis, which bring about the separation into two daughter cells. (ii) In animal cell, division of cytoplasm likes by cleavage while in plant cell, division of cytoplasm takes place by cell-plate formation. (iii) In plants & new cell wall is fashioned between the new daughter cells, while in animal cells the cell membrane constricts to pinch the parent cell into daughter cells."
What are the factors controlling cell division?,"Factors controlling cell division are: (i) Cell size: Cells capable of division attain a particular size and then undergo division. (ii) Karyoplasmic ratio: Rise in cell volume disturbs karyoplasmic ratio. It stimulates the cell to divide. (iii) Mitogens: Mitogens, are agents, factors or substances that trigger cell division."
"Differentiate between (i) S-phase and G2 phase, (ii) G1 phase and G2 phase.","(i) Meiosis: Meiosis is a double division that takes place in a diploid cell (2N) and involves reduction of chromosome number to half and forms four haploid cells. It reduces number of chromosomes to half. So it is popularly termed as the reduction division.  (ii) Amitosis : It is a simple method of cell division, also called direct cell division. In this, there is no differentiation of chromosomes and spindle. Nuclear envelope does not degenerate. Nucleus elongates and constricts in middle to form two daughter nuclei. It is followed by a centripetal constriction of cytoplasm to form 2 daughter cells. (iii) G2 phase (second growth phase) : It is also called pre-mitotic gap phase. It has double DNA content as compared to original cell (4C:2C). It produces macromolecules (RNAs, proteins) for multiplication of organelles, spindle formation and cell growth. G phase prepares a cell to undergo division."
Explain anaphase of mitosis briefly.   ,"Anaphase of Mitosis: (i) It begins by division of centromere. (ii) Fibres uniting chromosomes with poles of spindle begin contracting until daughter chromosomes are completely distinct from one another. (iii) Contraction of fibres pulls the groups of chromosomes further apart to their respective poles. (iv) Contraction of fibres and separation of two groups of chromosomes is very rapid. (v) The chromosomes move to their poles through cytoplasm. (vi) They assume characteristic V-, J- or I-shaped configuration. The centromere may be in centre or away from it or may be at terminal end. For diagram : Refer to SAQ-11/Q.2"
How do cytokinesis takes place in plants?,"In plants cytokinesis takes by two methods: (a) Cleavage method: This method occurs in lower plants. Cytoplasm undergo centripetal constriction in the middle to form two daughter protoplasts, each having a single nucleus. In furrow, pectin hemicellulose and microfibrils of cellulose are deposited to form a double wall. (b) Cell plate method: In this case, the spindle persists for some time, known as phragmoplast. Small vesicles produced by golgi apparatus collect at the equator of the phragmoplast. The membrane of vesicles fuse to form film which solidifies to form cell plate."
What is the necessity of meiosis II in meiosis inspite of the reduction division of meiosis I?,"At the end of Meiosis-I, two groups of chromosomes are produced, with each group having half the number of chromosomes present in the parent nucleus, therefore meiosis-I is called reductional division. But each chromosome is still a dyad i.e., formed of two sister chromatids joined at the common centromere. Though the chromosome number has been halved, each chromosome still has double (2N) amount of DNA. So there is need of meiosis-II during which sister chromatids of  each chromosome separate into different cells. Haploidy occurs even in DNA amount. The main purpose of meiosis-II is to separate genetically chromosomes formed during crossing over in meiosis-I."
Explain diakinesis of meiosis I division.,"Three events responsible for gametic consequences during meiosis are: (i) The pairing of the homologous chromosomes (ii) The process of crossing over and recombination, and (iii) The segregation of homologous chromosomes.  "
