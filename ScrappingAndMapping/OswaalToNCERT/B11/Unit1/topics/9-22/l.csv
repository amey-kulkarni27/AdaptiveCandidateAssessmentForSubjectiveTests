Explain Van Niel experiment on purple and green sulphur bacteria.,"Van Niel on his studies with purple and green sulphur bacteria doemonstrated that photosynthesis is a light dependent reaction in which hydrogen from an oxidisable compound reduces CO2 to form sugar. 2H2 A + CO2 ‚Üí  ùëôùëñùëî‚Ñéùë°  2A + CH2 O  In Green plants, HO is the hydrogen donor and is oxidised to O2 In green sulphur bacteria, when H2 O instead of HO was used as hydrogen donor no O2 was evolved. He inferred that O2 evolved by green plants come from H2 O but not from C O2"
Explain the photochemical phase of photosyn-thesis. What is the light reaction product. ,"The photochemical phase : this phase of involve all those events which require sunlight. A photon absorbed by the molecules of the trapping or harvesting aone of P'S Iand PS II pass their energy to their respective reacion centre.  For pigment system 1 the light energy is gathered by cholorphyill a, and posibly by chlerophyll b, while for PS II ight energy is gathered by chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and phycobillins. Arnon et al (1954) discovered that in addition to carrying out Hill reaction the choloroplast also synthesize ATP in presence of light from ADP and inorganic phosphate. This process is called as photophosphorylation. "
Under high concentration of ùêéùüê RuBP binds with ùêéùüê and forms one molecule of phosphoglycerate and phosphoglycolate.,"Non-cyclic photophosphorylation: (i) It takes place in the grana of chloroplasts. (ii) The process initiates with excitation of special types of chlorophyll molecules P680 and P700 (The letter Pstands for pigment and the figures for the wavelength of light at which these molecules absorb). (iii) P 680 and P700, molecules of chlorophyll form the reaction centres or photocentres. (iv) The accessory pigments and other chlorophyll molecules harvest the solar energy and pass it on to the reaction centres. (v) Thus, a photon absorbed anywhere in the molecules harvest the solar energy and pass its on to the P680 molecule. (vi) The cluster of pigment molecules which transfer their energy to P 680 absorb at or below the wavelength of 680 nm. (vii) Together with P 680 they form the photosystem II or PS II. Similarly P700 forms photosystem I or PS I along with pigment molecules which absorb at or below 700 nm. (viii) When P680 acquires a sufficient quantum of energy, it emits an electron, This electron with high potential energy moves down an electron transport chain and during this process ATP is formed. (ix) The electron lost from P 680 is ultimately compensated by P700 which transfers it to ferredoxin (an iron-containing protein). In turn, ferredoxin transfers the electron to NADP to generate NADPH. (x) As synthesis of ATP occurs in light and the process is not cyclic ùëñ. ùëí., the same not coming back to the oxidised photosystem or in other words, it needs a constant su of water molecules to be oxidised and NADP to be reduced, the process is called non-cyclic photophosphorylation."
Esplain chemiosmotic bypothests briefly.,"The chemiosmotic hypothesis has been put forward to explain thse machanism of ATP synthesis in the chloroplast, ATE synthests is linked to the development of pruton gradient actoss the membranes of the thylakoid. (i) Since splitting of the water molecule takes place on the inner side of the thylakoid membrane the protons produced by the photolysis of water accuimulates within the lumen of the thylakoids.  (ii) As electrons move through the photosystems, protons are transported across the membrane. (iii) This occur because the primary acceptor ot electron which is located towards the outer side of the membrane transfers its electrons to an hydrogen carrier. Hence this molecule removes a proton from the stroma while transporting an electron. (iv) When this molecule passes on its electron to the electron carrier on the inner side of the membrane, the proton is released into the lumen side of the membrane. (v) The NADP teductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the membrane. Along with electrons that come from the acceptor of electrons of PSl, protons are also needed to reduce NAD+ to NADPH + H + and so these protons are also removed from the stroma. (vi) As a result, protons in the stroma decrease in number, while in the lumen it increases, thus creating a proton gradient across the thy≈Çakoid membrane. (vi) This gradientis important because the breakdown of this gradient leads to release of energy. The gradient is broken down due to the facilitated diffusion of protons across the membrane to the stroma through F0 part of ATP ase. (vii) The other portion of ATP synthetase called F1 undergoes conformational change due to the energy produced by the breakdown of proton gradient which enables the enzyme to synthesize several ATP. "
What is photorespiration 7 How do some plants like sugafcane minimize the photorespiratory loss? Explain  ,"Photorespiration : It is light dependent process of oxygenation of ribulose biphosphate (RuBP) and release of carbon dioxide by the photosynthetic organs of a plant. The photorespiratory losses are checked by sugarcane by having physiological adaptations The process of photosynthests occurs in mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells. Mesophyll cells : (i) Initially, CO2 in taken up by phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) and changed to oxaloacetate (OAA) in the presence of PEP carboxylase (PEPCO). (ii) Oxaloacetate is reduced to malate/aspartate, the product formed reach into bundle sheath. Bundle Sheath : (i) The oxidation of malate (an aspartate) occurs with release of carbon dioxide and formation of pyruvate (3C). (iii) Due to increased CO2 concentration, the RuBisco function as carboxylase and not as oxygenase. (iv) This prevents the photosynthetic losses. (v) RuBP operates now under Calvin cycle and pyruvates transported back to mesophyil cells changed into phosphoenol pyruvate, to keep the cycle going."
What are the products of light reaction ? Name first stable product of C3 plants Explain different steps of calvin cycle.,"ATP and NADPH, the product of light reaction are used in synthesis of food. The first CO2 fixation product in C3 Plants is 3-phosphoglyceric acid. The CO2 acceptor is RuBP. Calvin cycle has three stages: (i) Carboxylation : CO2 + RuBP ‚Üí 2 molecule of PGA. (ii) Reduction : Glucose is formed at the expense of ATP and NADPH It involves 2 ATP for phosphorylation and 2 NADPH2 for reduction per CO2 molecule fixed. (iii) Regeneration : RuBP is formed again. 6 turns of Calvin cyde and 18 ATP molecules are required to synthesize one molecule of glucose For diagram: Refer to SAQ-IIL/Q.14.6 CO2 + 6RuBP + 18 ATP + 12NADPH-C6 H12 O6 + 6 RuBP + 18ADP +18Pi + 12NADP."
What are the external and internal factors affecting photosynthesis ?,"The external and internal factors affecting photosynthesis are: (i) External factors: (a) Light : The quality, intensity and duration of light received by plants greatly influences the rate of photosynthesis. The quality of light influence the photosynthesis as blue and red regions of the visible spectrum are most effective. Green light has minimum effect. When sufficient intensity of light is available, they starts performing photosynthesis. Rate of photosynthesis increase proportionately with an increase in light intensity till plants achieve light saturation point. Beyond this point photosynthesis does show any change. Longer exposure to continuous light favours good photosynthesis. (b) Carbon dioxide : CO2 concentration in atmosphere act as a limiting factor. An increase in CO2 come upto 0.1% shows an increase in photosynthesis. Higher conc. becomes toxic and inhibit the rate of photosynthesis. (c) Oxygen : High concentration of usygen has an inhibitory effect on photosynthesis in C3 plants, because RuBP oxygenase becomes more active resulting in photorespiration. (d) Water: Its photooxidation supplies H + for the reduction of NADP. The reduced NADP H2 is used in the reduction of CO2 in Calvin cycle. It also donates the electrons to P680 in non-cyclic photophosphorylation. (e) Temperature: Rate of photosynthesis doubles with every 100 C rise in temperature till the optimum value is achieved. An increase in temperature above 300 C results in a fall in the rate of photosynthesis. The optimum temperature for photosynthesis in C3 plants is 10-2 50 C and in C4 plants it is 30450 C. (ii) Internal factors:  (a) Chlorophyll content: Chlorophyll is essential for cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation and reduction of NADP, the ssimilatory power, used to fix and reduce CO2 in Calvin cycle. (b) Leaf anatomy: The important anatomical features that influence photosynthesis include thickness of cuticle, stomatal index, distribution of stomata, degree of opening of stomata, size and distribution of intercellular spaces and number and distribution of vascular strands. Kranz anatomy of C4 plants increases the efficiency of photosynthesis. (c) Age of leaf: As leaf develops, the rate of its photosynthesis increases gradually reaching maximum when the leaf becomes fully matured. Rate of photosynthesis decreases with age of leaf."
Name the three cellular organelles that are involved in photorespiration. Mention the various steps of photorespiratory pathway. Name the cell organelles involved in photorespiration. Explain the mechanism of this process. ,"Chloroplast, perosisome and mitochondria are three celilar organelles invalved in photurespiration. Varinus steps of photorespiratory pathway : (a) In presence ut high O2 RuBP cartovylase acts as oxygenase and resuts in formation of 3PGA Phosphoglyceric arid) and 2-phosphoglyoolate 2-phosphoglycolate loses P O4 igoup to make glycolate. (b) Siynthesized glycolate in chlomptest enters into peroxisome.  (c) The glycolate is oxidised into glyosylate and H2 O2 by oxidase enzyme. (d) Clyoxylate is changed into glycine (amino acid) by glutamate glyoxylate transaminase (enzyme). (e) Two molecules of glycine form serine and one mol. of CO2 in mitochondria but no ATP and NADPH are formed. (f) Finally serine passes into mitochondria and is changed into carbohydrate (3 carbon) and Phosp≈Çtoglycolate (2 carbon). (g) Soon glycolate is formed by phosphoglycolate. In peroxisomes, glycolate soon changes into glycine and glycine into serine and CO2 without production of assimilatory powers (ATP and NADP H2 )."
How is CAM completed in two phases ? Explain.,"Crassulacean acid metabolism occurs in succulent plants and gets completed in two phases: Phase 1: (i) Stomata are open at night. CO2 is absorbed from outside. With the help of PEP carboxylase, it is immediately fixed. (ii) The acceptor is Phosphoenol pyruvate or PEP. PEP Carboxylase  PEP + –ù–°O3 (–°O2 + H2 O) ‚Üí  Dehydregenase  Oxaloacetic acid + NADPH ‚Üí  Oxaloacetic acid + H3 PO4 Malic acid + NADP +  (iii) Malic acid is end product of dark fixation of C O2 It is stored inside cell vacuoles. Phase II: (i) During day time, stomata are closed. However, light is available for photosynthesis. (ii) Malic acid moves out of the cell vacuoles. (iii) It is decarboxylated with the help of malic enzyme. (iii) Pyruvate is produced and is metabolised.  (iv) The released CO2 is fixed again through Calvin cycle with the help of RuBP and Rubisco. (v) Crassulacean plants have developed a unique mechanism to perform photosynthesis without much lose of water."
Describe calvin cycle by flow chart.,   
Where does glycolysis occur in cell? Describe the sequence of reactions in it. Mention the end product. ,"Glycolysis: Glycolysis means ""the splitting of sugar"". A glucose molecule is converted into 2 molecules of pyruvic acid during glycolysis. It occurs in cytoplasm of the cell. Sequence of reactions is Glycolysis: Step 1: The enzyme hexokinase phosphorylates (adds a phosphate group to) glucose in the cell's cytoplasm. In the process, a phosphate group from ATP is transferred to glucose producing glucose 6-phosphate.  Step 2: The enzyme phosphohexo seisomerase converts glucose 6-phosphate into its isomer fructose 6-phosphate.  Step 3: The enzyme phosphofructokinase uses another ATP molecule to transfer a phosphate group to from fructose 1, 6-phosphate. Step 4: The enzyme aldolase splits fructose 1, 6 bisphosphate into two sugars that are isomers of each other. These two sugars are dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde phosphate.  Step 5: The enzyme triose phosphate isomerase rapidly inter-converts the molecules dihydroxyacetone phosphate into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is removed as soon as it is formed to be used in the next step of glycolysis.  Step 6: The enzyme triose phosphate dehydrogenase serves two functions in this step. First the enzyme transfers a hydrogen (H-) from glyceraldehyde phosphate to the oxidizing agent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) to form NADH. Next triose phosphate dehydrogenase adds a phosphate (P) from the cytosol to the oxidized glyceraldehyde phosphate to form 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate. This occurs for both molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced in step 5.  Step 7: The enzyme phosphoglycerokinase transfers a P from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to a molecule of ADP to form ATP This happens for each molecule of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. The process yields two 3-phosphoglycerate molecules and two ATP molecules. Step 8: The enzyme phosphoglyceromutase relocates the P from 3-phosphoglycerate from the third carbon to the second carbon to form 2-phosphoglycerate.  Step 9: The enzyme enolase removes a molecule of water from 2- phosphoglycerate to form phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). This happens for  Step 10: The enzyme pyruvate kinase transfers a P from PEP to ADP to form pyruvate and ATP. This happens for each molecule of phosphoenolpyruvate + pyruvate kinase+2 ADP2 molecules of pyruvate +2ATP. End products are 2 pyruvate molecules and 2 ATP molecules. "
Schematically represent the steps of glycolysis.  ,
What is pentose phosphate pathway? Explain the process.,"(i) It is also called as hexose monophosphate shunt, because this pathway occurs in presence of oxygen, and involves direct oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate.  (ii) In PPP for every six molecules of glucose, one is completely oxidised to CO 2 and H2O, while the other five are regenerated. Oxidation of glucose is linked to the formation of NADPH2. (iii) Glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate by ATP. (iv) Glucose 6-PO4 undergoes two dehydrogenation through a number of intermediates to yield ribulose-5-phosphate, two molecules of NADPH + H+ and a molecule of CO 2. (v) Complete oxidation of a molecule of glucose produces 12 molecules of NADPH+H +, which is equivalent to 36 ATP molecules. (vi) Thus, the energy released in the oxidation of glucose via this pathway is almost equal to that of common pathway that liberates 38 ATP molecules per molecule of glucose. Pentose phosphate pathway occurs in cytoplasm but takes the help of mitochondria for producing ATP.  "
Name and explain the three stages of cell cycle associated with interphase.  Describe the phases of cell cycle with suitable diagram.    Explain the events occurring during the cell cycle of a somatic cell. ,"Cell cycle : The three stages of cell cycle are :(i) G 1 phase, (ii) G2 phase, (ii) s phase or synthesis phase and (iii) G2 phase. The resting stage or stage between two mitotic divisions (that is at the end of prophase and beginning of prophase) is called interphase. The interphase is the longest part of mitotic cycle taking a long time for its completion. It itself consists of three phases: (i) G1 Phase : (Post-Mitotic Gap 1) (a) It includes synthesis and organization of the substrate and enzyme necessary for DNA synthesis. (b) It is marked by the transcription of r-RNA, t-RNA, m-RNA and synthesis of different protein. (c) Enlargement of nucleus. (d) Pooling of nucleotide and protein from the neighbouring cell into dividing cell. (e) The chromosomes lie in the form of more or less loosely coiled thread. (ii) S-Phase (Synthetic phase): (a) The chromosome replicate and the DNA content doubles. Each chromosome comes to have two chromatin thread. (iii) G2 Phase (Pre-Mitotic Gap 2): (a) It is the stage when rate and amount of protein synthesis is maximum. (b) It is the post DNA synthesis phase during which all the metabolic activities concerning growth of cytoplasm and its constituent cell organelle and macro-molecules are formed. (c) Highly extended coiling of chromosome marks starting of prophase. "
Enumerate the events that occur in mitosis of cell division with diagram.,"Mitosis is divided into the following four stages: (i) Prophase: (a) Chromatin material shortens and condenses into thread like structures called chromosomes. (b) Each chromosome consists of two chromatids joined at a point called centromere. (c) At the end of the prophase, the nucleolus and nuclear membrane disappear. The cellular protein content condenses into a spindle.  (ii) Metaphase: (a) A bipolar, anastral spindle develops in the cell (b) The chromosomes appear short and thick., each having two chromatids.  (c) The chromatids become clear and get attached to the poles by spindle fibres at their centromeres. (d) Chromosomes become arranged at the equator of the spindle. (iii) Anaphase: (a) The centromeres split into two and the fibres pull the daughter centromeres to the opposite poles. (b) The daughter chromosomes (with separated chromatids) appear V, J, L and I shaped depending upon the position of centromere. (iv) Telophase: (a) The chromosomes reach the poles of the cell, uncoil, lengthen and lose the ability to be seen clearly. (b) The spindle fibres disintegrate. (c) Nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear and two daughter nuclei appear at opposite poles (v) Karyokinesis is followed by cytokinesis where the following events takes place: (a) Cell plate formation takes place between the two daughter nuclei. (b) Two daughter cells are formed. "
(i) Write a note on significance of meiosis. (ii) Differentiate between anaphase I of meiosis and Anaphase of mitosis. (iii) What do you understand by Synapsis? In which stage of Prophase-I you observe it. ,"(i) Formation of gametes, Genetic variability Maintenance of chromosomal number (ii) Anaphase of mitosis Centromeres and chromatids separate; chromatids moves to opposite poles due to shortening of spindle fibres. Anaphase I of meiosis: Homologous chromosomes separate while chromatids remain associated at their centromeres. (iii) Pairing of homologous chomosomes is synapsis. It is observed during zygotene stage."
How many types of meiosis are there ? Explain.,"Depending upon the stage, when meiosis occurs, the meiosis is of three types : Gametic, zygotic and sporic. (i) Gametic or terminal meiosis : In most animals and some lower plants, meiosis takes place during the formation of gametes (gametogenesis). Such a meiosis is described as gametic or terminal meiosis. When two gametes fuse in fertilization, the diploid zygote is formed. Gametic meiosis results in diplontic life cycle. (ii) Zygotic or initial meiosis: In some lower plants meiosis takes place in the zygote and the resulting organisms are haploid. It is called zygotic or initial meiosis. Organisms having zygotic meiosis have haplontic life cycle. (iii) Sporic or intermediate meiosis: In most of the plants, meiosis occurs at the time of sporogenesis. It is called sporic or intermediate meiosis. Spore gives rise to a new gametophytic phase in the life cycle. The gametophyte produces gametes. The life of plant is said to be diplo-haplontic because of the presence of diploid and haploid multicellular phases."
Describe briefly the two phases of meiotic division.   ,"Two phases of meiotic division: (i) Meiotic cell division is divided into two phasesMeiosis I and Meiosis II. (ii) In the meiotic I division, the homologous chromosomes pair to form bivalents. Exchange of genetic material takes place. (iii) The chromosomes now separate and get distributed into daughter cells. (iv) Prophase I is divided into five sub-stages : Leptotene, Zygotene, Pachytene, Diplotene and Diakinesis. (v) During Metaphase I, the bivalents get arranged on equatorial plate with their arms on the plate but the centromere is directed towards opposite pole. It is followed by Anaphase I.  (vi) Now the homologous chromosomes repel each other, and move to the opposite poles with both their chromatids. (vii) In this way each pole gets half the chromosomes number of the parent cell. (viii) In telophase I, the nuclear envelope and nucleolus again appear. Meiosis II is quite similar to mitosis. (ix) The centromere of each chromosome breaks, separating the chromatids, one each to a daughter cell.  (x) The meiotic cell division maintains the chromosome number of a species. (xi) As a result of meiotic division, the four daughter cells are formed with half the chromosome number (haploid) in each cell."
What is the significance of meiosis?,Significance of Meiosis: (i) Formation of gametes: Meiosis produces gametes that are essential for sexual reproduction. (ii) Maintenance of chromosome number: Meiosis maintains the chromosome number constant in sexually reproducing organisms. It is essential since the chromosome number is doubled after fertilization. (iii) Introduction of variation: Meiosis introduces variation in the organisms due to crossing over and random distribution of paternal and maternal chromosomes. (iv) Mutations: Chromosomal and genomatic: mutations can take place by irregularities of meiotic divisions. Some of the mutations may be advantageous to the organism and are perpetuated by natural selection. (v) Genetic information: It switches on genetic information for the development of gametes or gametophyte and switches off the sporophytic information. (vi) Evidence of basic relationship of organisms: Details of meiosis are essentially similar in the majority of organisms showing their basic similarities and relationship
Describe the sub-phases of prophase I of meiosis I    Describe prophase-I in detail with diagrams.   ,"Prophase I of meiosis I : It is more complicated and prolonged as compared to the similar stag of mitosis. It may be divided into the five sub- phases (i) Leptotene or leptonema: (a) It is the first stage of meiotic division following the interphase. (b) The chromatin fibres of interphase nucleus gets shorten and elongated, chromosomes become clear. (ii) Zygotene or zygonema: (a) The homologous chromosomes come to lie side by side and get attached laterally due to the development of nucleoprotein between them. This pairing of homologous chromosomes is called synapsis or syndesis. (d) On account of synapsis, chromosomes form pairs or bivalent. The number of bivalents is half number of the chromosomes. (iii) Pachytene or pachynema: (a) The paired chromosomes or bivalent become short and thick. The chromatids of each paired chromosome slightly separate and become visible. Thus, each bivalent or chromosome pair is made up of actually four chromatids, two of each chromosome. (b) Each group of four chromatids, is referred as tetrad. During pachytene, exchange of the corresponding segments of non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes, occurs. This process is called crossing over. (c) After crossing over, the two chromatids of a chromosome become dissimilar.  (iv) Diplotene or Diplonema : (a) The nucleoprotein fusion complex of the synapsed chromosomes dissolves. (b) The homologous chromosomes tart separating except in the region of crossing over. (c) The points of attachment between the homologous chromosomes are called chiasmata. (v) Diakinesis: (a) This is marked by terminalisation of chiasmata. During this phase the chromosomes are fully condensed and the meiotic spindle is assembled to prepare the homologous chromosomes for separation. The nucleolus/ nucleoli disappear and Nuclear envelope breaks down into vesicles. "
Explain meiosis II in an animal cell.,"Meiosis II happen in the two haploid nuclei simultaneously. (i) Prophase II: It takes short time. Spindle formation begins and the chromosomes become short. Two chromatids are joined to a single centromere. Nuclear membrane and nucleolus disintegrate. (ii) Metaphase II : At the equator, the chromosomes lie and spindle is formed. The centromere of every chromosome is joined to the spindle fibre. Then centromere also divides. (iii) Anaphase II : The daughter chromosomes are formed. Chromatids move towards their poles with the spindle fibres.  (iv) Telophase II: Reaching at the poles chromosomes form nuclei which are haploid (N) daughter nuclei. Again nuclear membrane is constructed. Nucleolus is clearly visible.  Cytokinesis: The cytokinesis occurs and four daughter cells are formed which are haploid (N). It may occur once or twice (i.e., in Meiosis I and Meiosis or only after the meiosis ‚Ö° cell division).  "
Explain the structure of human lungs in detail.,"(i) The lungs are soft, spongy and elastic organs, pinkish in colour. (ii) The upper most portion of lungs is called the apex and the inferior portion is called the base. (iii) The left lung is smaller than the right lung. (iv) Each lung is enclosed by two membranes called the ùëùùëôùëíùë¢ùëüùëé. (v) The outer membrane is called parietal pleura and the inner membrane is known as visceral pleura. (vi) A narrow space between the two pleura is filled with pleural fluid. (vii) The left lung has two lobes: superior and inferior lobes. (viii) The right lung has three lobes: superior, middle and inferior lobe. (ix) The trachea at its lower bifurcates into a pair of primary bronchi which enter the right and left lungs. (x) As soon as primary branches enters each lung it divides to form secondary bronchi.  (xi) These bronchi also have cartilaginous rings. (xii) The tertiary bronchi sub-divides into smaller branches, the bronchioles. (xiii) Each terminal bronchioles give rise to a number of very thin, irregular walled and vascularised bag like structures called alveoli.  Fig. Tracheal division upto tertiary bronchi"
Why is it not healthy to breath in a closed room in winters where a large number of persons are sitting near an angithi ?,In a closed room there is no provision of fresh air coming into the room. The oxygen already present in the air of that room shall be gradually consumed. Moreover if more number of people are sitting in that room the percentage of oxygen will go on decreasing and the percentage of carbon dioxide will go on increasing by continuous use of oxygen during respiration. If in such a room there is angithi also then it is positively harmful for the persons sitting in the room. It is because burning of coal or wood in the angithi would consume oxygen very rapidly. Also it produce poisonous gases like carbon monoxide in addition to carbon dioxide.
Give a detail account on respiratory capacities.,"The quantities of air the lungs can receive, hold or expel under different conditions are called pulmonary volumes. Many pulmonary volumes are collectively known as respiratory capacities. (i) Inspiratory Capacity (IC): It is the total volume of air that can be inhaled after a normal expiration. It includes tidal volume plus the inspiratory reserve volume. (IC = TV + IRV). It is normal about 3000 to 3500 ml of air. (ii) Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) : When a person breathes normally the amount which remains in the lung after normal expiration is called functional residual capacity. It is  the sum total of residual volume and the expiratory reserve volume (FRC RV+ERV). It is about 2500 ml of air. (iii) Vital Capacity (VC) : It is the amount of air which one can inhale and exhale after a forced expiration and after a forced inspiration respectively. It varies from 3.5-4.5 litres in a normal adult person. It is the sum total of TV, IRV and ERV. (iv) Total Lung Capacity (TLC): It is the total amount of air present in the lungs, and the respiratory passage after a maximum inspiration. It is the sum of the vital capacity and the residual volume. (TLC = VC + RV). It is 5000 to 6000 ml."
"Explain why the following things happen: (i) The more oxygen is released from oxyhaemoglobin in a more active tissue than in a less active one. (ii) Oxygenation of blood promotes the release of carbon dioxide from the blood in the lungs. (iii) Oxygen leaves the blood from tissue capillaries, out carbon dioxide enters the blood in tissue capillaries. (iv) Erythrocytes can carry out anaerobic metabolism only. (v) Gaseous exchanges continue in the lungs. without interruption even during expiration.","(i) The more oxygen is released from oxyhaemoglobin in a more active tissue because its partial oxygen pressure is lower than the least active tissue. The lower pO 2 in the active tissue causes the dissociation of oxyhaemoglobin to release sufficient oxygen required by the tissues. (ii) The CO 2 from the tissue is carried in the blood in three different forms; bicarbonate in plasma and erythrocytes, carbamino-haemoglobin in erythrocytes and small amounts of dissolved carbon dioxide in plasma. On reaching the lungs blood is oxygenated. It donates H+ which joins bicarbonate (HCOs) to form carbonic acid. This carbonic acid cleaves into H2Oand CO2 by carbonic anhydrase. In this way the CO 2 is released from the carbaminohaemoglobin. The oxygen affinity of haemoglobin also gets enhanced with the fall in the blood pCO 2 resulting from the elimination of CO 2 from the blood in the lungs. (iii) The blood in the tissue capillaries contains higher pO2 than the tissue fluid. So, oxygen is released from oxyhaemoglobin and diffuse from the capillary blood to the tissue fluid and finally to the cells to the tissue fluid to raise its pCO 2 than the capillary blood. This enables carbon dioxide to diffuse from the tissue fluid to the capillary blood. (iv) Erythrocytes lack mitochondria and respiratory enzymes to perform the process of aerobic respiration. Therefore, they undergo anaerobic respiration to carry out anaerobic metabolism only. (v) Gaseous exchange continues in the lungs continuously because some air remains inside the lungs even after deepest exhalation. This air is called as residual volume which never get drived out and this is sufficient to proceed gaseous exchange without any interruption. "
What is a respiratory centre ? What is its use in the process of respiration ?,"Respiration is controlled by a respiratory centre located in the floor of the medulla oblongata of the brain. The centre is bilateral and its two halves are connected together by commissural neurons. The sides of this centre are connected with motor respiratory neurons. The nerve cells of the centre are connected with the breathing apparatus forming a reflex arc. These nerve cells are sensitive to chemical composition of blood. Half of the respiratory centre is an inspiratory centre and the other half is an expiratory centre. These two centres control the entire breathing in man with his knowledge about it. Dorsal respiratory group, ventral respiratory group and pneumotaxic groups act as respiratory centres in the brain.  "
Explain the histology of human gut.,The alimentary canal consists of four basic layers. From the outer surface inward to the lumen (cavity) the layers are as follows: (i) Serosa: (a) It is the outer most layer made up of a thin mesothelium with some connective tissues. (ii) Muscularis: (a) It is composed of outer longitudinal and inner circular muscle fibres. (b) In the stomach an additional layer of oblique muscle fibres is found inner to the circular muscle fibres. (iii) Submucosa: It consists of loose connective tissue richly supplied with blood and lymphatic vessels and in some areas with glands. (iv) Mucosa: It is named so because it secretes mucus to lubricate the inner lining of the gut. 
Explain the types and functions of glands associated with alimentary canal.,"Glands associated with alimentary canal are: (1) Salivary glands: A salivary gland may be defined as any cell or organ which discharges a secretion into the oral cavity. Human salivary glands are classified into two categories: major salivary glands and minor salivary glands. (a) Major Salivary glands: In man the major salivary glands are three pairs: parotid, sublingual and submandibular glands. (i) Parotid glands: These are the largest salivary glands which are situated near the ears. Their ducts open into the oral cavity near the upper second molars. The duct of parotid gland is called Stenson‚Äôs duct.  (ii) Sublingual glands: These are small-sized salivary glands which are located beneath the tongue and their ducts are called sublingual ducts or ducts of Rivinus. (iii) Submandibular glands: These are medium sized salivary glands which are located at the angles of the lower jaw. Their ducts open into the oral cavity near the lower central incisors. The duct of submandibular gland is called Wharton's duct. The parotid salivary glands secrete much of salivary amylase. (b) Minor salivary glands: There are numerous small glands situated in the mucous membrane of the lips (libial glands), Cheeks (buccal glands), tongue lingual glands) and palate (palatine glands). The secretions of these glands help to keep the mouth moist and provide a protective and lubricant coat of mucus. The fluids secreted by major and minor salivary glands constitute saliva. (2) Gastric glands: These are numerous microscopic, tubular glands formed by the epithelium of the stomach. The following types of cells are present in the epithelium of the gastric glands. (i) Peptic cells: (= chief or Zymogenic or Zymogen cells). They are usually basal in location and secrete gastric digestive enzymes as proenzymes or zymogens; pepsinogen and prorennin. (ii) Oxyntic cells: They are large and are most numerous on the side walls of the gastric glands They secrete hydrochloric acid and Castle‚Äôs intrinsic factor.

"Differentiate between duodenum, jejunum and ileum.","(i) Coagulation of milk in the alimentary canal: (a) When the food or milk reaches stomach, the protein digestion starts. (b) Pepsin stimulates the digestion of proteins in milk (casein). HCl activates pepsinogen into pepsin. (c) It hydrolyses soluble casein into paracasein which gets precipitated as calcium paracaseinate to make solid curd i.e., coagulation of milk. (d) There is a milk-coagulating enzyme called rennin which is found in calf gastric juice.  (e) Rennin is secreted as pro-rennin (inactive state) but in presence of HCl it is hydrolysed into active rennin. (f) Rennin hydrolyses casein into paracasein leading to milk coagulation. (ii) Digestion of starch in the alimentary canal: (a) In man and most of the other mammals, digestion starts in mouth or buccal cavity. (b) There are three pairs of salivary glands present in the mouth. These glands secrete a alkaline fluid called saliva. (c) The crushed food is mixed with saliva and is converted into a pulpy mass called bolus. (d) Saliva contains enzyme ptyalin (salivary amylase) which acts on cooked starches (polysaccharides) changing them to the disaccharide maltose. (e) Optimum pH for this reaction is 6.8. As soon as the food reaches the stomach, the ptyalin stops because of the acidic, reaction of gastric juice, pH 1.5 to 1.8. The stomach contents entering the duodenum are now called as chyme. (f) When acid chyme passes into the small intestine it is mixed first with the pancreatic juice and bile and then with the intestinal juice. (g) Pancreatic juice contains enzyme amylase which converts all digestible polysaccharides (starches) not affected by ptyalin to disaccharides (sugars). (h) Intestinal juice also contains amylase, sucrase, maltase and lactase. (i) These enzymes convert disaccharide into monosaccharides and hence digestion starch is completed."

Q. 10.. Write about some disorders of digestive system.,"Digestion is a process in which complex food materials are broken down by enzymes into simpler substances, which can be easily assimilated by the body. The pancreatic duct and bile duct open into the duodenum of the Here the food gets mixed by bile juice and pancreatic juice. Bile juice does not contain any enzyme. However, it plays an important part in digestion as it provides an alkaline medium to food and helps in emulsification of fat. The pancreatic juice contains the following enzymes, which act upon different kinds of food stuffs. (i) Trypsin, which acts on proteins and changes them to peptones. (ii) Pancreatic amylase, which acts on carbohydrates and changes them to maltose or to other complex sugars. (iii) Lipase, which acts on fats and changes them to soluble fatty acids and glycerol. The intestinal glands secrete enzymes like, (a) Erepsin, which helps to convert peptides into amino acids. (b) Maltase, which changes maltose to glucose. (c) Lactase, which changes lactose into glucose and galactose. (d) Sucrase, which changes sucrose into glucose and fructose. In this way, the digestion of food is completed in the small intestine.

Briefly describe various kinds of lipids.,"Following are the different types of lipids: (i) Simple lipids: These are esters of fatty acid with glycerol. They are of two types. (a) Neutral or true fats : These are esters of fatty acid with glycerol. They are also called glycerol. A fat molecule consists of one molecule of glycerol and one to three molecules of the same or different long-chain fatty acids.  ÔÇ∑ ÔÇ∑  Glycerol has 3 carbons, each bearing a hydroxyl (-OH) group. A fatty acid molecule is an unbranched chain of carbon atoms having a carboxylic group attached to an R group. The R group could be a methyl (-CH3) or ethyl (-C2H5 ) or higher number of -CH2 groups (C to 19-C). e.g. Palmitic acid has 16-C. Fatty acids are of two types:  ÔÇ∑ ÔÇ∑  Saturated fatty acids : These are fatty acids without double bond., e.g. Palmitic acid. Unsaturated fatty acids : These are fatty acids with one or more double bonds., e.g., oleic acids.  Neutral fats may be monoglycerides if there is only one molecule of fatty acid attached to a glycerol molecule. If the number of fatty acids attached is two then it is a diglyceride or triglyceride if it is three. (b) Waxes : These are esters of fatty acids with alcohol of high molecular weight instead of glycerol, e.g., bee wax, lanolin etc. (ii) Compound lipids : These are esters of fatty acids with alcohol, but contain same other substances also. e.g., phospholipids, glycolipids. (iii) Derived lipids such as steroids, prostaglandins etc."
Explain briefly the structural levels of proteins. Describe primary and secondary structures of proteins.    ,"Proteins are macromolecules having one or more polypeptide chains of amino acids. These are highly organised linear polymers of amino acids. Proteins have four structural levels - primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary.  (i) Primary structure : The linear sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is the primary structure of protein. The first amino acid is called N-terminus and last amino acid is called C-terminus. (ii) Secondary structure : The polypeptide chains are coiled or folded in the form of helix. The structure is maintained by a series of regularly spaced intra or inter molecular hydrogen bonds formed between the amino acids of the same or different polypeptide chains. Such a conformation is termed as secondary structure. There are 3 types of secondary structure, Œ±helix, Œ≤-pleated and collagen helix. (iii) Tertiary structure : The helical polypeptide molecules further coiled to assume a complex but specific form is called tertiary structure. They are so arranged as to hide nonpolar amino acid inside and expose the polar side chains. These structure are maintained by several types of bonds such as hydrogen bonds, vander Waal interaction, ionic bonds, disulphide bonds etc., between the polypeptide chains. (iv) Quaternary structure: Each polypeptide develops its own tertiary structure and functions as subunit of the protein. The different charged subunits pack together to give specific conformation. Large proteins such as haemoglobin have quaternary structure. It has four chains, two ùëé-chains and two ùõΩ-chains."

How Many types of synovial joints are there? Explain. ,"According to the shape and the movement, the synovial joints are of six types: (i) Gliding Joint: The articular surface of this joint are usually flat, permitting only back and forth and side to side movements. No rotation or twisting is possible because bones are tightly packed. e.g., joints between carpal and tarsal bones. (ii) Hinge joint: In this, the surface of one bone fits into the concave surface of another bone. e.g., joints in elbow, knee, ankle etc. (iii) Pivot joint: A pivot joint is a joint that allows movement in only one plane. In this rounded bone fits into a shallow depression of another bone. Ex. Joint between atlas and axis, radius and ulna. (v) Saddle joint: It allows the movement in two planes freely. The projection of one bone fits in saddle shaped depression of another bone. e.g., the joint between the carpal and metacarpal of thumb of hand.

"What is the term used for long distance movement of carbohydrates in plants ? How and in what form do the carbohydrates synthesized in the leaves, reach long distance parts in a plant? ","The food material synthesized in the leaves is translocated to the different regions of the plants through the phloem either by cytoplasmic streaming hypothesis or by mass flow hypothesis. (i) According to mass flow hypothesis proposed by Munch (1926), the translocation of food takes place from leaves to the storage organs of the plant. (ii) The food in the form of glucose is prepared by leaves by the process of photosynthesis. (iii) It increases the osmotic potential. As a result, the water from the xylem cells enters into the leaf cells by increasing turgor pressure. (iv) At the other end or in fruits and seeds, there is a low concentration of sugar which results in a low turgor and osmotic pressure. This difference in the pressure occurs on the two extreme sides i.e., on one side there are leaves and on the other side there are other organs of the plant. "
"What are the advantages and disadvantages of transpiration? ""Transpiration is a necessary evil"". Justify the statement.","Advantages of Transpiration: (i) Ascent of sap: Ascent of sap mostly occurs due to pull exerted by transpiration of water. (ii) Removal of excess water : It has been held that plants absorb far more amount of water than is actually required by them. Transpiration, therefore, removes the excess of water. (iii) Cooling effect : Radiant heat falling on the plants increases their temperature which may be dangerous to the plants. Transpiration, by evaporating water, lowers down their temperature. (iv) Mechanical tissue : The development of mechanical tissues which is essential for providing rigidity and strength to the plants, is favoured by the increase in transpiration. (v) Increasing Concentration of Mineral Salts : The sap absorbed from the soil contains low concentration of mineral salts. The loss of water through transpiration increases the concentration of mineral salts in the plant.  Disadvantages of Transpiration : (i) Wilting : Wilting or loss of turgidity is quite common during noon due to transpiration being higher than the rate of water absorption. Wilting reduces photosynthesis and other metabolic activities. (ii) Reduced Growth : Transpiration reduces availability of water inside the plant. Water deficit decreases the growth and hence the plant gives a stunted appearance. (iii) Abscissic Acid : Water stress produces abscisic acid. Abscissic acid prevents several plant processes and promotes abscission of leaves, flowers and fruits. (iv) Wastage of Energy : Since 98-99% of absorbed water is lost through transpiration, the energy used in absorption and conduction of water goes waste. (v) Modification : In order to reduce transpiration during critical periods, the plants produce several types of modification like thick cuticle, hair, prickles, spines, thons, sunken stomata, phylloclades, cladodes, etc."
Explain the mechanism of water absorption by plants.,"Plants absorb water by two distinct and independently operating methods : Passive absorption and Active absorption. (i) Passive absorption : (a) In this process, water is absorbed through the roots hairs rather than by the roots. (b) The root cells play a passive role or merely act as physical absorbing system. (c) The force for this type of water absorption originates in the aerial parts of the plant due to transpiration. It creates a tension or low water potential in the mesophyll cells of the leaves. (d) The latter, in turn, draw water from the xylem of the vascular bundle. Thus, water in the xylem is under pull or tension. It is called transpiration pull. (e) Due to the presence of continuous column of water from leaves to roots through xylem channel, the tension is transmitted to the xylem of roots and finally to root hair through endodermis and cortex. (f) Thus, a water potential gradient develops between the root hair cell and the soil solution. This results, movement of water across the root as a continuous stream. (ii) Active absorption : (a) Active absorption takes place by the activity of root itself, particularly root hairs. It utilizes metabolic energy. (b) A root hair cell functions as an osmotic system. Water is absorbed by the root hair due to osmotic differences between soil water and cell sap. (c) There exists a great difference in the osmotic pressure of the two sides or water potential gradient between the soil solution and cell sap. (d) The soil solution having less OP, has higher water potential than the cell sap with more OP. (e) Thus, water moves from the region of higher water potential towards the regions of lower water potential. (f) Water continues to enter the root hair cell as long as the water potential of the root cell sap is more negative than that of the soil solution. Water moves from cell to cell along the water potential gradient and reach up to endodermis and pericycle. (g) Finally water enters into the xylem."
Explain the mechanism of uptake of minerals by the plants.,"Plants absorb minerals as ions. The rate of mineral absorption is independent of its concentration in the soil. It has two phases, the initial phase and the metabolic phase. In  metabolic phase, the ions pass into inner space (cytoplasm and vacuole) by two methods : (a) Passive absorption (b) Active absorption. (i) Passive mineral absorption : (a) It occur by the physical processes like diffusion. Diffusion do not involve any direct expenditure of metabolic energy. (b) There are ion channels in the membrane. (c) There are transmembrane proteins, which function as selective pores for the diffusion of ions. (d) Similarly there are aquaporins for the diffusion of water. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are also transported across the membrane passively. (ii) Active mineral absorption : (a) Active transport occurs through the agency of specific carriers present in the plasma membranes of the absorbing cells. It requires energy, which is supplied by ATP. (b) The enzymes at pores present on the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells use the energy of ATP to pump protons across the membrane. This establishes an electrochemical proton gradient that supplies energy for moving ions into the cells. (c) The cells of endodermis have many transport proteins embedded in their plasma membrane. (d) The active uptake of ions is partly responsible for the water potential gradient in roots, and therefore for the uptake of water by osmosis. (e) Ions diffuse down their concentration gradient from the epidermis to the xylem.  "
What are the general functions of blood ?,"The general functions of blood are : (i) Transport of Food Materials: Blood transports the digested food from the alimentary canal to the different body cells. (ii) Transport of Respiratory Gases: Oxygen is carried from the respiratory organs to the tissues and carbon dioxide from the tissue to the respiratory organs by blood. (iii) Transport of Hormones : Hormones are carried by blood from the endocrine glands to the places of use. (iv) Transport of Excretory Matter : Blood transports the excretory matter to the kidneys or other excretory organs. (v) Transport of Heat and temperature regulation : Blood allows the transfer of heat from the deeper tissue to surface of the body where it can be lost and this help in temperature regulation. (vi) Defence against infection : Some white blood corpuscles are phagocytic in action, however certain white blood corpuscles produce antitoxins to neutralize the toxins released by the foreign germs.

Where does cardiac impulse originate ? How is it conducted to the rest of the chambers ?,"Conducting system of Human heart: (i) Human heart acts as a pumping station. The heart beat is initiated by the Sino-atrial node (SAN) which lies near the opening of the superior vena cava.  (ii) The SAN acts as a pacemaker. When it is warmed or cooled the frequency of the heart beat is increased or decreased respectively. (iii) The excitation originated at the SA is picked up by another specialized muscle fibres, the AV node in the auricular septum. (iv) From the AV node the excitation travels through the special muscle fibres present in the septum dividing in the two ventricles. (v) This conducting bundle divides into two-right and left bundle. Each branch enters the ventricles through a fine network of the Purkinje fibres. (vi) All the conducting fibres are very specialized type of muscle fibres."
Describe the structure of human heart.,"(i) The heart is composed of two types of chambers. The upper two, small, thin walled chamber are the auricles or atria and receives blood from various parts of the body and lower two large, thick walled muscular ventricles that supply blood to various body organs. (ii) The two auricles are separated by inter-auricular septum. (iii) The right atrium receives the openings of superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and coronary sinus. (iv) The opening of inferior vena cava is guarded by eustachian valve. (v) The opening of the coronary sinus has Thebasian valve. (vi) The left auriculo-ventricular valve consists of two flaps and is termed bicuspid or mitral valve. (vii) The right auriculo-ventricular valve consists of three triangular flaps and is called tricuspid valve. (ix) The right and left ventricles are separated by interventricular septum. (x) The ventricles function as pumping chambers, thus they have thick muscles walls. (xi) Attached to the flaps of the bicuspid and tricuspid valves are special fibrous cords, the chordae tendineae, which are joined to the other ends with the special muscles of the ventricular wall, the papillary muscles. (x) The openings of the right and the left ventricles into the pulmonary atery and the aorla respectively are provided with the semilunar valves."
Explain the working mechanism of heart.,"(i) The heart collects blood through both atria and then distributes it through ventricles. (ii) The action of heart includes contractions and relaxations of atria and ventricles respectively called as systole and diastole.  (iii) The right atrium receives.de-oxygenated blood from different parts of body and from the heart itself through the openings-superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and coronary sinus respectively. (iv) The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs through the openings of the pulmonary veins. (v) The deoxygenated and oxygenated bloods are forced into their respective ventricles. (vi) The contraction of atria is initiated and activated by SA node which spreads the wave of contraction through AV node which are latter transmitted to all parts of ventricles via bundle of His and Purkinje's fibres. (vii) During the contraction of ventricles the backward flow of blood into the atria is prevented by bicuspid and tricuspid valves. (viii) Thus, blood from the left ventricle and right ventricle is forced into the aorta and pulmonary trunk respectively. (ix) In this way the oxygenated blood is supplied to the various parts of the body including the heart itself.  "
Explain the following processes: (i) Polarisation of the membrane of a nerve fibre. (ii) Depolarisation of the membrane of a nerve fibre. (iii) Conduction of a nerve impulse along a nerve fibre. (iv) Transmission of a nerve impulse across a chemical synapse.,"When a neuron is not conducting an impulse, i.e., resting, the axonal membrane is more permeable to K+ and nearly impermeable to Na +. Similarly, the membrane is impermeable to negatively charged proteins present in the axoplasm. Consequently, the axoplasm contains high concentration of K + and negatively charged proteins and low concentration of Na +. In contrast, the fluid outside contains a low concentration of K+, a high concentration of Na and thus forms a concentration gradient. These ionic gradients across the resting membrane are maintained by the sodium-potassium pump. As a result, the outer surface of the axonal  membrane possesses a positive charge while its inner surface becomes negatively charged and therefore is polarised. (ii) Depolarization of the membrane of a nerve fibre: (a) Stimulation of an axon immediately enhances manifold its membrane permeability to Na +. As a result, Na+ ions diffuse across the membrane from the extracellular fluid (ECF) where their concentration is higher, to the interior of the fibre where the concentration is much lower. But the membrane permeability to K + starts rising somewhat later only, so there is simultaneous rise in the outward diffusion of K+ from the cell interior having a higher K + concentration. (b) These effects lower the overall cation concentration outside and enhance its concentration inside the membrane. (c) The membrane is, thus deposited, with its interior becoming electropositive to the exterior. (d) The depolarization spreads a local current. It induces nearby passive Na+ channels to open and so as to depolarize the nearby site. (e) Hence the initial depolarization passes outward over the membrane and spreads out in all directions from the site of stimulation. (iii) Conduction of nerve impulse along a nerve fibre: (a) It is a property of nerve fibre to become excited by a stimulus and then conduct that stimulus for the required and appropriate response. (b) In conducting a stimulus, the nerve axon has to pass through resting phase to active phase and then the recovery phase. (iv) Transmission of a Nerve impulse across a chemical Synapse: (a) The physiological junction between two neurons across which nerve impulses can be transmitted is known as synapse. (b) Synapse occur between the knob like axon endings of one neuron and the dendrites of cell body of another. (c) At the junction of two neurons a narrow fluid filled space called synaptic cleft is present. (d) Knob like endings of one neuron form many membrane bound vesicles called synaptic vesicles. (e) Since they help in the transmission of nerve impulse, they are also called as neurotransmitters. (f) When a nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal the synaptic vesicles get stimulated and release their stored chemicals in the synaptic cleft. These chemicals then diffuse through these clefts to reach the membrane of the next neurons and stimulate the next neurons."
Explain what are simple sensory receptors and special sensory receptors.,"There are five senses: touch, vision, hearing, smell and taste. While touch is a complex general sense, the other four are special senses. The general sensory receptors are simple receptors that are mostly modified dendritic ends of sensory neurons. Such receptors are present throughout the body: in the skin, mucous membranes, connective tissues and muscles. These monitor most of the types of general sensory information such as tactile sensation (a mix of touch, pressure, stretch and vibration), heat, cold, pain and muscle sense (perception). In contrast, special sensory receptors are distinct receptor cells that are actually confined to the head region and are highly localized within complex sensory organs like eyes  and ears and tissues of the taste buds and olfactory epithelium. These sensory organs and tissues are collection of cells of many different types (receptor and non-receptor cells), working together to accomplish a specific receptive process."
Explain the sense of smell (olfaction).,"Sense of smell (olfaction): Nose contains the receptors of smell, in the mucous coated thin, yellowish patch of olfactory epithelium. It is located way up at the roof of the nasal cavity on either sides of the nasal septum.  Fig. Human nose showing olfactory bulb and magnified view of olfactory epithelium The olfactory epithelium contains three types of cells: (i) millions of olfactory receptor cells; (ii) columnar supportive cells; (iii) short basal cells. Olfactory receptors are unusual bipolar sensory neurons. The thin dendrites of each of these neurons run to the surface of the epithelium where these bear a cluster of about 20 modified cilia which function as receptor sites. These cilia extend from the olfactory epithelium into the thin coat of nasal mucous secreted by the supportive cells and olfactory glands. This mucous is a solvent that captures and dissolves the air borne odour molecules. Once dissolved, the chemicals bind to the specific receptors on the cilia stimulating he receptor cells. This causes depolarization and ultimately action potential in the receptor cell. The axons of the olfactory receptors unite to form the olfactory nerve which transmits the information directly to the overlying olfactory bulb, a relay station in the brain. Unlike receptor ends of other senses, the axons of the olfactory receptors directly extend from the outside environment (the nasal cavity) into the olfactory  bulb, a part of the brain. The number of receptors stimulated indicates the strength of the stimulus. As with taste, some of the smell, can be really painful. The nasal cavity contains pain receptors that respond to irritants such as ammonia, vinegar or hot chilly pepper. Impulses from these pain receptors reach the brain. The brain combines these sensations with those of smell to identify the odours. Although humans do have a good sense of smell - we can detect about 10,000 different odours."
Explain the sense of touch.,"Sense of touch: Skin is the sensory organ for touch and is also the largest sense organ. Our sense of touch allows us to feel light sensation like the touch of a feather as well as a heavy sensation like a stone falling on the toe. These sensations come from millions of microscopic simple sensory receptors located all over the skin and associated with the general sensations of contact or pressure, heat, cold, and pain. The receptors are located at different levels within the skin and distributed unevenly. Some parts of the body have a large number of these such as the finger tips, making them more sensitive. Structurally, these touch receptors are either free dendritic endings or encapsulated dendritic endings present in the skin (and other parts of the body). When stimulated, these transmit the sensation to the brain. Given below is a list of some of these receptors present in the skin. (i) Free or bare dendritic nerve endings are present throughout the epidermis taking an extensive branching or ""zigzag"" form. These respond chiefly to pain and temperature but some respond to pressure as well. The root hair plexuses, network of free nerve endings that surround hair follicles, are light touch receptors that detect bending of hairs. (ii) Meissner's corpuscles are located in the papillary layer of the dermis just below the epidermis, which respond to touch our skin. (iii) Pacinian corpuscles are scattered deep in the dermis and in the subcutaneous tissue of the skin. These are stimulated by deep pressure. These receptors are best suited to monitor vibrations, on-off pressure. (iv) Ruffini's corpuscles respond to heat. (v) Krause's corpuscles are excited by cold and are found in large numbers in the face and hands."
Explain the sense of taste (gustation).,"Sense of taste (gustation): The sense of taste and smell work closely together. If we cannot smell something we cannot taste it either. One reason why we cannot taste (or smell) food well with a common cold is that with the nasal passages inflamed and coated with thick mucus layer the smell receptors are practically nonfunctional. The receptor cells for taste are located in taste buds. Humans have about 10,000 taste buds. The majority of taste buds are located in pockets around the papillae (peg-like projections of the mucous membrane) on the surface and sides of the tongue, but there are some on the surface of the pharynx and the larynx. Each taste bud contains about 40 specialized receptor cells or gustatory cells, many more supporting cells and some basal cells that replace the worn out cells of the taste buds. Unlike the receptors for smell, that are modified sensory neurons, the receptor cells for taste are not neurons, but rather specialized cells with slender microvilli on their outer ends. The  microvilli protrude into the surrounding fluids through a narrow opening called the taste pore. Dissolved chemicals contacting the microvilli bind to specific receptor present on the microvilli, thereby depolarizing the cell. The dendrites of the associated sensory neurons coil intimately around the receptor cells and synapse with them so that, when a receptor cell is stimulated and depolarized, it releases neurotransmitter which leads to the generation of an action potential in the associated sensory neuron. Each dendrite receives signals from several receptor cells within the taste bud. Nerve fibers emerging from the taste buds pass to the brain stem. From here the nerve impulse is relayed to the taste centre in the cerebral cortex of the brain that perceives the taste sensation. Normally our taste sensations are complicated mixture of qualities. In humans, there are f our basic taste senses: sweet, sour, salt, and bitter. The receptors for these four basic tastes have their areas of greatest concentration on different parts of the tongue: sweet and salty on the front bitter on the back, and sour on the sides. A few substances stimulate only one of the four types of receptors, but most stimulate two, three, or all four types to varying degrees. The sensation and flavour of the food we experience are thus produced by a combination of these four basic sensations, modified by accompanying sensations of smell, texture and temperature.  "

Explain the structure of pancreas and also mention the roles of the hormone secreted by it. ,"Structure of Pancreas : The pancreas lies inferior to the stomach in the first C-shaped bend of the duodenum. It acts both an exocrine and endocrine gland and thus is a composite gland. The tissue of the pancreas has in addition to the acinar cells, groups of cells called islets of Langerhans, which produce endocrine secretions. Four kinds of cells that have been identified in the islets : (a) Alpha cells produce glucagon, (a) Beta cells produce insulin, (c) Delta cells produce somatostatin, (d) PP cells produce pancreatic polypeptide. Hormone of Pancreas and their Roles : (i) Glucagon : It stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose. It is controlled by feedback in accordance with the glucose in the blood. (ii) Insulin : It is antagonistic to glucagon. Insulin decreases the level of glucose in the blood. It acts by increasing the rate at which glucose is transported out of the blood and into cells and by stimulating muscles cells to take up sugar from the blood and convert it to glycogen. (iii) Somatostatin : It suppresses the release of other hormones from the pancreas. It also appears to suppress the release of hormone from the digestive tract. (iv) Pancreatic polypeptide : It appears that pancreatic polypeptide inhibits the release of digestive secretion of the pancreas. "

It regulates uterine contraction of smooth muscles during child birth. (ii) Ovulation : Luetinizing Hormone (LH) secreted by anterior pituitary (adenolypophysis) regulates the ovulation. (iii) Rise in blood sugar : Insulin secreted by Islets of Langerhans regulate rise in blood sugar. (iv) Fall in calcium ion level in blood : Parathormone secreted by parathyroid gland regulate rise in blood sugar. (v) Urinary elimination of water : ADH secreted by posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis) is called vasopressin. It decreases the volume of water by increasing reabsorption from urine.

Give a brief account of the hormones secreted by adrenal cortex.,"Adrenal cortex secretes cortical steroids that are grouped into three catagories: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids and gonadocorticoids. (i) Mineralocorticoids : (a) These hormones are secreted by the cells of zona glomerulosa or adrenal cortex. (b) Aldosterone (salt-retaining hormone) is the principal mineralocorticoid in humans. Its main function is to regulate the balance of water and electrolytes in our body. Aldosterone acts mainly at the renal tubules and stimulates the reabsorption ion of Na + and water and excretion of K + and phosphate ions. (ii) Glucocorticoids : (a) They effect carbohydrate metabolism, however, they also affect the metabolism of proteins and fats. Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and proteolysis and inhibit cellular uptake and utilisation of amino acids. (iii) Gonadocorticoids : (a) They are also called sex hormones of adrenal glands. (b) These male sex hormones are called androgens which are important in the development of a male foetus. (c) A male foetus develops normal male characteristics only if the foetal gonads and adrenal glands produced sufficient quantities of androgens (d) Androgens stimulate the development of male secondary sexual characters like distribution of body hair. (f) Female sex hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex are oestrogens which maintain the development of female secondary sexual characters."
What are the hormones produced by anterior pituitary ? What function does each serve ?,"The principal hormone produced by anterior lobe of pituitary are following : (i) Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) : It stimulates the testis in man to produce sperms i.e., spermatogenesis and ovaries in female to produce ova (oogenesis). It also stimulates ovaries to secrete female sex hormone called estrogens.  (ii) Luteinizing Hormone (LH): It stimulates testis to secrete male sex hormone named androgens and testosterone. It also stimulates ovaries to secrete the female sex hormone called progesterone. In females together with FSH it triggers ovulation, stimulates conversion of ovarian follicles into corpus luteum which secretes oestrogen and progesterone. (iii) Prolactin Hormone (PLH) or Luteotropic Hormone (LTH) : It stimulates milk production and secretion, reproduction, osmoregulation, growth and metabolism. (iv) Thyroid stimulating hormone : It stimulates the growth of thyroid gland and the secretions of thyroid hormones. (v) Adrenocorticotropic Hormone: It stimulates the adrenal cortex to grow and secrete glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and gonadocorticoids. (vi) Growth Hormone (GH) : It stimulates growth of a body by stimulating retention of proteins and calcium in the body, synthesis and deposition of proteins in tissues, growth and elongation in long bones and proportionate growth of muscles and visceral organs. (vii) Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (MSH) : It appears to be functional only in cold blooded animals such as fishes, amphibians and reptiles.

Write any five reasons by which a person can become type 2 diabetes patients. (KVS Silchar 2017),"Following are the five reasons : (i) Insulin resistance is the most common cause of type 2 diabetes. (ii) It can be hereditary. (iii) Lifestyle choices that affect the development of type 2 diabetes include : (a) Lack of exercise : Physical activity has many benefits-one of them being that it can help you avoid type 2 diabetes, if you're susceptible. (b) Unhealthy meal planning choices : A meal plan filled with high-fat foods and lacking in fibre increases the likelihood of type 2 diabetes. (c) Overweight/Obesity : Lack of exercise and unhealthy meal planning choices can lead to obesity, or make it worse. Being overweight makes it more likely that you'll become insulin resistant and can also lead to many other healthy conditions."
Explain the following : (i) Insulin lowers the blood sugar level. (ii) Hypothalamus and pituitary function as an integrated and co-ordinated system. (iii) Body growth is generally accelerated at puberty in the male.,"(i) Insulin hormone is secreted by pancreatic islets. Insulin increases the utilization of glucose in tissues and facilitates the storage of glucose as glycogen in muscles and liver. By these actions insulin lowers the blood sugar level.  (ii) It is fact that Hypothalamus and Pituitary function as an integrated coordinated system. In hypothalamus, the hormones are synthesized in the neurosecretory cells body and then transported along the axon to its tip where the hormones are stored in droplets. Hypothalamic neuro-secreting cells secrete several hormones called neurohormones into this blood. These reach the anterior pituitary through the portal blood and control the secretion of hormones by the cells of that gland. For example : Thyrotropin releasing hormone, corticotropin releasing hormone and gonadotropin releasing hormone of hypothalamus stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete the hormones called thyrotropin, corticotropin and gonadotropins respectively. On the other hand the hormone somatostatin of the hypothalamus inhibits the secretion of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary. (iii) Sex hormones are secreted near the age of puberty or sexual maturity. Testosterone stimulates the development of the external male sex characters such as beards, moustaches, and low pitch male voice in man. Thus, testosterone promotes the growth of many body tissues including bones and muscles. Androgens are such substances which stimulate the development of male sex characters.  "
Describe the urinary system of humans with the help of well labelled diagram.,"Human urinary system comprises a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary bladder and a urethra. (i) Kidneys: (a) There is pair of kidneys which are dark-red, bean shaped, each with a notch, the hilum on its inner side. (b) Blood vessels, lymph vessels, nerves and ureter enter or leave the kidney through the hilum. (c) They are situated in the anterior part of the abdominal cavity one on either side of the median line. (d) Last two pair of ribs (floating ribs) protect the kidneys. (e) The concave side of each kidney faces inwards and convex side outwards. (f) The right kidney is slightly lower than the left and the left kidney is little nearer to the middle plane than the right. (g) The kidney is metanephric. (ii) Ureters: (a) The ureter of each kidney leaves from the renal pelvis in the hilum region. (b) They are narrow, tubular structures, and open into the urinary bladder. (c) They carry urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. (iii) Urinary bladder: (a) It lies in the pelvic cavity and is pear shaped, muscular, sac-like structure. (b) The muscular layer of the urinary bladder is well developed. The latter consists of three layers of smooth muscle-inner and outer layer of longitudinal fibres and middle layer of circular fibres. (c) Both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems innervate the urinary bladder. (d) The urinary bladder stores urine temporarily. (iv) Urethra: (a) It is a canal like structure which extends from the neck of the bladder and leads to exterior. (b) It opens by urethral orifice infront of vaginal aperture (genital aperture). (c) In male, urethra is much longer which opens out at the tip of the penis by urinogenital aperture. (d) Thus the urethra of male carries both urine and semen. "
"Difference between Ammonotelism, Ureotelism and Uricotelism.","S. Ammonotelism No. (i) Excretory waste is ammonia (NH3). (ii) It is characteristic of aquatic animals such as protozoans, sponges, coelenterates, crustaceans, bony fishes and echinoderms etc. (iii)  Excess of water is required to eliminate ammonia. It is highly toxic.  (iv)  Water loss is about 300-500 ml to remove one gram of ammonia.  (v)  Ammonia is formed in liver cells by the deamination of the amino acids.  Ureotelism  Uricotelism  Excretory waste is urea (NH2-CO-NH2). It is characteristic of mammals, cartilaginous fishes (e.g., dogfish) and amphibians etc.  Excretory waste is uric acid. It is characteristic of terrestrial reptiles and insects. All the birds are uricotelic.  Less water is needed, urea is less toxic than ammonia. It can be retained for some time in body without any harmful effect. Water loss is about 50 ml to eliminate one gram of urea.  Much less water is needed. Uric acid is least toxic.  Urea is formed in liver by detoxification of ammonia.  Water loss is about 10 ml to excrete out one gram of uric acid. Uric acid is formed mainly from the purines in liver cells. In insects, uric acid is formed in malpighian tubules. "
"Describe briefly the regulation of kidney function by the following. (i) ADH, (ii) ANE (iii) Renin","Regulation of Kidney: (i) ADH: Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is secreted by hypothalamus of the brain and released into the blood from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. The release of ADH is triggered when osmo-receptors in the hypothalamus detect an increase in the osmolarity of the blood above a set point of 300 osmo mL-1. In this situation the osmoreceptors cells also promote thirst. It increases the reabsorption of water in the DCT and collecting duct. (ii) ANF: Atrial natriuretic factor is another hormone which opposes the regulation by RAAS. The walls of the artery of the heart release ANF in response to an increase in blood volume and pressure. ANF inhibits release of renin from the JG cells and thereby inhibits NaCl reabsorption by the collecting duct and reduces aldosterone release from the adrenal gland. Thus ADH, RAAS and ANF regulate the function of the kidneys. As a result they control body fluid osmolarity, salt concentration, blood pressure and blood volume. (iii) Renin: The smooth muscle cells of both the afferent and efferent arterioles are swollen and contain dark granules. These cells are called juxtaglomerular cells. A fall in glomerular blood flow or glomerular blood pressure activate the JG cells to release renin. Renin converts angiotensinogen in blood into angiotensin II. The later increases blood pressure. Angiotensin  also stimulates the secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex, thus infusing the reabsorption of sodium ions by the DCT and that of water through collecting ducts."
Explain the process of urine formation in human being. ,"Urine formation includes three processes: (i) Ultrafiltration, (ii) Selective reabsorption, (iii) Selective Secretion. (i) Ultrafiltration: It is filtration which occurs under high blood pressure. The afferent arteriole supplies blood to glomerulus and efferent arteriole collects blood from glomerulus. Therefore, the blood pressure in glomerulus becomes 75 mm of Hg. The smaller molecules of glucose, water, salts, ammonia etc. diffuse from glomerulus to Bowman's capsule and this process is called ultrafiltration. About 1.5-2.5% of water and solutes are removed from the blood plasma that flows through glomerulus. The quantity of glomerular filtrate formed each minutes in all nephrons of both kidneys is called the glomerular filtration rate. In a normal person, the glomerular filtration rate is about 125ml. per minute. (ii) Selective reabsorption: It is the process by which useful material are absorbed by the blood from glomerular filtrate. The tubular epithelial cells in different segments of nephron perform this either by active or passive mechanisms. Substances like glucose, amino acids, Na+, etc., in the filtrate are reabsorbed actively where as the nitrogenous wastes are absorbed by passive transport. In collecting tubules some water is absorbed. (iii) Selective secretion: The metabolic waste products like ammonia, hippuric acid, creatinine, H+ ions etc., present in the blood diffuses into DCT. This process is called selective secretion. It changes the complete composition of glomerular filtrate which is now called urine."
Q. 3.Human kidneys can produce urine nearly four times concentrated than the filtrate formed. Explain the mechanism of production of hypertonic urine.  Explain the counter current mechanism in Vasa Recta. Also mention its significance. (DDE 2017),Refer to NCERT Exemplar LAQ Q.1.  
Define growth. Explain the phases of growth.,"Growth is defined as 'a permanent or irreversible increase in dry weight, mass or volume of a cell, organ or organism‚Äô. Plant growth takes place in three steps or phases cell division (meristematic), cell elongation and cell maturation. (i) Cell division (Meristematic) phase: (i) It is also called formative phase. (ii) New cells are produced by mitotic divisions of the pre-existing cells. (iii) The meristematic cells have thin cellulose walls with abundant plasmodesmetal connections, dense protoplasm and conspicuous nuclei. (iv) In higher plants, cell division occurs in meristems or growing points. (v) As the formation of new cells requires intense biosynthetic activity, the rate of respiration in the cells of formation phase is very high. (ii) Cell enlargement phase: (i) This phase lies just behind the growing points and is mainly responsible for growth of plant parts. (ii) The newly formed cells, produced in formative phase ergo enlargement. (iii) The enlarging cell also develops a central vacuole. Rate of respiration is but less than that of the cells in the formative phase. (iv) Thus, this phase is characterised by cell enlargement, new cell wall deposition and increased vacuolation. (iii) Cell maturation phase: (i) This phase occurs just behind the phase of elongation. (ii) The enlarged cells develop into particular type of cells by undergoing structural and physiological differentiation. (iii) Hence, at this phase all the diverse tissue types observed in root or stem viz., epidermis, cortex, vascular tissues etc., and cell are differentiated."
What is growth rate? How will you measure the rate of growth ?,"(i) Growth rate refers to the expression of increased growth per unit time. (ii) It can be arithmetic or geometric increase. (iii) In arithmetic growth, following mitotic cell division only one daughter cell continues to divide while the other differentiates and mature. (iv) The simplest expression of arithmetic growth is exemplified by a root elongating at a constant rate. (v) On plotting length of the organ at different times a linear curve is obtained. It is expressed as: Lt = L 0 + rt  Here,  Lt = Length at time ‚Äòt‚Äô L0 = Length at time Zero‚Äô r = growth rate per unit time.  (vi) In geometrical growth, the initial growth is slow (lag phase) and rapidly at an exponential rate (log or exponential phase). (vii) In this growth, both the progeny cells formed by mitotic cell division retain the ability to divide and continue to do so. (viii) However, with limited nutrient supply, the growth slows down (stationary phase). (ix) If we plot a parameter of growth against time, we get a typical S-shaped or sigmoid curve. (x) The exponential growth can be expressed as:  W 1 = W0 ùëí ùëüùë° Here, W 1 = final size (Weight, height, number etc.) W 0 = initial size r = growth rate t = time of growth ùëí = base of natural logarithms."
Discuss the role of growth regulators in agriculture.,"Role of growth regulators in agriculture: (i) Parthenocarpy: The knowledge of the fact that application of auxins and gibberellins on unpollinated flowers results in the production of seedless fruits has been a great horticultural importance. It has been of great significance in such fruits where the number of seeds is very high and the seeds are of light food value (e.g., tomato, brinjal, guava, papaya, watermelon, orange) or the seeds are large in size (e.g., Litchi and Mango). (ii) Flower thinning: This problem refers to fall of unpollinated or unfertilized flowers from certain fruit trees e.g., in pineapple and litchi. This problem has been solved to a great extent by spraying the plants with 2, 4-D and Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA) both of which are synthetic auxins. (iii) Fruit ripening: Ethylene plays an important role in ripening of various fruits like oranges, lemons, grapes, banana etc. (iv) Root inducing or Root induction: NAA and Indole Butyric Acid (IBA) are very important in inducing roots on stem cuttings. Many plants are known which propagate by their stem cuttings such as Bougainvillea, roses, grapes, apples, coleus etc. (v) Seed germination: Seeds having long periods of dormancy can be made to germinate early by the application of auxins "
Mention elaborately the functions of Auxins.,"Functions of Auxins: (i) Cell enlargement: Auxins promote elongation and growth of stems and roots enlargement of many fruits by stimulating cell enlargement. The auxins cause cell enlargement by solubilization of carbohydrates, loosening of microfibrils synthesis of more wall materials, increased membrane permeability and respiration. (ii) Cell division in cambium: Auxin is responsible for initiation and promotion of cell division in cambium. The reactivation of cambium in the growing season is apparently triggered by IAA moving from the developing shoot buds. (iii) Cell division and tissue culture: In tissue culture auxins initiate and promote cell division, and result in the formation of callus. (iv) Root growth and root initiation: Auxins promote root growth only at extremely low concentration. At higher concentration, auxin is suitable for shoot elongation."
Give the natural and artificial overcoming of seed dormancy.,"Natural overcoming of seed dormancy: (i) Weakening of tough and impermeable seed coats by microbial action. (ii) Rupturing or weakening of seed coats by mechanical abrasions. (iii) Action of digestive enzymes present in alimentary canals of birds and other animals which happen to feed on their fruits. (iv) Leaching of inhibitors present in the seed coat. (v) Inactivation or oxidation of inhibitors by heat, cold and light. Artificial overcoming of seed dormancy: (i) Rupturing of seed coats or scarification by abrasion through machine threshing, filing, chipping, vigorous shaking, etc. (ii) Treatment with hot water or fat solvents for dissolution of surface inhibitors, waxes, etc. (iii) Treatment with concentrated sulphuric acid for a short period followed by thorough washing to remove all traces of the mineral acid. (iv) Stratification or subjecting the moist seeds in the presence of oxygen to periods of low or high temperature. (v) Counteracting the effect of growth inhibitors by soaking the seeds in potassium nitrate, ethylene chlorohydrin, thiourea, gibberellins, etc. Exposure to high concentration of oxygen has similar effect.

What is seed dormancy? How many types of dormancy are there ?,"Seed dormancy or rest is the internal or innate inhibition of germination of otherwise normal or viable seed even when present under most favourable conditions required for its germination. Dormancy is of several types. The important ones are as follows: (i) Immature embryo: The embryo is not fully developed at the time of seed shedding. The period of seed dormancy corresponds to the period required by the embryo for its complete development. e.g. Ginkgo biloba. (ii) After ripening: After shedding, the seeds of barley, wheat require an interval of ripening before they attain the power of germination. This period is needed to produce the necessary growth hormones. (iii) Impermeability of seed coats: The seed coats are impermeable to water, gases or chemical e.g., Chenopodium, Apple, Xanthium respectively. (iv) Tough seed coats: The seed coats are hard and growth of provide mechanical resistance to the embryo."
What are the uses of Ethylene and Abscissic acid?,"Uses of Ethylene: (i) Ethylene is used for colour development and ripening of certain fleshy fruits. (ii) Application of ethephon in cucumber increases the number of female flowers and hen fruits (iii) The sprouting of storage organs such as rhizomes, corms, tubers can be enhanced by exposing them to ethylene. Uses of Abscissic acid: (i) ABA can be used as anti-transpirant. Application of minute quantity of ABA to leaves reduces transpiration to a great extent through partial closure of stomata. (ii) Abscissic acid can be used to promote rooting in many stem cuttings. (iii) The dormancy of buds, seeds and storage organs can be prolonged by the application of ABA."
Mention the examples which prove that phytohormones act synergistically or antagonistically.,"Phytochrome: (i) It is the pigment which is responsible for flowering. (ii) It makes the plant sensitive to light effect. (iii) It is known as light absorbing pigment and is responsible for photosensitiveness of plants. (iv) It participates in flowering. In long day plants, the light interruption of dark period does not prevent (v) If the light is by infra-red, the flowering gets promoted. (vi) Phytochrome occurs in two forms-one red absorbing (PR) and the other far red absorbing (P FR). (vii) Both the forms are photo-chemically interconvertible. (viii) The red absorbing form after absorbing the red light is converted into far red form. (ix) They absorbs the infra-red light and is converted back into red absorbing form of pigment.  (x) Flowering is considered a phytochrome mediated process. (xi) Photoperiodism controls flowering in plants. Short-day plants like Xanthium, Chrysanthemum require a relatively short day high period and a continuous dark period of about 14-16 hours for flowering. (xii) Dark period is more important to induce flowering than the light period. Flowering can be induced in short day plants by red light treatment followed by far red light treatment.  "
