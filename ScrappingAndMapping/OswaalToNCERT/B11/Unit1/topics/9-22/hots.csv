How do chylomicrons differ from micelles with regard to their structural components?,"Differences between chylomicrons and micelles: S. No.  Chylomicrons  Micelles  (i)  Protein coated water soluble fat droplets of about 150mm released into the lymph.  It is formed by combination of fatty acids, monoylglycerols and the bile salts.  (ii)  In this form fats/ lipids are put into circulation.  In this form, digested fats are absorbed in intestinal cells in alimentary canal. "
The stomach of a patient had to be removed on medical grounds. What special diet would you recommend him and why?,"When the stomach of a patient is to be removed on medical grounds and the oesophagus is directly connected with the duodenum, the patient should be given simple diet in liquid form only. Milk is to be avoided because the curdling of milk takes place only in the stomach. The food may consist of glucose, protein, carbohydrates all mixed together in the liquid form. No solids should be given to him. This liquid food should be such that it could be acted upon by intestinal juice."
"How vitamin E helps in maintaining normal membrane structure, and thus keeping skin healthy ?","Primary role of vitamin-E is to serve as an antioxidant as it prevents oxidation of certain materials (i.e., it inhibits peroxide formation and thereby prevents damage of membrane lipids and thus maintains normal membrane structure). Thus vitamin E keeps skin healthy."
What digestive disorders do you expect in a habitual alcoholic?,"Alcoholic is a person who consumes lots of alcohol regularly. Alcohol is directly absorbed from the stomach by the blood capillaries. The alcohol is known to cause damage to the liver cells. Liver cells produce bile juice. If the liver cells are damaged they would not be able to produce bile. If the bile is not produced in required quantities, the emulsification and further digestion of fats is not possible. This would bring about disturbances in the digestion and adsorption of fats. The alcohol also hardens the stomach wall, which would reduce the churning of food in the stomach.  "
Persons suffering from very low blood pressure pass no urine. Why? What suggestion would you offer for the removal of waste products from the blood in such a situation?,"It is true that a person suffering from very low blood pressure does not pass sufficient urine. The reason for this is, the blood to pass through the glomerulus of the nephron must have required amount of pressure in it. If the pressure is not sufficient it will not flow through the glomerulus and filtration would not take place, hence no urine would be formed. This is quite harmful to the person as waste products go on accumulating in the body. To avoid this, a person should be advised to take sufficient amount of water and medicines to keep the blood pressure at an optimum level."
"Suppose the kidneys of a person are damaged, can you predict what is going to happen to him?","The kidneys are considered as master chemists of the body. (i) If they are damaged, it would disturb the normal functioning of the life processes. (ii) Due to the effect of toxins produced by some bacteria the filters of tiny uriniferous tubules are damaged. (iii) They become perforated with larger holes and allow blood cells, and proteins to pass through them along with the urea and water during filtration of blood in formation of urine."
An aquarium fish and a pigeon were fed on protein diet. In what different forms would they excrete their nitrogenous wastes? Why do they excrete so differently?,An aquarium fish excrete ammonia whereas a pigeon excretes uric acid. Ammonia is highly toxic and needs to be eliminated as rapidly as it is formed. A fish living in water have immediate access to water and can eliminate ammonia easily and directly. Ammonia being soluble in water requires a large volume of water for its elimination which a fish can afford. A bird has very less access to water and can conserve water in its body by eliminating insoluble uric acid crystals.  
Why aldosterone is called as salt retaining hormone?,"(i) Aldosterone (salt-retaining hormone) is the principal mineralocorticoid in humans. Its main function is to regulate the sodium content of the body. It is secreted when the sodium level is low. (ii) It acts on the kidneys to cause more sodium to be returned to the blood and more potassium to be excreted. (iii) As the sodium concentration in the blood increases, water follows it by osmosis, so the blood volume also increases. Thus, the effect of aldosterone is to increase both sodium and water in the blood."
How control of insulin and glucagon is regulated by push and pull mechanism ?,"(i) It is regulated by a ‚Äòlimit-control feedback‚Äô or ‚Äòpush and pull feedback' mechanism. (ii) When sugar level in blood increases, insulin is secreted and glucagon secretion is inhibited. (iii) When blood-sugar level falls, for instance during excessive physical labour or stress, secretion of glucogen is stimulated and insulin secretion is inhibited. (iv) This is the self-regulating device."
How is communication among parts of an organism accomplished?,"(i) Hormones, a chemical messenger is transported by blood, they reach target organs, i.e., organs for which they are intended. (ii) Hormones may stimulate or inhibit specific biological processes in target organs to modify their activities. Thus they regulate organs and tissues. (iii) The activity of these messenger molecules, i.e., hormones secreted in the blood by endocrine glands is under the direct control of the nervous system.  "
What is oxygen debt? Explain.,"(i) The muscles fails to get sufficient oxygen during strenuous exercise to fulfil their energy requirements and contracts anaerobically. It accumulates lactic acid produced by glycolysis. The oxygen consumption of muscles exceed during recovery, known as oxygen debt of the muscle. (ii) This oxygen is used in oxidising the accumulated lactic acid aerobically and restoring ATP in muscle fibre."
Why a red muscle fibre works for a prolonged period while a white muscle fibre suffers from fatigue after a shorter work?,"(i) Red muscle fibres are rich in myoglobin and contain large number of mitochondria. (ii) Function of myoglobin is to bind and store oxygen and oxymyoglobin. (iii) During muscle contraction oxygen is released from the oxymyoglobin. (iv) Red muscle fibres produce energy only under aerobic conditions so very less amount of lactic acid gets accumulated in the muscle. Hence these muscles can work for a prolonged period. (v) White muscle fibre, myoglobin is absent and there are very less number of mitochondria so they depend on aerobic glycolysis for their energy production. (vi) As a result of this, large amount of lactic acid gets accumulated in the muscle and hence these muscle gets fatigued soon.  "
"Write a note on ""Regulation of Cardiac Activity""","Regulation of Cardiac Activity : (i) The special neural centre located in medulla oblongata of brain can moderate cardiac function through autonomic nervous system. Therefore, ANS helps in controlling heart regulation. (ii) The parasympathetic neural signals, (componentof ANS) decreases the rate of heart beat, speed of condition of action potential and also the cardiac output. (iii) The adrenal medullary hormones enhance cardiac output. (iv) The neural signals through sympathetic nerves may increase heart beat rate and the strength of ventricular contraction and also cardiac output."
"If a patients' ECG revealed an abnormally long delay between the P wave and the QRS deflection, what would that suggest?","If a patients' ECG revealed an abnormally long delay between P wave and the QRS deflection, it suggest that there is a delay of conduction from the atria to the ventricles, hence the stimulation from SA nodes are conducting stimuli very slowly to theventricles.  "
What happens when the membrane of a nerve cell carries out a sodium pump?,"(i) The membrane is in resting potential (‚àí80ùëöùëâ). (ii) There is more Na+ ions on outside of axon membrane of ECF then inside of axon  membrane. (iii) K+ ions move out and the membrane is positively charged outside and negatively charged inside. (iv) When stimulus is applied, the axon membrane becomes negatively charged outside and positively charged inside. (v) Depolarized points becomes repolarized and Na+ ions move to outside while K+ ions inside. (vi) The process involves expelling out Na+ ions and drawing in K+ ions concentration."
Sensory cells of an eye are called as rod cells and cone cells. Why? What are these concerned with?,"The rods and cones are the modified forms of the sensory cells and their names are due to their shapes. (i) The rods mainly enable the animal to see in the darkness, therefore, rods are present in large number in nocturnal animals. (ii) The cones are chiefly concerned with the distinction in colour and light vision during day time.  "
In how many ways does the growth of living system can be quantitatively compared?,"The quantitative comparisons can be done in two ways: (i) Absolute growth rate: It is the measurement and the comparison of total growth per unit time. (ii) Relative growth rate: It is growth of system per unit time expressed on a common basis, e.g., per unit initial parameter."
How can you raise Pfr value in Soyabean plant? What is the effect of raised Pfr value?,Soyabean is a short day plant : The Pfr form of phytochrome is converted in Pr form by exposure of red light (wavelength 660 nm). The Pfr form is considered as the biologically active form of phytochrome. Germination and other phytochrome controlled processes are promoted by Pfr.
In most plants the terminal bud suppresses the development of lateral buds. What is this phenomenon called? Name the phytohormone that can promote the phenomenon.,"In most plants the terminal bud suppresses the development of lateral buds. This phenomenon is called apical dominance. Auxins are the phytohormones which can promote this phenomenon in plants. Example, NAA and 2, 4-D etc.  "
"If you grow a potted plant that initially weighed 200 and eventually weighed 50 kg, would you expect the soil in the pot to change weight? Explain.","(i) The soil in the pot will change its weight due to accumulation of minerals, fertilizers, capillary and hygroscopic water and the micro-organisms. (ii) The plants increase its weight due to manufacturing of food during photosynthesis. (iii) Plant depends largely on air, water and soil organisms in the soil of pot to fulfil its need. (iv) This results in the growth of plant by increasing the weight of soil in the pot.  "
How Cellular respiration resembles combustion?,Cellular respiration resembles combustion in the following ways: (i) Breakdown of complex organic substances. (ii) Utilization of carbon dioxide. (iii) Release of energy.  
What is stomatal periodicity? What are the categories of stomata?,"Stomatal periodicity is the rate of opening and closing of stomata during day and night. Stomata usually open during day and close during night. There are three categories of stomata : (i) Barley or cereal type : They are dumb-bell shaped. The stomata usually open during the day for a few hours. (ii) Leuceme or alfalfa type : They open during day and close during night under mesophytic conditions. In succulents, the stomata remain closed during the day. They open only during night. (iii) Potato Type : Under mesophytic conditions, the stomata can remain open through day and night but close down for different periods and at various times under less water availability.  "
What are the unique features of metabolic pathway ?,The metabolic pathway has following unique features : (i) The interlinked metabolic traffic is very smooth and without a single mishap under healthy conditions. (ii) Every chemical reaction of the metabolic pathway is a catalysed reaction. (iii) The catalysts which hastens the rate of a given metabolic conversion are proteins. The protein which possess catalytic power are called enzymes.
Describe the role of DNA in the life of an organism.,"Role of DNA in the life of an organism: (i) DNA is known as the master molecule of the organism. It is the vehicle of the heredity and store house of all informations required for the growth, differentiation etc. (ii) This information in deoxyribose nucleic acid is contained in the form of blue print. (iii) It gives message to the cell for duplication and transcription. This message is used for protein synthesis by the cells."
"Define and explain the ""Living State"".","Living State: The living state is a non-equilibrium steady-state to be able to perform work. (i) The living process is a constant effort to prevent falling into equilibrium and is achieved by energy input. (ii) The metabolism provides a mechanism for the production of energy. (iii) The living state and metabolism are synonymous, without metabolism there cannot exist a living state. (iv) A living organism works continuously so it cannot afford to reach equilibrium because a system at equilibrium cannot perform the work.  "
Why is it not healthy to breath in a closed room for a very long time?,"In a closed room, there is no provision of fresh air coming into the room. The oxygen already present in the air of that room shall be gradually consumed. If more number of people are sitting in a room the percentage of oxygen will go on decreasing and the percentage of carbon dioxide would go on increasing. Thus it is not a healthy sign to breath in a closed room for a very long time.  "
What is spireme stage?,It is the name of early prophase when elongated chromosomes occurs in overlapped condition like a ball of wool without their ends being visible.
What is the importance of nucleoplasmic index?,(i) Nucleoplasmic index regulates the cell division after cell has reached a particular size. (ii) It helps in maintaining ratio between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
What is midbody? How does it occur?,The central equatorial part of spindle gets changed into dense fibrous and vascular structure called midbody. (i) Microfilaments collect in the middle region of the cell below the cell membrane. This causes the cell membrane to invaginate. (ii) The furrow deepens centripetally and finally divide the parent cells into two daughter cells.
What do you understand by interphase?,(i) Interphase is a series of changes that occur in a newly formed cell and its nucleus before it becomes capable of division again. (ii) It is also called intermitosis. It is non-dividing state of the cell and its nucleus is called interphase nucleus.
What is homotypic division? What is its main function?,The division which maintain the number of chromosomes produced at the end of reduction division is called homotypic or equational division. Meiosis II stage is known as homotypic division.
