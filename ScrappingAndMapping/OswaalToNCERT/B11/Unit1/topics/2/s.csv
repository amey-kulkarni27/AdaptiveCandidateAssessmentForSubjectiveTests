questions,answers
Compare photosynthesis with chemosynthesis.,S. No.  Photosynthesis  Chemosynthesis  (i)  Photosynthesis occurs in sunlight.  It occurs day and night both.  (ii)  Light is necessary.  Light is not necessary.  (iii)  Photosynthetic bacteria have bacterio-chlorophyll which help in trapping the solar energy and converting it into chemical energy.  The energy required for synthesis of food is obtained by oxidizing chemical substances found in the surrounding medium. 
Distinguish between autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria.,S. No. (i)  (ii) (iii)  Autotrophic Bacteria The bacteria synthe-sise their own food.  Heterotrophic Bacteria  They depend on an external sources of energy for synthesis of food. Autotrophic bacteria live on inorganic substrata.  An external source of energy is not required. Heterotrophic Bacteria live on organic substratum Or living host.  The bacteria obtain organic food or organic growth factors from outside sources. 
Give the important features of Protozoa.,"(i) They are microscopic unicellular organisms with varied forms and shapes. (ii) They lack cell wall. (iii) Locomotion occurs by pseudopodia, flagella and cilia. (iv) They Show heterotrophic mode of nutrition which may be holozoic, parasitic or saprobic.  (v) These reproduces asexually by binary fission."
Draw a well labelled diagram to show E.M view of a cyanobacterial cell.,
What are chemoautotrophic bacteria? How they obtain energy+?,"(i) Diatoms are an important source of food to aquatic animals. (ii) Diatomite is porous and chemically inert, therefore used in filtration of sugar, alcohols and antibiotics. (iii) It is also employed as a cleansing agent in tooth pastes and metal polishes. (iv) It is also employed as insulation material in refrigerators, boilers and furnaces.  "
Name two features of Prokaryotes.,"Carolus Linnaeus anciently divided all living organisms into two kingdoms : Plantae and Animalia. The drawbacks of this classification are: (i) First formed animals were neither plants nor animals. (ii) Fungi differ in structure, physiology and reproductive details from plants. (iii) At lower level of organisation there are several instances where the distinction of plant and animal disappears ."
List out the major groups of protozoans.  (KVS 2017) ,Major groups of protozoans are: (i) Amoeboid protozoa (ii) Flagellated protozoans. (iii) Ciliated protozoans. (iv) Sporozoans.
Give the features of kingdom protista.,"(i) Slime moulds are both plant and animal like. (ii) They are plant like in the production of spores during reproduction and animal like in the mode of nutrition. (iii) Their somatic structures consist of wall-less, multinucleate mobile mass of protoplasm called plasmodium. (iv) They absorb nutrients directly substratum. (v) The reproductive stage consists of sporangia and spores formed after meiosis."
What is the nature of cell wall in diatoms ?,"(i) In diatoms, the cell walls form two thin overlapping shells which fit together as in a soap box. (ii) Their walls are embedded with silica making it indestructible."
Write a short note on reproduction of blue-green algae.,"(i) Blue-green algae multiply asexually by binary fission, fragmentation or by the formation of small segments called hormogonia. (ii) Typical sexual reproduction is absent."
What are cellular slime moulds ?,"(i) In cellular slime moulds ùëíùëî., Dictyostelium, thousands of individual amoeboid cells, named the myxamoebae, aggregate into slimy mass. (ii) Nuclei of the multicellular plasmodia are haploid (n). As there is no fusion of individual cells, this aggregated mass of cells is called the pseudoplasmodium."
What are archaebacteria ?,"(i) some bacteria can survive in extreme environmental conditions like high temperature, high concentration, in absence of oxygen or in presence of oxygen in high acidic or alkaline pH. Such bacteria are called archaebacteria. (ii) Their cell wall consists of non-cellulosic polysaccharide or protein and lacks peptidoglycan. This allows them to survive in extreme conditions.  "
