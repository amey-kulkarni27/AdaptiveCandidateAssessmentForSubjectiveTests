Reproduction cannot be all-inclusive defining characteristic of living organisms. Comment.,"Some organisms like mules, sterile worker bees, infertile human couples, etc., exhibit Characteristics of living things but they do not reproduce. Therefore reproduction cannot be an all-inclusive defining characteristic of living organisms."
What are the rules of binomial nomenclature? ,"Rules of nomenclature are as follows: (i) Biological names are generally in Latin or derived from Latin irrespective of their origin. (ii) The first world in a biological name represent the genus while the second component denotes the specific epithet. (iii) The words when hand written are separately underlined, or printed in italics. (iv) The first word denoting the genus starts with a capital letter while the specific epithet starts with a small letter."
What processes are basic to taxonomy?,"Characterisation, identification and nomenclature are the processes which are basic to taxonomy."
Why was nomenclature necessary?,"Plants and animals in the world are known by their local names. These local names would vary from place to place. Therefore, there was a need to standardise the naming of living organisms which is recognised all over the world. Therefore the process called nomenclature was necessary."
"Given the scientific names of the following: Rose, Mango, Potato, Frog, Cat, Earthworm.",(i) Rose: 𝑅𝑜𝑠𝑎 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑎 (ii) Mango: 𝑀𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑖𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑎 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑎 (iii) Potato: 𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑚 𝑡𝑢𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑚 (iv) Frog: 𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑎 𝑡𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑎 (v) Cat: 𝑓𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑠 𝑑𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑢𝑠 (vi) Earthworm – 𝑃ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡ℎ𝑢𝑚𝑎 
Define classification. Can it be separated from nomenclature?,Classification is a method by which organisms on the basis of some easily observable characteristics.
What do you mean by taxonomic hierarchy? Give classification of mango upto species. ,"The taxonomic hierarchy is a systematic framework in classification in which taxonomical groups are arranged in definite order, from higher to lower categories. Each category is considered as a taxonomic unit and represents a taxon. Classification of Mango: Kingdom: Plantae Division: Angiospermae Class: Dicotyledonae Order: Sapindales Family: Anacardiaceae Genus: Mangifera Species: indica"
Distinguish between a genus and species.,S. No.  Species  1.  It is the basic unit of taxonomy.  2.  It is a dynamic genetically distinct group of organisms  Genus It is first highest category above the species level. It is group of species which are closely related. 
Give the role of botanical gardens.,Role of Botanical Gardens: (i) They provide plant material for taxonomic studies. (ii) Plant species are grown here for identification. (iii) Plants are grown for research. (iv) To maintain records of local flora.
Mention any two aims of zoological parks.,Aims of zoological Parks: (i) To develop interest and awareness about wild animals in the public. (ii) The zoos are involved in the conservation of many endangered species of wild life.
What are the steps involved in the Preparation of herbarium?,(i) Collection of specimens. (ii) Drying and pressing. (iii) Mounting of the specimens. (iv) Labelling. (v) storage.  
Differentiate between the following : (i) Growth in plants and growth in animals (ii) Growth in unicellular organisms and growth in multicellular organisms (iii) Catabolism and anabolism.,"(i) Growth in plants  Growth in animals  Plants grow faster and continuously throughout their life span.  Animals grow slowly and after reaching certain size and age, animals stop growing.  (ii) Growth in unicellular organisms Growth can be observed in only 𝑖𝑛 − 𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑜 cultures.  Growth in multicellular organisms Growth can be easily observed in 𝑖𝑛 − 𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑜 as well as in 𝑖𝑛 − 𝑣𝑖𝑣𝑜.  (iii) Anabolism The biochemical reactions which are concerned with the synthesis of complex substances from simple substances are collectively called anabolism. E.g., photosynthesis.  Catabolism The biochemical reactions which are concerned with breakdown of complex organic substances into simple substances are collectively called catabolism. E.g., respiration. "
Distinguish between taxonomy and systematics.,"S. No.  Taxonomy  1.  It is the study of organisms on the basis of their characteristics.  2.  It includes morphological and anatomical features for identification.  Systematics It is the study of diversity of organisms and all their comparative and evolutionary relationships. It deals with comparative anatomy, ecology, physiology and bio-chemistry. "
What is the correct way of writing a biological name? Explain with example.,(i) The biological name is written in two words. (ii) The first is genus and the second represents species. They are printed in italics. Example 𝑃𝑖𝑠𝑢𝑚 𝑠𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑢𝑚 is the scientific name of pea.  (iii) Generic name begins with a capital letter (𝑝𝑖𝑠𝑢𝑚) and the species name begins with a small letter (𝑠𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑢𝑚).
Taxonomy for a long time was considered as descriptive science. Why?,"(i) Taxonomy: It is the branch of biology dealing with identification, naming and classification of the organism on the basis of some laws and principles. (ii) It includes characterization, identification, nomenclature and classification. (iii) The morphological characters were considered in the beginning to classify organisms. (iv) The species was considered static and fixed entity."
Give example of three species each belonging to same genera.,(i) 𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑚 𝑡𝑢𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑚 (potato) and 𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑚 𝑚𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑟𝑎 (brinjal). (ii) 𝐵𝑟𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑎 𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑎 (cabbage) and 𝐵𝑟𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑐𝑎 𝑗𝑢𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑎 (mustard). (iii) 𝑃𝑎𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑎 𝑙𝑒𝑜 (lion) and 𝑃𝑎𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑎 𝑡𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑠 (tiger).
What are intermediate categories?,"With the discovery of more organisms it is difficult to adjust them to traditional categories. So, the existing categories have been split by prefixing ‘super’ and ‘sub’ to the existing categories like sub-kingdom, sub-phylum, super class etc. These are referred as intermediate categories. This has also facilitated more sound and scientific placement of various taxa."
Write a short note on botanical garden. Name some botanical gardens. Botanical gardens are living herbaria. Comment.,"(i) A botanical garden is a place for growing flowers for educational purposes for scientific workers. (ii) It is also an inspiration for general public to create their interest in plant life. (iii) It displays different varieties of cultivated plants, medicinal plants and other economic values. (iv) A botanical garden also has a herbarium and a library for reference studies. (v) They are basic sources of information about different types of plants. Some of these gardens are as follows: (i) Royal Botanical Garden, Kew (England) (ii) National Botanical Garden, (Lucknow) (iii) Indian Botanical Garden, (Kolkata) (iv) Lloyd Botanical Garden, (Darjeeling)."
What are taxonomic aids? Name a few taxonomic aids.,"Taxonomic aids: Techniques, procedures and information collected about the species that facilitate, identification, naming and classification of organisms are called taxonomic aids. Some aids are Herbaria, Botanical gardens, zoological parks etc. "
Describe the role of museums.,(i) These have collections of plants and animals. (ii) These are used to deposit type specimens. (iii) These are important centers for taxonomic studies. (iv) These provide information about local fauna and flora as well as of other areas.
Name some zoological parks.,(i) Zoological park of Kruger (S. Africa). (ii) Zoological garden of Berlin (Germany). (iii) Zoo of Kolkata. (iv) Aquarium of Mumbai.
Describe the taxonomic aids useful in identification of species.,"Flora, manuals, monographs and catalogues are some of the taxonomic aids. (i) Flora contains the useful account of habitat and distribution of plants of a given area. These provide the index to the plant species found in a particular area. (i) Manuals are useful in providing information for the identification of names of species found in an area. (iii) Monographs contain all the information about a particular taxon. (iv) Catalogue is a list that enumerates all the species found in a particular area."
How different specimens are preserved in the museums.,In museums specimens can be preserved in the following ways: (i) Most of the specimens are preserved in the containers or jars in preservative solutions. (ii) Some specimens are preserved in the dried form. (ii) Insects are preserved in insect boxes. (iv) Larger animals like birds and mammals are usually stuffed and then preserved. (v) Museums also have skeletons of animals as specimen.
