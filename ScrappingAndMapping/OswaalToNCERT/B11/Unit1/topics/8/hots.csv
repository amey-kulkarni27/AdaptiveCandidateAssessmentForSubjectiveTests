Write about cellular autonomy in unicellular organisms.,All cells are autonomous because of the following facts: (i) Each and every cell converts non-living materials into components of living matter. (ii) Each cell builds up its own macromolecules from micromolecules. (iii) All cells obtain or manufacture food. (iv) A cell is always building a new structure to
What are the factors which set the limit of cell size?,The factors which set the limit of cell size or volume are: (i) Nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio which determines the range of control of metabolic activities by nucleus. (ii) Ability of oxygen and other materials to reach every part of cell. (iii) Ability of waste products to pass to the outside. (iv) Rate of metabolic activity. (v) Rate of surface area to the volume of the cell.
What is cytoplasmic streaming? How many types of streaming are there?,They did not explain the rise of new cells. Rudolph Virchow modified it and stated that cells arise from the pre-existing cells.
A student collected water sample from water body and took it to the bio lab. There he observed that it had microorganisms in it. He observed one organism with small extension whole over the body and one organism with few long extension over the body. According to above information what extensions are these and explain about it.,"Short extensions are cilia; long extensions are flagella. Cilia are short and numerous. Hair like cilia beat like tiny oars or pedals. Flagella are much longer, fewer and bring about whip-like lashing movement."
What do you understand by cellular totipotency? Where it is used?,Cellular totipotency is the ability of a living somatic nucleated cell to form the complete organism. All somatic cells should be totipotent since they carry the full gene complement of the individual. Cellular totipotency is being extensively used in: (i) Rapid multiplication of desired plant. (ii) Embryo which fail to reach maturity. (iii) Multiplication of sterile hybrids. (iv) Production of virus free plants. (v) Multiplication of products of protoplast fusion. (vi) Induction and selection o f mutants. (vii) Development of resistance to chemicals like weedicides. 
Why nucleolus is larger in actively working cell?,"Every cell membrane has some receptor over it, which perceives the drugs and this stimulate cascade effects in cell and disease is cured.  "
