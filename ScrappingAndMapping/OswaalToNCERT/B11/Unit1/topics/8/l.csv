Discuss the modern concept of cell theory.   ,Modern cell theory is also known as cell doctrine or cell principle. This theory states that: (i) The bodies of all living beings are made up of cells and their products. (ii) Cells are the structural and functional units of living organisms. (iii) Life exists only in cells because all the activities of life are performed by cells. (iv) Each cell maintains its individuality. It has a specific internal environment and homeostasis. (v) Growth of an organism involves the growth and multiplication of its cell. New cells arise from pre-existing cells through division.

What are the methods of passage of substances across the cell membrane?,"The passage of substances across the cell membrane occurs by three methods :  (i) Passive transport: It is a mode of membrane transport which occurs without the expenditure of cell energy. Passive transport occurs by diffusion or osmosis. Neutral solutes may move across the membrane by the process of simple diffusion along the concentration gradient. Osmosis is a special type of diffusion in which only water molecules migrate across a semipermeable membrane from the area of high concentration to the area of low concentration. (ii) Active transport: It is the movement of materials across the membrane against the concentration gradient. This often leads to accumulation of substances at a higher concentration within the cell than outside. Energy is required for such a process, which is usually provided by ATP. There are certain proteins in the membrane, which acts as a carrier molecules or carrier proteins. It has a binding site for the substrate. This transports the carrier bound substrate to other side of the membrane. (iii) Bulk transport: It includes exocytosis and endocytosis, which are the processes for active cellular extrusion and intake respectively of such materials that cannot pass through the unbroken plasma membrane. Both the processes involve movement and folding of the membrane, which depends on its fluidity and mobility."

(ii) These are found either in free state in the cytoplasm or attached to the endoplasmic reticulum. (iii) The ribosomes found in mitochondrial matrix and chloroplast stroma are of 70S type. (iv) Ribosomes are commonly called as cell engines as they are the sites of protein synthesis.  ùëú ùëú to 250 in diameter. Ribosomes are composed of roughly equal amount of protein and RNA. (v) under electron microscope, they appear as spherical bodies of about 150  (vi) The ribosomes consist of two unequal sized units arranged on top of each other. The eukaryotic cells have large ribosomes than prokaryotic cells. (vii) The prokaryotic ribosomes are 70S while the eukaryotic ribosomes are 80S type. 70S ribosomes have two sub-units 50S and 30S while 80S ribosome have larger 60S and smaller 40S subunit."
What are the three structural elements of endoplasmic reticulum ? Explain in brief.,"ER is an inner connected system of membrane- bound channels in the cytoplasm of the cells. There are three structural elements of ER : (i) Cisternae: The cisternae are broad flat membrane bound space arranged parallel to each other to form lamellae. e.g., Pancreas and liver cells. (ii) Vesicles: The vesicles are spherical spaces (25-500 nm in diameter). (iii) Tubules: The tubules are less small and branched tubular spaces found in cells which synthesize steroids and are 50-100 nm in diameter. "

What are plastids? How are they classified?,"Plastids are semi-autonomous organelles having DNA and double membrane envelope which store or synthesize various types of organic compounds. Depending upon their colour, plastids are of three types: (i) Leucoplast: They are colourless plastids of varied shapes and sizes with stored nutrients occurs near the nucleus and possess internal lamellae. Leucoplast are of three types: starch containing amyloplast, fats storing elaioplast and proteins bearing proteinoplast. Grana and photosynthetic pigments are absent in leucoplast. (ii) Chromoplast: These are coloured plastids with reddish and yellow colours because of the presence of carotenoid pigments. The pigments are often found in crystallised state so that the shape of the plastids can be like needles, spindles or irregular. These provide colour to many flowers for attracting pollinating insects. They are also the site of synthesis of membrane lipids. (iii) Chloroplast: They are green plastids which possess photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll and carotenoids, and take part in the synthesis of food from inorganic raw materials in the presence of radiation energy."
