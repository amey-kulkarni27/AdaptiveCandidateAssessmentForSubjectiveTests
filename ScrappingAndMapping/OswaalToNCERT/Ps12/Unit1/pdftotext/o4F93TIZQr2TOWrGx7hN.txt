Long Answer Questions

Q. 1. What is Pollution? Highlight some of its impacts.

The various effects are:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
v.
vi.

vii.
viii.
ix.

Effects on our nervous system.
Emotional effects: It produces discomfort, decreased work efficiency, lowered
interest in the job and increase in the anxiety level.
Presence of dust particles may produce suffocation, respiratory disorders and
problems in focussing of attention.
People in industrial areas report greater tension and anxiety than in rural areas.
The presence of sulphur-dioxide in the air decreases the ability to concentrate on
a task lowering performance efficiency.

and alertness.
Tobacco intake can cause lung cancer to smokers or passive smokers and other
serious psychological effects such as increase the aggression level in individuals.
Polluting substances in water and soil are hazardous for physical health and may
even cause mental retardation by affecting brain development.

Q. 2. How humans influence environment?
Ans. Human beings influence environment by the following ways:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
v.
vi.

Noise pollution, crowding and natural disasters are examples of environmental
stressors that create stress in human beings.

Q. 3. What are the effects of noise on human behaviour?

[CBSE (AI) 2016]

Ans. Any annoying or irritating sound or exposure to noise can create unpleasant
mood, hearing loss, negative effects on mental activity due to lack of concentration. The
effects of noise on human behaviour are:
i.

ii.
iii.

iv.

v.
vi.
vii.

Simple task: When the task being performed is a simple mental task such as
addition of numbers, noise does not affect overall performance whether it is loud
or soft. In such situations, people adapt or ‘get used’ to noise.
Interesting task: If the task being performed is very interesting, the presence of
noise does not affect performance.
Predictability of noise: When the noise comes at intervals and in an
unpredictable way, it is experienced more disturbing than if the noise is
continuously present.
Difficulty of task: When the task being performed is difficult, or requires full
concentration, then intense, unpredictable, and uncontrollable noise reduces the
level of task performance.
Controllability of noise: When tolerating or switching off the noise is within the
control of the person, the number of errors in task performance decreases.
Intensity of noise: Above a certain level noise can lead to annoyance or even
sleep disturbances.
Emotional effects of loud noise: Noise above a certain level causes
annoyance, and can also lead to sleep disturbance.

Q. 4. Give the effects of crowding on human behaviour.
OR
Explain the major consequences of crowding.
2015]

[CBSE (AI)

Ans.
i.

ii.
iii.
iv.

v.

Crowding and high density may lead to abnormal behavior and aggression. For
example, rats in a highly populated enclosed space show aggressive behaviour
such as biting the tails of other rats.
Crowding leads to lowered performance on different tasks that involve cognitive
processes and has adverse effects on memory and emotional state.
Children growing up in very crowded households show lower academic
performance and experience greater conflict with their parents.
The nature of social interaction determines the degree to which an individual will
react to crowding. For example, if the interaction is a party, the presence of large
number of people does not cause stress.
In cultures that emphasize the importance of the group or collectivity over the
individual, the presence of large number of people is not considered undesirable
while in cultures where individualism is given more importance, crowding is
experienced as stressful.

Q. 5. What are the effects of natural disasters?
Ans. The effects of natural disasters such as tsunamis, floods, cyclones and
volcanic eruptions are:
i.
ii.

They leave people poverty-stricken, homeless, without any resources, usually

The sudden loss of all their belongingness as well as their dear ones leaves
people shocked and stunned.

This causes a disorder called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The
features of PTSD are:
i.
ii.

iii.

iv.

v.

People become disoriented by denying to themselves that something terrible has
happened.
Physical reactions such as difficulty in sleeping, change in the eating pattern,
increased heart-beat and blood pressure and getting startled easily is found
among the victims.
Emotional reactions such as grief and fear, irritability, anger, helplessness,
depression, sometimes absolute lack of emotion, guilt feelings for having
survived while someone else in the family died, blaming oneself, and lack of
interest in even routine activities.

the event.

Intensity of reaction in PTSD is affected by:
i.
ii.
iii.

Severity of the disorder and loss incurred both in terms of property and life.

Stressful experiences before the disaster. For example people who have
experienced stress before may find it more difficult to deal with yet another
difficult and stressful situation.

Treatment of psychological disorders

a. This involves providing material relief in the form of food, clothing, medical help,

Q. 8. Mention the areas where poverty and deprivation have an adverse effect.
Ans. The effects of poverty and deprivation are:
i.

ii.

iii.

The poor have low aspirations and low achievement motivation and high need for
dependence. They explain their successes in terms of luck or fate rather than
anxiety or hard work.
The poor and deprived have low self-esteem, are high on anxiety and
introversion, dwell on the immediate present rather than the future. They prefer
smaller immediate rewards rather than larger ones. They live with a sense of
hopelessness, powerlessness, feel injustice and experience a loss of identity.

society.

iv.
v.

Intellectual functioning and performance on cognitive tasks is low.
The poor are more likely to suffer from mental illness due to constant worries
about basic necessities, feelings of insecurity and inability to get medical
facilities. The poor suffer from emotional and adjustment problems due to their
experience of a sense of hopelessness and loss of identity as though they do not
belong to society.

Q. 9. What are the causes of poverty?
Opinions of masses regarding the people suffering from poverty are:
i.
ii.

iii.

iv.

v.

Poor themselves are responsible for their poverty. Poor lack the ability and
motivation to put in effort and make use of available opportunities.
The belief system called ‘the culture of poverty’ convinces the person that
she/he will continue to remain poor and the belief is carried from one generation
of the poor to the next.
Economic, social and political factors account for poverty. Because of
discrimination, certain sectors of society are denied the opportunities needed for
getting even the basic necessities of life. The poor being the socially
disadvantaged group experience social injustice, deprivation and exclusion.
The geographic region is a cause of poverty. People living in deserts that have
shortage of natural resources or in regions where there is harsh climate such as
extreme heat or cold end up being poor.
Poverty cycle in which poverty begets poverty explains why poverty continues
among the same sections of society. Due to low income and lack of resources,
the poor go through low health and nutrition, lack of education and lack of skills.
This leads to low employment opportunities, which, in turn, continue their low
income condition, and low health and nutrition status. The resulting lowered
motivational level only makes the situation worse; the cycle starts and continues
again.

them from getting attractive toys that are visible through a screen. These children

are found to be more destructive than those children who are allowed to access
the toys.
