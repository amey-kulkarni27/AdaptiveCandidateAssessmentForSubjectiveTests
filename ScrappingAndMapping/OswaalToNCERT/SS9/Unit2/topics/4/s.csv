What is the significance of India’s central location?,"India is a south west extension of the Asian continent. The trans Indian Ocean routes which connect the countries of Europe in the west and the countries of East Asia provide a strategic central location to India. The Deccan Plateau protrudes into the Indian Ocean, thus helping India to establish close contact with West Asia, Africa and Europe from the western coast and East Asia and Southeast from the eastern coast."
What do you know about the size of India?,"The land mass of India has an area of 3.28 million sq. kms. India’s total area accounts for about 2.4 per cent of the total geographical area of the world. India is the seventh largest country of the world starting with Russia, Canada, USA, China, Brazil, Australia and India. India has a land boundary of about 15,200 km. The total length of the coastline of the mainland including Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep is 7,576.6 kms."
Why is the difference between the durations of day and night hardly felt at Kanyakumari but not so in Kashmir?,"These places do not have the same duration of day and night. The circle of illumination divides the Equator into two equal parts. The days and nights are, therefore, of the same duration at the equator. As Kanyakumari is quite near the equator, the day-night difference is hardly one hour there. But as we move away from the equator towards the poles, the variations in the duration of day and night becomes greater. It is because of the unequal division of the parallels of latitude by the circle of illumination. Kashmir is over 30° away from the equator and so the difference in duration of day and night is over four hours there."
What are India’s unique locational features? ,"(i) India lies completely on the north of the equator. So it is situated in the Northern Hemisphere.
