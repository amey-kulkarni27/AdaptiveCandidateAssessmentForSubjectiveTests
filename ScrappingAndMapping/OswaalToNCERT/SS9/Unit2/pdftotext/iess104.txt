CLIMATE

I

n the last two chapters you have read about
the landforms and the drainage of
our country. These are the two of the three
basic elements that one learns about the natural
environment of any area. In this chapter you
will learn about the third, that is, the
atmospheric conditions that prevail over our
country. Why do we wear woollens in December
or why it is hot and uncomfortable in the month
of May, and why it rains in June - July? The
answers to all these questions can be found out
by studying about the climate of India.
Climate refers to the sum total of weather
conditions and variations over a large area for
a long period of time (more than thirty years).
Weather refers to the state of the atmosphere
over an area at any point of time. The elements
of weather and climate are the same, i.e.
temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind,
humidity and precipitation. You may have
observed that the weather conditions fluctuate
very often even within a day. But there is some
common pattern over a few weeks or months,
i.e. days are cool or hot, windy or calm, cloudy
or bright, and wet or dry. On the basis of the
generalised monthly atmospheric conditions,
the year is divided into seasons such as winter,
summer or rainy seasons.
The world is divided into a number of
climatic regions. Do you know what type of
climate India has and why it is so? We will
learn about it in this chapter.
• The word monsoon is
derived from the Arabic word ‘mausim’ which
literally means season.
• ‘Monsoon’ refers to the seasonal reversal in the
wind direction during a year.

The climate of India is described as the
‘monsoon’ type. In Asia, this type of climate
is found mainly in the south and the southeast.
Despite an overall unity in the general pattern,
there are perceptible regional variations in
climatic conditions within the country. Let us
take two important elements – temperature and
precipitation, and examine how they vary from
place to place and season to season.
In summer, the mercury occasionally
touches 50°C in some parts of the Rajasthan
desert, whereas it may be around 20°C in
Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir. On a winter
night, temperature at Drass in Jammu and
Kashmir may be as low as minus 45°C.
Thiruvananthapuram, on the other hand, may
have a temperature of 22°C.
In certain places there is a
wide difference between day and night
temperatures. In the Thar Desert the day
temperature may rise to 50°C, and drop down
to near 15°C the same night. On the other hand,
there is hardly any difference in day and night
temperatures in the Andaman and Nicobar
islands or in Kerala.

Let us now look at precipitation. There are
variations not only in the form and types of
precipitation but also in its amount and the
seasonal distribution. While precipitation is
mostly in the form of snowfall in the upper parts
of Himalayas, it rains over the rest of the
country. The annual precipitation varies from
over 400 cm in Meghalaya to less than 10 cm
in Ladakh and western Rajasthan. Most parts
of the country receive rainfall from June to
September. But some parts like the Tamil Nadu

2021–22

coast gets a large portion of its rain during
October and November.
In general, coastal areas experience less
contrasts in temperature conditions. Seasonal
contrasts are more in the interior of the
country. There is decrease in rainfall generally
from east to west in the Northern Plains. These
variations have given rise to variety in lives of
people – in terms of the food they eat, the
clothes they wear and also the kind of houses
they live in.

• Why most of the world’s deserts are
located in the western margins of continents in the
subtropics?

Finally, relief too plays a major role in
determining the climate of a place. High mountains
act as barriers for cold or hot winds; they may
also cause precipitation if they are high enough
and lie in the path of rain-bearing winds. The
leeward side of mountains remains relatively dry.

FACTORS AFFECTING INDIA’S CLIMATE

Why the houses in Rajasthan have thick
walls and flat roofs?
• Why is it that the houses in the Tarai region and
in Goa and Mangalore have sloping roofs?
• Why houses in Assam are built on stilts?

Latitude

CLIMATIC CONTROLS
There are six major controls of the climate of
any place. They are: latitude, altitude,
pressure and wind system, distance from
the sea (continentality), ocean currents and
relief features.
Due to the curvature of the earth, the
amount of solar energy received varies
according to latitude. As a result, air
temperature generally decreases from the
equator towards the poles. As one goes from
the surface of the earth to higher altitudes,
the atmosphere becomes less dense and
temperature decreases. The hills are therefore
cooler during summers. The pressure and
wind system of any area depend on the
latitude and altitude of the place. Thus it
influences the temperature and rainfall
pattern. The sea exerts a moderating influence
on climate: As the distance from the sea
increases, its moderating influence decreases
and the people experience extreme weather
conditions. This condition is known as
continentality (i.e. very hot during summers
and very cold during winters). Ocean currents
along with onshore winds affect the climate of
the coastal areas, For example, any coastal
area with warm or cold currents flowing past
it, will be warmed or cooled if the winds are
onshore.

The Tropic of Cancer passes through the middle
of the country from the Rann of Kuchchh in the
west to Mizoram in the east. Almost half of the
country, lying south of the Tropic of Cancer,
belongs to the tropical area. All the remaining
area, north of the Tropic, lies in the sub-tropics.
Therefore, India’s climate has characteristics of
tropical as well as subtropical climates.
Altitude
India has mountains to the north, which have
an average height of about 6,000 metres. India
also has a vast coastal area where the
maximum elevation is about 30 metres. The
Himalayas prevent the cold winds from Central
Asia from entering the subcontinent. It is
because of these mountains that this
subcontinent experiences comparatively
milder winters as compared to central Asia.
Pressure and Winds
The climate and associated weather conditions
in India are governed by the following
atmospheric conditions:
•
•
•

Pressure and surface winds;
Upper air circulation; and
Western cyclonic disturbances and
tropical cyclones.

India lies in the region of north easterly
winds. These winds originate from the
subtropical high-pressure belt of the northern

27

CLIMATE

2021–22

hemisphere. They blow southwards, get
deflected to the right due to the Coriolis force,
and move towards the equatorial low-pressure
area. Generally, these winds carry little
moisture as they originate and blow over land.
Therefore, they bring little or no rain. Hence,
India should have been an arid land, but it is
not so. Let us see why?
Coriolis force: An apparent force caused by the earth’s
rotation. The Coriolis force is responsible for deflecting
winds towards the right in the northern hemisphere
and towards the left in the southern hemisphere. This
is also known as ‘Ferrel’s Law’.

The pressure and wind conditions over
India are unique. During winter, there is a
high-pressure area north of the Himalayas.
Cold dry winds blow from this region to the
low-pressure areas over the oceans to the
south. In summer, a low-pressure area
develops over interior Asia, as well as, over
northwestern India. This causes a complete
reversal of the direction of winds during
summer. Air moves from the high-pressure
area over the southern Indian Ocean, in a
south-easterly direction, crosses the equator,
and turns right towards the low-pressure areas
over the Indian subcontinent. These are known
as the Southwest Monsoon winds. These winds
blow over the warm oceans, gather moisture
and bring widespread rainfall over the
mainland of India.
The upper air circulation in this region is
dominated by a westerly flow. An important
component of this flow is the jet stream.
These jet streams are located approximately
over 27°-30° north latitude, therefore, they are
known as subtropical westerly jet streams. Over
India, these jet streams blow south of the

Himalayas, all through the year except in
summer. The western cyclonic disturbances
experienced in the north and north-western parts
of the country are brought in by this westerly
flow. In summer, the subtropical westerly jet
stream moves north of the Himalayas with the
apparent movement of the sun. An easterly jet
stream, called the sub-tropical easterly jet stream
blows over peninsular India, approximately over
14°N during the summer months.
Western Cyclonic Disturbances
The western cyclonic disturbances are weather
phenomena of the winter months brought in by the
westerly flow from the Mediterranean region. They
usually influence the weather of the north and
north-western regions of India. Tropical cyclones
occur during the monsoon, as well as, in
October – November, and are part of the easterly
flow. These disturbances affect the coastal regions
of the country. Have you read or heard about the
disasters caused by them on Odisha and Andhra
Pradesh coast?

THE INDIAN MONSOON
The climate of India is strongly influenced by
monsoon winds. The sailors who came to India
in historic times were one of the first to have
noticed the phenomenon of the monsoon. They
benefited from the reversal of the wind system
as they came by sailing ships at the mercy of
winds. The Arabs, who had also come to India
as traders named this seasonal reversal of the
wind system ‘monsoon’.

Jet stream: These are a narrow belt of high
altitude (above 12,000 m) westerly winds in the
troposphere. Their speed varies from about 110
km/h in summer to about 184 km/h in winter.
A number of separate jet streams have been
identified. The most constant are the mid-latitude
and the sub-tropical jet stream.

The monsoons are experienced in the
tropical area roughly between 20° N and 20°
S. To understand the mechanism of the
monsoons, the following facts are important.
(a) The differential heating and cooling of
land and water creates low pressure on the
landmass of India while the seas around
experience comparatively high pressure.
(b) The shift of the position of Inter Tropical
Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in summer, over
the Ganga plain (this is the equatorial trough
normally positioned about 5°N of the
equator. It is also known as the monsoontrough during the monsoon season).
(c) The presence of the high-pressure area,
east of Madagascar, approximately at
20°S over the Indian Ocean. The intensity
and position of this high-pressure area
affects the Indian Monsoon.
(d) The Tibetan plateau gets intensely
heated during summer, which results in
strong vertical air currents and the
formation of low pressure over the plateau
at about 9 km above sea level.
(e) The movement of the westerly jet stream
to the north of the Himalayas and the
presence of the tropical easterly jet
stream over the Indian peninsula during
summer.
Inter Tropical Convergence Zone
The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ,) is a
broad trough of low pressure in equatorial
latitudes. This is where the northeast and the
southeast trade winds converge. This
convergence zone lies more or less parallel to
the equator but moves north or south with the
apparent movement of the sun.

Apart from this, it has also been noticed that
changes in the pressure conditions over the
southern oceans also affect the monsoons.
Normally when the tropical eastern south Pacific
Ocean experiences high pressure, the tropical
eastern Indian Ocean experiences low pressure.
But in certain years, there is a reversal in the
pressure conditions and the eastern Pacific has
lower pressure in comparison to the eastern
Indian Ocean. This periodic change in pressure

conditions is known as the Southern
Oscillation or SO. The difference in pressure
over Tahiti (Pacific Ocean, 18°S/149°W) and
Darwin in northern Australia (Indian Ocean,
12°30’S/131°E) is computed to predict the
intensity of the monsoons. If the pressure
differences were negative, it would mean below
average and late monsoons. A feature connected
with the SO is the El Nino phenomenon in which
a warm ocean current that flows past the
Peruvian Coast, in place of the cold Peruvian
current, every 2 to 5 years. The changes in
pressure conditions are connected to the El Nino.
Hence, the phenomenon is referred to as ENSO
(El Nino Southern Oscillations).
El Nino: This is a name given to the periodic
development of a warm ocean current along the
coast of Peru as a temporary replacement of the
cold Peruvian current. ‘El Nino’ is a Spanish word
meaning ‘the child’, and refers to the baby Christ,
as this current starts flowing during Christmas.
The presence of the El Nino leads to an increase
in sea-surface temperatures and weakening of
the trade winds in the region.

THE ONSET OF THE MONSOON AND WITHDRAWAL
The Monsoon, unlike the trades, are not steady
winds but are pulsating in nature, affected by
different atmospheric conditions encountered
by it, on its way over the warm tropical seas.
The duration of the monsoon is between 100120 days from early June to mid-September.
Around the time of its arrival, the normal
rainfall increases suddenly and continues
constantly for several days. This is known as
the ‘burst’ of the monsoon, and can be
distinguished from the pre-monsoon showers.
The monsoon arrives at the southern tip of the
Indian peninsula generally by the first week of
June. Subsequently, it proceeds into two – the
Arabian Sea branch and the Bay of Bengal
branch. The Arabian Sea branch reaches
Mumbai about ten days later on
approximately the 10th of June. This is a fairly
rapid advance. The Bay of Bengal branch also
advances rapidly and arrives in Assam in the
first week of June. The lofty mountains causes
the monsoon winds to deflect towards the west

30

CONTEMPORARY INDIA-I

over the Ganga plains. By mid-June the
Arabian Sea branch of the monsoon arrives
over Saurashtra-Kuchchh and the central part
of the country. The Arabian Sea and the Bay
of Bengal branches of the monsoon merge over
the northwestern part of the Ganga plains.
Delhi generally receives the monsoon showers
from the Bay of Bengal branch by the end of
June (tentative date is 29th of June). By the first
week of July, western Uttar Pradesh, Punjab,
Haryana and eastern Rajasthan experience the
monsoon. By mid-July, the monsoon reaches
Himachal Pradesh and the rest of the country
(Figure 4.3).
Withdrawal or the retreat of the monsoon
is a more gradual process (Figure 4.4). The
withdrawal of the monsoon begins in
northwestern states of India by early
September. By mid-October, it withdraws
completely from the northern half of the
peninsula. The withdrawal from the southern
half of the peninsula is fairly rapid. By early
December, the monsoon has withdrawn from
the rest of the country.
The islands receive the very first monsoon
showers, progressively from south to north,
from the last week of April to the first week of
May. The withdrawal, takes place progressively
from north to south from the first week of
December to the first week of January. By this
time the rest of the country is already under
the influence of the winter monsoon.

THE SEASONS
The monsoon type of climate is characterised
by a distinct seasonal pattern. The weather
conditions greatly change from one season to
the other. These changes are particularly
noticeable in the interior parts of the country.
The coastal areas do not experience much
variation in temperature though there is
variation in rainfall pattern. How many seasons
are experienced in your place? Four main
seasons can be identified in India – the cold
weather season, the hot weather season, the
advancing monsoon and the retreating
monsoon with some regional variations.

The Cold Weather Season (Winter)
The cold weather season begins from midNovember in northern India and stays till
February. December and January are the
coldest months in the northern part of India.
The temperature decreases from south to the
north. The average temperature of Chennai, on
the eastern coast, is between 24° – 25° Celsius,
while in the northern plains, it ranges between
10°C and 15° Celsius. Days are warm and
nights are cold. Frost is common in the north
and the higher slopes of the Himalayas
experience snowfall.
During this season, the northeast trade
winds prevail over the country. They blow from
land to sea and hence, for most part of the
country, it is a dry season. Some amount of
rainfall occurs on the Tamil Nadu coast from
these winds as, here they blow from sea to land.
In the northern part of the country, a feeble
high-pressure region develops, with light winds
moving outwards from this area. Influenced by
the relief, these winds blow through the Ganga
valley from the west and the northwest. The
weather is normally marked by clear sky, low
temperatures and low humidity and feeble,
variable winds.
A characteristic feature of the cold weather
season over the northern plains is the inflow of
cyclonic disturbances from the west and the
northwest. These low-pressure systems,
originate over the Mediterranean Sea and
western Asia and move into India, along with
the westerly flow. They cause the much-needed
winter rains over the plains and snowfall in the
mountains. Although the total amount of
winter rainfall locally known as ‘mahawat’ is
small, they are of immense importance for the
cultivation of ‘rabi’ crops.
The peninsular region does not have a welldefined cold season. There is hardly any
noticeable seasonal change in temperature
pattern during winters due to the moderating
influence of the sea.
The Hot Weather Season (Summer)
Due to the apparent northward movement of the
sun, the global heat belt shifts northwards. As
such, from March to May, it is hot weather season

CLIMATE

in India. The influence of the shifting of the heat
belt can be seen clearly from temperature
recordings taken during March-May at different
latitudes. In March, the highest temperature is
about 38° Celsius, recorded on the Deccan
plateau. In April, temperatures in Gujarat and
Madhya Pradesh are around 42° Celsius. In May,
temperature of 45° Celsius is common in the
northwestern parts of the country. In peninsular
India, temperatures remain lower due to the
moderating influence of the oceans.
The summer months experience rising
temperature and falling air pressure in the
northern part of the country. Towards the end
of May, an elongated low-pressure area
develops in the region extending from the Thar
Desert in the northwest to Patna and
Chotanagpur plateau in the east and
southeast. Circulation of air begins to set in
around this trough.
A striking feature of the hot weather season
is the ‘loo’. These are strong, gusty, hot, dry
winds blowing during the day over the north and
northwestern India. Sometimes they even
continue until late in the evening. Direct exposure
to these winds may even prove to be fatal. Dust
storms are very common during the month of
May in northern India. These storms bring
temporary relief as they lower the temperature
and may bring light rain and cool breeze. This is
also the season for localised thunderstorms,
associated with violent winds, torrential
downpours, often accompanied by hail. In West
Bengal, these storms are known as the ‘Kaal
Baisakhi’.
Towards the close of the summer season,
pre-monsoon showers are common especially,
in Kerala and Karnataka. They help in the early
ripening of mangoes, and are often referred to
as ‘mango showers’.
Advancing Monsoon (The Rainy Season)
By early June, the low-pressure condition over
the northern plains intensifies. It attracts, the
trade winds of the southern hemisphere. These
south-east trade winds originate over the
warm subtropical areas of the southern oceans.
They cross the equator and blow in a south-

westerly direction entering the Indian peninsula
as the south-west monsoon. As these winds
blow over warm oceans, they bring abundant
moisture to the subcontinent. These winds are
strong and blow at an average velocity of 30
km per hour. With the exception of the extreme
north-west, the monsoon winds cover the
country in about a month.
The inflow of the south-west monsoon into
India brings about a total change in the
weather. Early in the season, the windward
side of the Western Ghats receives very heavy
rainfall, more than 250 cm. The Deccan
Plateau and parts of Madhya Pradesh also
receive some amount of rain in spite of lying
in the rain shadow area. The maximum rainfall
of this season is received in the north-eastern
part of the country. Mawsynram in the
southern ranges of the Khasi Hills receives the
highest average rainfall in the world. Rainfall
in the Ganga valley decreases from the east to
the west. Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat get
scanty rainfall.
Another phenomenon associated with the
monsoon is its tendency to have ‘breaks’ in
rainfall. Thus, it has wet and dry spells. In
other words, the monsoon rains take place
only for a few days at a time. They are
interspersed with rainless intervals. These
breaks in monsoon are related to the
movement of the monsoon trough. For
various reasons, the trough and its axis keep
on moving northward or southward, which
determines the spatial distribution of rainfall.
When the axis of the monsoon trough lies over
the plains, rainfall is good in these parts. On
the other hand, whenever the axis shifts closer
to the Himalayas, there are longer dry spells
in the plains, and widespread rain occur in
the mountainous catchment areas of the
Himalayan rivers. These heavy rains bring in
their wake, devastating floods causing
damage to life and property in the plains. The
f r e q u e n c y a n d i n t e n s i t y o f t ropi cal
depressions too, determine the amount and
d u r a t i o n o f m o n s o o n r a i n s . Th ese
depressions form at the head of the Bay of
Bengal and cross over to the mainland. The
depressions follow the axis of the “monsoon

trough of low pressure”. The monsoon is
known for its uncertainties. The alternation
of dry and wet spells vary in intensity,
frequency and duration. While it causes heavy
floods in one part, it may be responsible for
droughts in the other. It is often irregular in
its arrival and its retreat. Hence, it sometimes
disturbs the farming schedule of millions of
farmers all over the country.
Retreating/Post Monsoons
(The Transition Season)
During October-November, with the apparent
movement of the sun towards the south, the
monsoon trough or the low-pressure trough
over the northern plains becomes weaker. This
is gradually replaced by a high-pressure
system. The south-west monsoon winds
weaken and start withdrawing gradually. By
the beginning of October, the monsoon
withdraws from the Northern Plains.
The months of October-November form a
period of transition from hot rainy season to
dry winter conditions. The retreat of the
monsoon is marked by clear skies and rise in
Mawsynram, the wettest
place on the earth is also reputed for its
stalagmite and stalactite caves.

deltas of the Godavari, the Krishna and the
Kaveri are frequently struck by cyclones, which
cause great damage to life and property.
Sometimes, these cyclones arrive at the coasts
of Odisha, West Bengal and Bangladesh. The
bulk of the rainfall of the Coromandel Coast is
derived from depressions and cyclones.

DISTRIBUTION OF RAINFALL
Parts of western coast and northeastern India
receive over about 400 cm of rainfall annually.
However, it is less than 60 cm in western
Rajasthan and adjoining parts of Gujarat,
Haryana and Punjab. Rainfall is equally low
in the interior of the Deccan plateau, and east
of the Sahyadris. Why do these regions receive
low rainfall? A third area of low precipitation
is around Leh in Jammu and Kashmir. The rest
of the country receives moderate rainfall.
Snowfall is restricted to the Himalayan region.
Owing to the nature of monsoons, the
annual rainfall is highly variable from year to
year. Variability is high in the regions of low
rainfall, such as parts of Rajasthan, Gujarat
and the leeward side of the Western Ghats. As
such, while areas of high rainfall are liable to
be affected by floods, areas of low rainfall are
drought-prone (Figure 4.6 and 4.7).

MONSOON AS A UNIFYING BOND
temperature. While day temperatures are
high, nights are cool and pleasant. The land
is still moist. Owing to the conditions of high
temperature and humidity, the weather
becomes rather oppressive during the day.
This is commonly known as ‘October heat’. In
the second half of October, the mercury begins
to fall rapidly in northern India.
The low-pressure conditions, over northwestern India, get transferred to the Bay of
Bengal by early November. This shift is
associated with the occurrence of cyclonic
depressions, which originate over the
Andaman Sea. These cyclones generally cross
the eastern coasts of India cause heavy and
widespread rain. These tropical cyclones are
often very destructive. The thickly populated

You have alr eady known the way the
Himalayas protect the subcontinent from
extremely cold winds from central Asia. This
enables northern India to have uniformly
higher temperatures compared to other areas
on the same latitudes. Similarly, the
Peninsular plateau, under the influence of the
sea from three sides, has moderate
temperatures. Despite such moderating
influences, there are great variations in the
temperature conditions. Nevertheless, the
unifying influence of the monsoon on the
Indian subcontinent is quite perceptible. The
seasonal alteration of the wind systems and
the associated weather conditions provide a
rhythmic cycle of seasons. Even the
uncertainties of rain and uneven distribution

its entire agricultural calendar and the life of
the people, including their festivities, revolve
around this phenomenon. Year after year,
people of India from north to south and from

east to west, eagerly await the arrival of the

4. Now find out
(i) Why are Thiruvananthapuram and Shillong rainier in June than in July?
(ii) Why is July rainier in Mumbai than in Thiruvananthapuram?
(iii) Why are southwest monsoons less rainy in Chennai?
(iv) Why is Shillong rainier than Kolkata?
(v) Why is Kolkata rainier in July than in June unlike Shillong which is rainier in June than
in July?
(vi) Why does Delhi receive more rain than Jodhpur?
5. Now think why
— Thiruvananthapuram has equable climate?
— Chennai has more rains only after the fury of monsoon is over in most parts of the country?
— Jodhpur has a hot desert type of climate?
— Leh has moderate precipitation almost throughut the year?
— while in Delhi and Jodhpur most of the rain is confined to nearly three months, in
Thiruvananthapuram and Shillong it is almost nine months of the year?
In spite of these facts see carefully if there are strong evidences to conclude that the monsoons
still provide a very strong framework lending overall climatic unity to the whole country.
