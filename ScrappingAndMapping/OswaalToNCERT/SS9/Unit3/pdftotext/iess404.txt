CHAPTER 4

Working of
Institutions

OVERVIEW
Democracy is not just about people electing their rulers. In a democracy
the rulers have to follow some rules and procedures. They have to work
with and within institutions. This chapter is about the working of such
institutions in a democracy. We try to understand this by looking at the
manner in which major decisions are taken and implemented in our
country. We also look at how disputes regarding these decisions are
resolved. In this process we come across three institutions that play a key
role in major decisions – legislature, executive and judiciary.
You have already read something about these institutions in earlier
classes. Here we shall quickly summarise those and move on to asking
larger questions. In the case of each institution we ask: What does this
institution do? How is this institution connected to other institutions?
What makes its functioning more or less democratic? The basic objective
here is to understand how all these institutions together carry on the
work of government. Sometimes we compare these with similar institutions
in other democracies. In this chapter we take our examples from the
working of the national level government called Central Government, Union
Government, or just Government of India. While reading this chapter, you
can think of and discuss examples from the working of the government in
your state.

4.1 HOW

IS A

MAJOR POLICY DECISION TAKEN?

A Government Order
On August 13, 1990, the Government
of India issued an Order. It was
called an Office Memorandum. Like
all government orders, it had a number and is known by that: O. M. No.
36012/31/90-Est (SCT), dated
13.8.1990. The Joint Secretary, an
officer in the Department of Personnel and Training in the Ministry of
Personnel, Public Grievances and

WORKING

OF

INSTITUTIONS

Pensions, signed the Order. It was
quite short, barely one page. It
looked like any ordinary circular or
notice that you may have seen in
school. The government issues hundreds of orders every day on different matters. But this one was very
important and became a source of
controversy for several years. Let us
see how the decision was taken and
what happened later.

2021-22

This Order announced a major
policy decision. It said that 27 per
cent of the vacancies in civil posts
and services under the Government
of India are reserved for the Socially
and Educationally Backward Classes
(SEBC). SEBC is another name for all
those people who belong to castes
that are considered backward by the
government. The benefit of job reservation was till then available only
to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes. Now a new third category
called SEBC was introduced. Only
persons who belong to backward
classes were eligible for this quota
of 27 per cent jobs. Others could not
compete for these jobs.

Who decided to issue this
Memorandum? Clearly, such a big
decision could not have been taken
by the person who signed that
document. The officer was merely
implementing the instructions given
by the Minister of Personnel, Public
Grievances and Pensions, of which
the Department was a part. We can
guess that such a major decision
would have involved other major
functionaries in our country. You
have already read in the previous
class about some of them. Let us go
over some of the main points that
you covered then:
< President is the head of the state
and is the highest formal authority
in the country.
< Prime Minister is the head of the
government and actually exercises
all governmental powers. He takes
most of the decisions in the
Cabinet meetings.
< Parliament
consists of the
President and two Houses, Lok
Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The Prime
Minister must have the support of
a majority of Lok Sabha members.

So, were all these people involved
in this decision regarding the Office
Memorandum? Let us find out.

A C T I V I T Y
Which points, other than the ones mentioned
above, do you recall about these institutions
from the previous class? Discuss in class.
< Can you think of a major decision made by
your state government? How were the Governor, the Council of Ministers, the state assembly and the courts involved in that decision?
<

This Office Memorandum was the
culmination of a long chain of
events. The Government of India had
appointed the Second Backward
Classes Commission in 1979. It was
headed by B.P. Mandal. Hence it was
popularly called the Mandal
Commission. It was asked to
determine the criteria to identify the
socially and educationally backward
classes in India and recommend
steps to be taken for their
advancement. The Commission gave
its Report in 1980 and made many
recommendations. One of these was
that 27 per cent of government jobs
be reserved for the socially and
educationally backward classes.
The Report and recommendations
were discussed in the Parliament.
For
several
years,
many
parliamentarians and parties kept
demanding the implementation of
the Commission’s recommendations.
Then came the Lok Sabha election
of 1989. In its election manifesto,
the Janata Dal promised that if voted
to power, it would implement the
Mandal Commission report. The
Janata Dal did form the government
after this election. Its leader V. P.
Singh became the Prime Minister.
Several developments took place
after that:

President of India in his
address to the Parliament
announced the intention of the
government to implement the
recommendations of the Mandal
Commission.
< On 6 August 1990, the Union
Cabinet took a formal decision to
implement the recommendations.
< Next day Prime Minister V.P. Singh
informed the Parliament about
this decision through a statement
in both the Houses of Parliament.
< The decision of the Cabinet was
sent to the Department of Personnel
and Training. The senior officers of
the Department drafted an order in
line with the Cabinet decision and
took the minister’s approval. An
officer signed the order on behalf of
the Union Government. This was
how O.M. No. 36012/ 31/90 was
born on 13 August 1990.
For the next few months, this was
the most hotly debated issue in the
country. Newspapers and magazines

WORKING

OF

INSTITUTIONS

were full of different views and
opinions on this issue. It led to
widespread protests and counterprotests, some of which were violent.
People reacted strongly because this
decision affected thousands of job
opportunities. Some felt that
existence of inequalities among
people of different castes in India
necessitated job reservations. They
felt, this would give a fair
opportunity to those communities
who so far had not adequately been
represented
in
government
employment.
Others felt that this was unfair as
it would deny equality of opportunity
to those who did not belong to
backward communities. They would
be denied jobs even though they
could be more qualified. Some felt
that this would perpetuate caste
feelings among people and hamper
national unity. In this chapter we
won’t discuss whether the decision
was good or not. We only take this
example to understand how major
decisions
are
taken
and
implemented in the country.
Who resolved this dispute? You
know that the Supreme Court and the
High Courts in India settle disputes
arising out of governmental decisions.
Some persons and associations
opposed to this order filed a number
of cases in the courts. They appealed
to the courts to declare the order
invalid and stop its implementation.
The Supreme Court of India bunched
all these cases together. This case was
known as the ‘Indira Sawhney and
others Vs Union of India case’. Eleven
judges of the Supreme Court heard
arguments of both sides. By a
majority, the Supreme Court judges
in 1992 declared that this order of the
Government of India was valid. At
the same time the Supreme Court
asked the government to modify its
59

2021-22

original order. It said that well-todo persons among the backward
classes should be excluded from
getting the benefit of reservation.
Accordingly, the Department of

Personnel and Training issued
another Office Memorandum on
8 September 1993. The dispute
thus came to an end and this policy
has been followed since then.

We have seen one example of how
the government works. Governing a
country involves various such
activities. For example, the
government is responsible for
ensuring security to the citizens and
providing facilities for education
and health to all. It collects taxes
and spends the money thus raised
on administration, defence and
development
programmes.
It
formulates and implements several
welfare schemes. Some persons have
to take decisions on how to go about
these activities. Others have to
implement these decisions. If
disputes arise on these decisions or
in their implementation, there should
be someone to determine what is
right and what is wrong. It is
important that everyone should
know who is responsible for doing
what. It is also important that these
activities keep taking place even if
the persons in key positions change.
So, to attend to all these tasks,
several arrangements are made in
all modern democracies. Such
arrangements are called institutions.
A democracy works well when these
institutions perform functions
assigned to them. The Constitution
of any country lays down basic
rules on the powers and functions

< The Civil Servants, working

< Supreme Court is an institution
where disputes between citizens
and the government are finally
settled.
Can you think of some other institutions in this example? What is
their role?
Working with institutions is not
easy. Institutions involve rules and
regulations. This can bind the hands
of leaders. Institutions involve
meetings, committees and routines.
This often leads to delays and
complications. Therefore dealing
with institutions can be frustrating.
One might feel that it is much better
to have one person take all decisions
without any rules, procedures and
meetings. But that is not the spirit
of democracy. Some of the delays
and complications introduced by
institutions are very useful. They
provide an opportunity for a wider
set of people to be consulted in any
decision. Institutions make it

In the example of the Office
Memorandum, do you remember
the role of Parliament? Perhaps not.
Since this decision was not taken
by Parliament, you might think that
Parliament had no role in it. But let
us go back to the story and see
whether Parliament figures in it. Let
us recall the points made earlier by
completing the following sentences:
< The
Report of the Mandal
Commission was discussed …
< The President of India mentioned
this in his …
< The Prime Minister made a …
The decision was not directly taken
in Parliament. But Parliamentary
discussions on the Report influenced
and shaped the decision of the
government. They brought pressure
on the government to act on the
Mandal
recommendation.
If
Parliament was not in favour of this
decision, the Government could not
have gone ahead with it. Can you
guess why? Recall what you read
about Parliament in the earlier

class and try to imagine what
Parliament could have done if it did
not approve of the Cabinet’s
decision.

In all democracies, an assembly of
elected representatives exercises
supreme political authority on
behalf of the people. In India such a
national assembly of elected
representatives is called Parliament.
At the state level this is called
Legislature or Legislative Assembly.
The name may vary in different
countries, but such an assembly
exists in every democracy. It
exercises political authority on
behalf of the people in many ways:
1 Parliament is the final authority for
making laws in any country. This
task of law making or legislation
is so crucial that these assemblies
are called legislatures. Parliaments
all over the world can make new
laws, change existing laws, or
abolish existing laws and make
new ones in their place.
2 Parliaments all over the world
exercise some control over those
who run the government. In some
countries like India this control is
direct and full. Those who run the
government can take decisions
only so long as they enjoy support
of Parliament.
3 Parliaments control all the money
that governments have. In most
countries the public money can
be spent only when Parliament
sanctions it.
61

4 Parliament is the highest forum of
discussion and debate on public
issues and national policy in any
country. Parliament can seek
information about any matter.

Tw o H
ouses of PPar
ar

Houses

liamentt
Since Parliament plays a central
role in modern democracies, most
large countries divide the role and
powers of Parliament in two parts.
They are called Chambers or
Houses. One House is usually
directly elected by the people and
exercises the real power on behalf
of the people. The second House is
usually elected indirectly and
performs some special functions.
The most common work for the
second House is to look after the
interests of various states, regions
or federal units.
In our country, Parliament
consists of two Houses. The two
Houses are known as the Council of
States (Rajya Sabha) and the House
of the People (Lok Sabha). The
President of India is a part of
Parliament, although she is not a
member of either House. That is why
all laws made in the Houses come
into force only after they receive the
assent of the President.
You have read about the Indian
Parliament in earlier classes. From
the Chapter 3 you know how Lok
Sabha elections take place. Let us
recall some key differences between
the composition of these two Houses
of Parliament. Answer the following
for the Lok Sabha and the Rajya
Sabha:
< What is the total number of
members? …
< Who elects the members? …
< What is the length of the term (in
years)? …
< Can the House be dissolved or is
it permanent? …

Which of the two Houses is more
powerful? It might appear that the
Rajya Sabha is more powerful, for
sometimes it is called the ‘Upper
Chamber’ and the Lok Sabha the
‘Lower Chamber’. But this does not
mean that Rajya Sabha is more
powerful than Lok Sabha. This is
just an old style of speaking and not
the language used in our
Constitution.
Our Constitution does give the
Rajya Sabha some special powers
over the states. But on most matters,
the Lok Sabha exercises supreme
power. Let us see how:
1 Any ordinary law needs to be
passed by both the Houses. But if
there is a difference between the
two Houses, the final decision is
taken in a joint session in which
members of both the Houses sit
together. Because of the larger
number of members, the view of
the Lok Sabha is likely to prevail
in such a meeting.
2 Lok Sabha exercises more powers
in money matters. Once the Lok
Sabha passes the budget of the
government or any other money
related law, the Rajya Sabha
cannot reject it. The Rajya Sabha
can only delay it by 14 days or
suggest changes in it. The Lok
Sabha may or may not accept
these changes.

A C T I V I T Y
When Parliament is in session, there is a special
programme everyday on Doordarshan about the
proceedings in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Watch
the proceedings or read about it in the newspapers
and note the following:
< Powers of the two Houses of Parliament.
< Role of the Speaker.
< Role of the Opposition.

What is the point in
having so much
debate and
discussion in the
Parliament when
we know that the
view of the ruling
party is going to
prevail?

3 Most importantly, the Lok Sabha
controls the Council of Ministers.
Only a person who enjoys the
support of the majority of the
members in the Lok Sabha is
appointed the Prime Minister. If the

majority of the Lok Sabha members
say they have ‘no confidence’ in the
Council of Ministers, all ministers
including the Prime Minister, have
to quit. The Rajya Sabha does not
have this power.

4.3 POLITICAL EXECUTIVE
Do you remember the story of the
Office Memorandum with which we
started this chapter? We found out
that the person who signed the
document did not take this
decision. He was only executing the
policy decision taken by someone
else. We noted the role of the Prime
Minister in taking that decision. But
we also know that he could not
have taken that decision if he did
not have support from the Lok Sabha.
In that sense he was only executing
the wishes of the Parliament.
Thus, at different levels of any
government we find functionaries
who take day-to-day decisions but
do not exercise supreme power on
behalf of the people. All those
functionaries are collectively known
as the executive. They are called
executive because they are in charge
of the ‘execution’ of the policies of
the government. Thus, when we talk
about ‘the government’ we usually
mean the executive.

Political and PPer
er

E x e c utiv
In a democratic country, two
categories make up the executive.
One that is elected by the people for
a specific period, is called the
political executive. Political leaders
who take the big decisions fall in this
category. In the second category,
people are appointed on a long-term
basis. This is called the permanent
executive or civil services. Persons
working in civil services are called
civil servants. They remain in office
even when the ruling party changes.
These officers work under political
executive and assist them in
carrying out the day-to-day
administration. Can you recall the
role of political and non-political

executive in the case of the Office
Memorandum?
You might ask: Why does the
political executive have more power
than the non-political executive?
Why is the minister more powerful
than the civil servant? The civil
servant is usually more educated
and has more expert knowledge of
the subject. The advisors working in
the Finance Ministry know more
about economics than the Finance
Minister. Sometimes the ministers
may know very little about the
technical matters that come under
their ministry. This could easily
happen in ministries like Defence,
Industry, Health, Science and
Technology, Mines, etc. Why should
the minister have the final say on
these matters?
The reason is very simple. In a
democracy the will of the people is
supreme. The minister is an elected
representative of the people and
thus empowered to exercise the will
of the people on their behalf. She is
finally answerable to the people for
all the consequences of her
decision. That is why the minister
takes all the final decisions. The
minister decides the overall
framework and objectives in which
decisions on policy should be
made. The minister is not, and is not
expected to be, an expert in the
matters of her ministry. The
minister takes the advice of experts
on all technical matters. But very
often experts hold different opinions
or place before her more than one
option. Depending on what the
overall objective is, the minister
decides.
Actually this happens in any large
organisation. Those who understand
the overall picture take the most

important decisions, not the
experts. The experts can tell the
route, but someone with a larger
view decides the destination. In a
democracy elected ministers
perform this role.

The race to become
minister is not new.
Here is a cartoon
depicting ministerial
aspirants waiting to
get a berth in Nehru’s
Cabinet after the
1962 elections. Why
do you think political
leaders are so keen to
become ministers?

Prime Minister is the most
important political institution in the
country. Yet there is no direct
election to the post of the Prime
Minister. The President appoints the
Prime Minister. But the President
cannot appoint anyone she likes.
The President appoints the leader
of the majority party or the coalition
of parties that commands a majority
in the Lok Sabha, as Prime Minister.
In case no single party or alliance
gets a majority, the President
appoints the person most likely to
secure a majority support. The
Prime Minister does not have a fixed
tenure. He continues in power so
long as he remains the leader of the
majority party or coalition.

WORKING

OF

INSTITUTIONS

After the appointment of the Prime
Minister, the President appoints
other ministers on the advice of the
Prime Minister. The Ministers are
usually from the party or the
coalition that has the majority in the
Lok Sabha. The Prime Minister is
free to choose ministers, as long as
they are members of Parliament.
Sometimes, a person who is not a
member of Parliament can also
become a minister. But such a
person has to get elected to one of
the Houses of Parliament within six
months of appointment as minister.
Council of Ministers is the official
name for the body that includes all
the Ministers. It usually has 60 to
80 Ministers of different ranks.
< Cabinet Ministers are usually toplevel leaders of the ruling party or
parties who are in charge of the
major ministries. Usually the
Cabinet Ministers meet to take
decisions in the name of the
Council of Ministers. Cabinet is
thus the inner ring of the Council
of Ministers. It comprises about 25
ministers.
< Ministers of State with independent charge are usually in-charge
of smaller Ministries. They
participate in the Cabinet meetings only when specially invited.
< Ministers of State are attached to
and required to assist Cabinet
Ministers.
Since it is not practical for all
ministers to meet regularly and
discuss everything, the decisions are
taken in Cabinet meetings. That is
why parliamentary democracy in
most countries is often known as the
Cabinet form of government. The
Cabinet works as a team. The
ministers may have different views
and opinions, but everyone has to own
up to every decision of the Cabinet.

The Constitution does not say very
much about the powers of the Prime
Minister or the ministers or their
relationship with each other. But as
head of the government, the Prime
Minister has wide ranging powers.
He chairs Cabinet meetings. He
coordinates the work of different
Departments. His decisions are final
in case disagreements arise between
Departments. He exercises general
supervision of different ministries.
All ministers work under his
leadership. The Prime Minister
distributes and redistributes work
to the ministers. He also has the
power to dismiss ministers. When
the Prime Minister quits, the entire
ministry quits.
Thus, if the Cabinet is the most
powerful institution in India, within
the Cabinet it is the Prime Minister

No minister can openly criticise
any decision of the government,
even if it is about another Ministry
or Department. Every ministry has
secretaries, who are civil servants.
The secretaries provide the
necessary background information
to the ministers to take decisions.

who is the most powerful. The
powers of the Prime Minister in all
parliamentary democracies of the
world have increased so much in
recent decades that parliamentary
democracies are some times seen as

form
of
government. As political parties have
come to play a major role in politics,
the Prime Minister controls the
Cabinet and Parliament through the
party. The media also contributes to
this trend by making politics and
elections as a competition between
top leaders of parties. In India too
we have seen such a tendency
towards the concentration of powers
in the hands of the Prime Minister.
Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime
Minister of India, exercised
enormous authority because he had
great influence over the public.
Indira Gandhi was also a very
powerful leader compared to her
colleagues in the Cabinet. Of course,
the extent of power wielded by a
Prime Minister also depends on the
personality of the person holding
that position.
However, in recent years the rise
of coalition politics has imposed
certain constraints on the power of
the Prime Minister. The Prime

The

President

While the Prime Minister is the head
of the government, the President is
the head of the State. In our political
system the head of the State exercises
only nominal powers. The President of
India is like the Queen of Britain whose
functions are to a large extent
ceremonial. The President supervises
the overall functioning of all the political
institutions in the country so that they
operate in harmony to achieve the
objectives of the State.
Press Information Bureau

Did you protest
when the book
referred to the
Prime Minister as
‘he’? Have we not
had a woman
Prime Minister?
Why should we
assume that all the
important positions
are held by men?

The President is not elected directly
by the people. The elected Members
of Parliament (MPs) and the elected
Members of the Legislative
Assemblies (MLAs) elect her. A
candidate standing for President’s
post has to get a majority of votes to
win the election. This ensures that
the President can be seen to represent
the entire nation. At the same time
the President can never claim the kind
of direct popular mandate that the
Prime Minister can. This ensures that
she remains only a nominal executive.
The same is true of the powers of
the President. If you casually read
the Constitution you would think
that there is nothing that she cannot
do. All governmental activities take
place in the name of the President.
All laws and major policy decisions
of the government are issued in her
name. All major appointments are
made in the name of the President.
These include the appointment of

the Chief Justice of India, the
Judges of the Supreme Court and
the High Courts of the states, the
Governors of the states, the Election
Commissioners, ambassadors to
other countries, etc. All international
treaties and agreements are made in
the name of the President. The
President
is
the
supreme
commander of the defence forces of
India.
But we should remember that the
President exercises all these powers
only on the advice of the Council of
Ministers. The President can ask the
Council of Ministers to reconsider its
advice. But if the same advice is
given again, she is bound to act
according to it. Similarly, a bill
passed by the Parliament becomes
a law only after the President gives
assent to it. If the President wants,
she can delay this for some time and
send the bill back to Parliament for
reconsideration. But if Parliament
passes the bill again, she has to
sign it.
So you may wonder what does the
President really do? Can she do
anything on her own at all? There is
one very important thing she should
do on her own: appoint the Prime
Minister. When a party or coalition
of parties secures a clear majority
in the elections, the President, has
to appoint the leader of the majority
party or the coalition that enjoys
majority support in the Lok Sabha.

When no party or coalition gets a
majority in the Lok Sabha, the
President exercises her discretion.
The President appoints a leader who
in her opinion can muster majority
support in the Lok Sabha. In such a
case, the President can ask the
newly appointed Prime Minister to
prove majority support in the Lok
Sabha within a specified time.

The Presidential System
Presidents all over the world are not always nominal executives like the President of India. In many
countries of the world, the President is both the
head of the state and the head of the government.
The President of the United States of America is
the most well known example of this kind of President. The US President is directly elected by the
people. He personally chooses and appoints all
Ministers. The law making is still done by the legislature (called the Congress in the US), but the
president can veto any law. Most importantly, the
president does not need the support of the majority of members in the Congress and neither is he
answerable to them. He has a fixed tenure of four
years and completes it even if his party does not
have a majority in the Congress.
This model is followed in most of the countries
of Latin America and many of the ex-Soviet Union
countries. Given the centrality of the President,
this system of government is called the Presidential form of government. In countries like ours that
follow the British model, the parliament is supreme. Therefore our system is called the parliamentary system of government.

Eliamma, Annakutti and Marymol read the section on the President. Each of them had a question. Can
you help them in answering these questions?
Eliamma: What happens if the President and the Prime Minister disagree about some policy? Does the
view of the Prime Minister always prevail?
Annakutti: I find it funny that the President is the Supreme Commander of Armed Forces. I doubt if the
President can even lift a heavy gun. What is the point in making the President the Commander?
Marymol: I would say, what is the point in having a President at all if all the real powers are with the
Prime Minister?

4.4 THE JUDICIARY
Let us return, one final time, to the
story of Office Memorandum that we
started with. This time let us not
recall the story, but imagine how
different the story could have been.
Remember, the story came to a
satisfactory end because the
Supreme Court gave a verdict that
was accepted by everyone. Imagine
what would have happened in the
following situations:
< If there was nothing like a
Supreme Court in the country.
< Even if there was a Supreme
Court, if it had no power to judge
actions of the government.
< Even if it had the power, if no one
trusted the Supreme Court to give
a fair verdict.
< Even if it gave a fair judgement, if
those who appealed against the
Government Order did not accept
the judgement.

It is quite common in
the US for judges to
be nominated on the
basis of well-known
political opinions and
affiliations. This
fictitious
advertisement
appeared in the US in
2005 when President
Bush was considering
various candidates for
nomination to the US
supreme court. What
does this cartoon say
about the
independence of the
judiciary? Why do
such cartoons not
appear in our
country? Does this
demonstrate the
independence of our
judiciary?

A C T I V I T Y
Follow the news about any major court case in a
High Court or the Supreme Court. What was the
original verdict? Did the High Court or the
Supreme Court change it? What was the reason?

This is why an independent and
powerful judiciary is considered
essential for democracies. All the
courts at different levels in a country
put together are called the judiciary.
The Indian judiciary consists of a
Supreme Court for the entire nation,
High Courts in the states, District
Courts and the courts at local level.
India has an integrated judiciary. It
means the Supreme Court controls
the judicial administration in the
country. Its decisions are binding on
all other courts of the country. It can
take up any dispute
< Between citizens of the country;
< Between citizens and government;
< Between two or more state
governments; and
< Between governments at the union
and state level.
It is the highest court of appeal in
civil and criminal cases. It can hear
appeals against the decisions of the
High Courts.
Independence of the judiciary
means that it is not under the
control of the legislature or the
executive. The judges do not act on
the direction of the government or
according to the wishes of the party
in power. That is why all modern
democracies have courts that are
independent of the legislature and
the executive. India has achieved
this. The judges of the Supreme
Court and the High Courts are
appointed by the President on the
advice of the Prime Minister and in
69

2021-22

consultation with the Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court. In practice it
now means that the senior judges
of the Supreme Court select the new
judges of the Supreme Court and the
High Courts. There is very little scope
for interference by the political
executive. The senior most judge of
the Supreme Court is usually
appointed the Chief Justice. Once
a person is appointed as judge of the
Supreme Court or the High Court it
is nearly impossible to remove him
or her from that position. It is as
difficult as removing the President
of India. A judge can be removed
only by an impeachment motion
passed separately by two-thirds
members of the two Houses of the
Parliament. It has never happened
in the history of Indian democracy.
The judiciary in India is also one
of the most powerful in the world.
The Supreme Court and the High
Courts have the power to interpret
the Constitution of the country. They
can declare invalid any law of the
legislature or the actions of the
executive, whether at the Union
level or at the state level, if they find
such a law or action is against the

Constitution. Thus they can
determine the Constitutional
validity of any legislation or action
of the executive in the country,
when it is challenged before them.
This is known as the judicial review.
The Supreme Court of India has also
ruled that the core or basic
principles of the Constitution cannot
be changed by the Parliament.
The powers and the independence
of the Indian judiciary allow it to act
as the guardian of the Fundamental
Rights. We shall see in the next
chapter that the citizens have a
right to approach the courts to seek
remedy in case of any violation of
their rights. In recent years the
Courts have given several
judgments and directives to protect
public interest and human rights.
Any one can approach the courts if
public interest is hurt by the actions
of government. This is called public
interest litigation. The courts
intervene to prevent the misuse of
the government’s power to make
decisions. They check malpractices
on the part of public officials. That is
why the judiciary enjoys a high level
of confidence among the people.

Give one reason each to argue that Indian judiciary is independent with respect to:
Appointment of judges: …
Removal of judges: …
Powers of the judiciary: …

Why are people
allowed to go to
courts against the
government’s
decisions?

A teacher was making preparations for a mock parliament. She called
two students to act as leaders of two political parties. She gave them
an option: Each one could choose to have a majority either in the
mock Lok Sabha or in the mock Rajya Sabha. If this choice was given
to you, which one would you choose and why?

After reading the example of the reservation order, three students
had different reactions about the role of the judiciary. Which view,
according to you, is a correct reading of the role of judiciary?
a Srinivas argues that since the Supreme Court agreed with the
government, it is not independent.
b Anjaiah says that judiciary is independent because it could have
given a verdict against the government order. The Supreme Court
did direct the government to modify it.
c Vijaya thinks that the judiciary is neither independent nor
conformist, but acts as a mediator between opposing parties. The
court struck a good balance between those who supported and
those who opposed the order.
