CHAPTER 5

DEMOCRATIC
RIGHTS

OVERVIEW
In the previous two chapters we have looked at two major elements of a
democratic government. In Chapter 3 we saw how a democratic
government has to be periodically elected by the people in a free and fair
manner. In Chapter 4 we learnt that a democracy must be based on
institutions that follow certain rules and procedures. These elements are
necessary but not sufficient for a democracy. Elections and institutions
need to be combined with a third element – enjoyment of rights – to make
a government democratic. Even the most properly elected rulers working
through the established institutional process must learn not to cross some
limits. Citizens’ democratic rights set those limits in a democracy.
This is what we take up in this final chapter of the book. We begin by
discussing some real life cases to imagine what it means to live without
rights. This leads to a discussion on what we mean by rights and why do
we need them. As in the previous chapters, the general discussion is
followed by a focus on India. We discuss one by one the Fundamental
Rights in the Indian Constitution. Then we turn to how these rights can
be used by ordinary citizens. Who will protect and enforce them? Finally
we take a look at how the scope of rights has been expanding.

Dear Mr Tony Blair,
Firstly, how are you? I sent a
letter two years ago, why didn’t
you reply?!? I was waiting for a
long time but you did not reply.
Please can you give me an answer
to my question? Why is my dad in
prison? Why is he far away in
that Guantánamo Bay?! I miss my
dad so much. I have not seen my
dad for three years. I know my
dad has not done anything,
because he is a good man. I hear
everybody speak about my dad in
a nice way. Your children spend
Christmas with you, but me and
my brothers, and sisters have
spent Eid alone without our dad
for 3 years. What do you think
about that?
I hope you will answer me this

examples of what it means to live in
the absence of rights.

P r ison in GGuan

About 600 people were secretly
picked up by the US forces from all
over the world and put in a prison
in Guantanamo Bay, an area near
Cuba controlled by Amercian Navy.
Anas’s father, Jamil El-Banna, was
among them. The American
government said that they were
enemies of the US and linked to the
attack on New York on 11
September 2001. In most cases the
governments of their countries were
not asked or even informed about
their imprisonment. Like other
prisoners, El-Banna’s family got to
know that he was in that prison only
through the media. Families of
prisoners, media or even UN
representatives were not allowed to
meet them. The US army arrested
them, interrogated them and
decided whether to keep them there
or not. There was no trial before any
magistrate in the US. Nor could
these prisoners approach courts in
their own country.
Amnesty International, an
international human rights
organisation, collected information
on the condition of the prisoners in
Guantanamo Bay and reported that
the prisoners were being tortured in
ways that violated the US laws. They

75

2021-22

were being denied the treatment
that even prisoners of war must get
as per international treaties. Many
prisoners had tried protesting against
these conditions by going on a hunger
strike. Prisoners were not released
even after they were officially declared
not guilty. An independent inquiry
by the UN supported these findings.
The UN Secretary General said the
prison in Guantanamo Bay should be
closed down. The US government
refused to accept these pleas.

The case of Guantanamo Bay looks
like an exception, for it involves the
government of one country denying
rights to citizens of another country.
Let us therefore look at the case of
Saudi Arabia and the position of the
citizens with regard to their
government. Consider these facts:
< The country is ruled by a
hereditary king and the people
have no role in electing or
changing their rulers.
< The king selects the legislature as
well as the executive. He appoints
the judges and can change any of
their decisions.
< Citizens cannot form political parties or any political organisations.
Media cannot report anything that
the monarch does not like.
< There is no freedom of religion.
Every citizen is required to be
Muslim. Non-Muslim residents
can follow their religion in private,
but not in public.
< Women are subjected to many
public restrictions. The testimony
of one man is considered equal to
that of two women.
This is true not just of Saudi
Arabia. There are many countries in
the world where several of these
conditions exist.

You might think that this is possible
in an absolute monarchy but not
in countries which choose their
rulers. Just consider this story from
Kosovo. This was a province of
Yugoslavia before its split. In this
province the population was
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian.
But in the entire country, Serbs
were in majority. A narrow minded
Serb
nationalist
Milosevic
(pronounced Miloshevich) had won
the election. His government was
very hostile to the Kosovo
Albanians. He wanted the Serbs to
dominate the country. Many Serb
leaders thought that Ethnic
minorities like Albanians should
either leave the country or accept
the dominance of the Serbs.
This is what happened to an
Albanian family in a town in Kosovo
in April 1999:
“74-year-old Batisha Hoxha was
sitting in her kitchen with her 77year–old husband, Izet, staying
warm by the stove. They had heard
explosions but did not realise that
Serbian troops had already entered
the town. The next thing she knew,
five or six soldiers had burst through
the front door and were demanding
“Where are your children?”
“… they shot Izet three times in the
chest” recalled Batisha. With her
husband dying before her, the
soldiers pulled the wedding ring off
her finger and told her to get out. “I
was not even outside the gate when they
burned the house” … She was standing

on the street in the rain with no
house, no husband, no possessions
but the clothes she was wearing.”
This news report was typical of
what happened to thousands of
Albanians in that period. Do

If you were a Serb,
would you support
what Milosevic did
in Kosovo? Do you
think his project of
establishing Serb
dominance was
good for the
Serbs?

remember that this massacre was
being carried out by the army of
their own country, working under
the direction of a leader who came
to power through democratic
elections. This was one of the worst
instances of killings based on ethnic
prejudices in recent times. Finally
several other countries intervened
to stop this massacre. Milosevic lost
power and was tried by the
International Court of Justice for
crimes against humanity.

5.2 RIGHTS

IN A DEMOCRACY

Think of all the examples that we
have discussed so far. Think of the
victims in each example: the
prisoners in Guantanamo Bay,
women in Saudi Arabia, Albanians
in Kosovo. If you were in their
position, what would you have
wished? If you could, what would
you do to ensure that such things
do not happen to anyone?
You would perhaps desire a
system where security, dignity and
fair play are assured to everyone.
You might want, for example, that
no one should be arrested without
proper reason and information. And
if someone is arrested, he or she
should have a fair chance to defend
themselves. You might agree that
such assurance cannot apply to
DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS

everything. One has to be reasonable
in what one expects and demands of
everyone else, for one has to grant
the same to everyone. But you might
insist that the assurance does not
remain on paper, that there is
someone
to
enforce
these
assurances, that those who violate
these are punished. In other words,
you might want a system where at
least a minimum is guaranteed to
everyone – powerful or weak, rich
or poor, majority or minority. This
is the spirit behind thinking about
rights.

What are rights?
Rights are claims of a person over
other fellow beings, over the society
and over the government. All of us
77

2021-22

want to live happily, without fear
and without being subjected to
degraded treatment. For this we
expect others to behave in such a
way that does not harm us or hurt
us. Equally, our actions should not
also harm or hurt others. So a right
is possible when you make a claim
that is equally possible for others.
You cannot have a right that harms
or hurts others. You cannot have a
right to play a game in such a way
that it breaks the neighbour’s
window. The Serbs in Yugoslavia
could not have claimed the whole
country for themselves. The claims
we make should be reasonable.
They should be such that can be
made available to others in an equal
measure. Thus, a right comes with
an obligation to respect other rights.
Just because we claim some thing
it does not become our right. It has
to be recognised by the society we
live in. Rights acquire meaning only
in society. Every society makes
certain rules to regulate our
conduct. They tell us what is right
and what is wrong. What is
recognised by the society as rightful
becomes the basis of rights. That is
why the notion of rights changes
from time to time and society to
society. Two hundred years ago
anyone who said that women should
have right to vote would have
sounded strange. Today not granting
them vote in Saudi Arabia appears
strange.
When the socially recognised
claims are written into law they
acquire real force. Otherwise they
remain merely as natural or moral
rights.
The
prisoners
in
Guantanamo Bay had a moral claim
not to be tortured or humiliated. But
they could not go to anyone to
enforce this claim. When law
recognises some claims they become

enforceable. We can then demand
their application. When fellow
citizens or the government do not
respect these rights we call it
violation or infringement of our
rights. In such circumstances
citizens can approach courts to
protect their rights. So, if we want
to call any claim a right, it has to
have these three qualities. Rights
are reasonable claims of persons
recognised by society and
sanctioned by law.

Rights are necessary for the very
sustenance of a democracy. In a
democracy every citizen has to have
the right to vote and the right to
be elected to government. For
democratic elections to take place, it
is necessary that citizens should
have the right to express their
opinion, form political parties and
take part in political activities.
Rights also perform a very special
role in a democracy. Rights protect
minorities from the oppression of
majority. They ensure that the
majority cannot do whatever it likes.
Rights are guarantees which can be
used when things go wrong. Things
may go wrong when some citizens
may wish to take away the rights of
others. This usually happens when
those in majority want to dominate
those in minority. The government
should protect the citizens’ rights in
such a situation. But sometimes
elected governments may not
protect or may even attack the rights
of their own citizens. That is why
some rights need to be placed higher
than the government, so that the
government cannot violate them. In
most democracies the basic rights
of the citizen are written down in the
constitution.

5.3 RIGHTS

Everyone knows
that the rich can

is the point in
talking about
equality before
law?

IN THE

INDIAN CONSTITUTION

In India, like most other
democracies in the world, these
rights are mentioned in the
Constitution. Some rights which are
fundamental to our life are given a
special status. They are called
Fundamental Rights. We have
already read in Chapter 2 the
preamble to our Constitution. It
talks about securing for all its
citizens equality, liberty and justice.
Fundamental Rights put this
promise into effect. They are an
important basic feature of India’s
Constitution.
You already know our Constitution
provides for six Fundamental Rights.
Can you recall these? What exactly
do these rights mean for an ordinary
citizen? Let us look at these one by
one.

R igh
qualit
ightt ttoo EEqualit
qualityy
The Constitution says that the
government shall not deny to any
person in India equality before the law
or the equal protection of the laws. It
means that the laws apply in the same
manner to all, regardless of a person’s
status. This is called the rule of law.
Rule of law is the foundation of any
democracy. It means that no person
is above the law. There cannot be any
distinction between a political leader,
government official and an ordinary
citizen.
Every citizen, from the Prime
Minister to a small farmer in a remote
village, is subjected to the same laws.
No person can legally claim any
special treatment or privilege just
because he or she happens to be an
important person. For example, a few
years ago a former Prime Minister of
the country faced a court case on
charges of cheating. The court finally
declared that he was not guilty. But
as long as the case continued, he had
to go to the court, give evidence and
file papers, just like any other citizen.
This basic position is further
clarified in the Constitution by
spelling out some implications of the
Right to Equality. The government
shall not discriminate against any
citizen on grounds only of religion,
race, caste, sex or place of birth. Every
citizen shall have access to public
places like shops, restaurants, hotels,
and cinema halls. Similarly, there
shall be no restriction with regard to
the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats,
roads, playgrounds and places of
public resorts maintained by
government or dedicated to the use
of general public. This might appear
very obvious, but it was necessary to

incorporate these rights in the
Constitution of our country where the
traditional caste system did not allow
people from some communities to
access all public places.
The same principle applies to
public jobs. All citizens have equality
of opportunity in matters relating to
employment or appointment to any
position in the government. No
citizen shall be discriminated
against or made ineligible for
employment on the grounds
mentioned above. You have read in
Chapter 4 that the Government of
India has provided reservations for
Scheduled Castes, Scheduled
Tribes and Other Backward Classes.
Various governments have different
schemes for giving preference to
women, poor or physically
handicapped in some kinds of jobs.
Are these reservations against the
right to equality? They are not. For
equality does not mean giving
everyone the same treatment, no
matter what they need. Equality
means giving everyone an equal
opportunity to achieve whatever one
is capable of. Sometimes it is
necessary to give special treatment
to someone in order to ensure equal
opportunity. This is what job
reservations do. Just to clarify this,
the Constitution says that
reservations of this kind are not a
violation of the Right to Equality.
The principle of non-discrimination
extends to social life as well. The
Constitution mentions one extreme
form of social discrimination, the
practice of untouchability, and
clearly directs the government to put
an end to it. The practice of
untouchability has been forbidden
in any form. Untouchability here
does not only mean refusal to touch
people belonging to certain castes.
It refers to any belief or social

practice which looks down upon
people on account of their birth with
certain caste labels. Such practice
denies them interaction with others
or access to public places as equal
citizens. So the Constitution made
untouchability a punishable offence.

In 1999, P. Sainath wrote a series of newsreports
in The Hindu describing untouchability and caste
discrimination that was still being practiced
against Dalits or persons belonging to Scheduled
Castes. He travelled to various parts of the country and found that in many places:
< Tea stalls kept two kinds of cups, one for Dalits
one for others;
< Barbers refused to serve dalit clients;
< Dalit students were made to sit separately in the
classroom or drink water from separate picher;
< Dalit grooms were not allowed to ride a horse
in the wedding procession; and
< Dalits were not allowed to use common
handpump or if they did, the handpump was
washed to purify it.
All these fall under the definition of untouchability.
Can you think of some examples from your own
area?

Should the
freedom of
expression be
extended to those
who are spreading
wrong and narrowminded ideas?
Should they be
allowed to confuse
the public?

Freedom means absence of
constraints. In practical life it means
absence of interference in our affairs
by others – be it other individuals
or the government. We want to live
in society, but we want to be free.
We want to do things in the way we
want to do them. Others should not
dictate us what we should do. So,
under the Indian Constitution all
citizens have the right to
< Freedom of speech and expression
< Assembly in a peaceful manner
< Form associations and unions
< Move freely throughout the
country
< Reside in any part of the country,
and
< Practice any profession, or to carry
on any occupation, trade or
business.
You should remember that every
citizen has the right to all these
freedoms. That means you cannot
exercise your freedom in such a
DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS

manner that violates others’ right to
freedom. Your freedoms should not
cause public nuisance or disorder.
You are free to do everything which
injures no one else. Freedom is not
unlimited licence to do what one
wants. Accordingly, the government
can impose certain reasonable
restrictions on our freedoms in the
larger interests of the society.
Freedom of speech and
expression is one of the essential
features of any democracy. Our ideas
and personality develop only when we
are able to freely communicate with
others. You may think differently
from others. Even if a hundred
people think in one way, you should
have the freedom to think differently
and express your views accordingly.
You may disagree with a policy of
government or activities of an
association. You are free to criticise
the government or the activities of
the
association
in
your
conversations with parents, friends
and relatives. You may publicise
your views through a pamphlet,
magazine or newspaper. You can do
it through paintings, poetry or
songs. However, you cannot use this
freedom to instigate violence against
others. You cannot use it to incite
people to rebel against government.

procedure established by law. It
means that no person can be killed
unless the court has ordered a death
sentence. It also means that a
government or police officer cannot
arrest or detain any citizen unless
he has proper legal justification.
Even when they do, they have to
follow some procedures:
< A person who is arrested and
detained in custody will have to be
informed of the reasons for such
arrest and detention.
< A person who is arrested and
detained shall be produced before
the nearest magistrate within a
period of 24 hours of arrest.
< Such a person has the right to
consult a lawyer or engage a
lawyer for his defence.

Neither can you use it to defame
others by saying false and mean
things that cause damage to a
person’s reputation.
Citizens have the freedom to
hold meetings, processions, rallies
and demonstrations on any issue.
They may want to discuss a
problem, exchange ideas, mobilise
public support to a cause, or seek
votes for a candidate or party in an
election. But such meetings have to
be peaceful. They should not lead
to public disorder or breach of peace
in society. Those who participate in
these activities and meetings should
not carry weapons with them.
Citizens also can form associations.
For example workers in a factory can
form a workers’ union to promote
their interests. Some people in a
town may come together to form an
association to campaign against
corruption or pollution.
As citizens we have the freedom to
travel to any part of the country.
We are free to reside and settle in any
party of the territory of India. Let us
say a person who belongs to the state
of Assam wants to start a business
in Hyderabad. He may not have any
connection with that city, he may not
have even seen it ever. Yet as a citizen
of India he has the right to set up base
there. This right allows lakhs of
people to migrate from villages to
towns and from poorer regions of the
countries to prosperous regions and
big cities. The same freedom extends
to choice of occupations. No one can
force you to do or not to do a certain
job. Women cannot be told that some
kinds of occupations are not for them.
People from deprived castes cannot
be kept to their traditional
occupations.
The Constitution says that no
person can be deprived of his life or
personal liberty except according to

threat to the most basic of all
liberties, the protection of
individual life and personal liberty.

Once the right to liberty and equality
is granted, it follows that every
citizen has a right not to be
exploited. Yet the Constitution
makers thought is was necessary to
write down certain clear provisions
to prevent exploitation of the weaker
sections of the society.
The Constitution mentions three
specific evils and declares these
illegal. First, the Constitution
prohibits ‘traffic in human beings’.
Traffic here means selling and
buying of human beings, usually
women, for immoral purposes.
Second, our Constitution also
prohibits forced labour or begar in

any form. Begar is a practice where
the worker is forced to render service
to the ‘master’ free of charge or at a
nominal remuneration. When this
practice takes place on a life-long
basis, it is called the practice of
bonded labour.
Finally, the Constitution also
prohibits child labour. No one can
employ a child below the age of
fourteen to work in any factory or
mine or in any other hazardous
work, such as railways and ports.
Using this as a basis many laws have
been made to prohibit children from
working in industries such as beedi
making, firecrackers and matches,
printing and dyeing.

On the basis of these news reports write a letter to the editor or a petition to a court highlighting the
violation of right against exploitation:

A petition was filed in the
Madras High Court. The
petitioner said a large number
of children aged between
seven and 12 were taken from
villages in Salem district and
sold at auctions at Olur Nagar
in Kerala’s Thrissur district.
The petitioner requested the
courts to order the government
to check these facts.
(March 2005)

Children, from the age of five,
were employed in the iron ore
mines in the Hospet, Sandur and
the Ikal areas in Karnataka.
Children were forced to carry out
digging, breaking stones, loading,
dumping, transporting and
processing of iron ore with no
safety equipment, fixed wages and
working hours. They handled a
high-level of toxic wastes and
were exposed to mine dust, which
was above the permissible level.
The school dropout rate in the
region was very high. (May 2005)

Right to freedom includes right to
freedom of religion as well. In this case
too, the Constitution makers were
very particular to state it clearly. You
have already read in Chapter 2 that
India is a secular state. Most people
in India, like anywhere else in the
world, follow different religions. Some
may not believe in any religion.
Secularism is based on the idea that
the state is concerned only with
relations among human beings, and
not with the relation between human
beings and God. A secular state is one
that does not establish any one
religion as official religion. Indian
secularism practices an attitude of a
principled and equal distance from
all religions. The state has to be
neutral and impartial in dealing with
all religions.
Every person has a right to
profess, practice and propagate
the religion he or she believes in.
Every religious group or sect is free
to manage its religious affairs. A
right to propagate one’s religion,
however, does not mean that a
person has right to compel another
person to convert into his religion by
means of force, fraud, inducement or
allurement. Of course, a person is free
to change religion on his or her own
will. Freedom to practice religion
does not mean that a person can do
whatever he wants in the name of

religion. For example, one cannot
sacrifice animals or human beings
as offerings to supernatural forces
or gods. Religious practices which
treat women as inferior or those that
infringe women’s freedom are not
allowed. For example, one cannot
force a widow to shave head or wear
white clothes.
A secular state is one that does not
confer any privilege or favour on any
particular religion. Nor does it punish or discriminate against people
on the basis of religion they follow.
Thus the government cannot compel any person to pay any taxes for
the promotion or maintenance of
any particular religion or religious
institution. There shall be no
religious instruction in the government educational institutions. In
educational institutions managed by
private bodies no person shall be
compelled to take part in any
religious instruction or to attend any
religious worship.

You might wonder why the
Constitution makers were so
particular in providing written
guarantees of the rights of the
minorities. Why are there no special
guarantees for the majority? Well, for
the simple reason that the working
of democracy gives power to the
majority. It is the language, culture
and religion of minorities that needs
special protection. Otherwise, they
may get neglected or undermined
under the impact of the language,
religion and culture of the majority.
That is why the Constitution specifies the cultural and educational
rights of the minorities:
< Any section of citizens with a
distinct language or culture have
a right to conserve it.

The Constitution
does not give
people their
religion. Then how
can it give people
the right to practise
their religion?

< Admission

to any educational
institution
maintained
by
government
or
receiving
government aid cannot be denied
to any citizen on the ground of
religion or language.
< All minorities have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.
Here minority does not mean only
religious minority at the national

level. In some places people speaking
a particular language are in majority;
people speaking a different language
are in a minority. For example,
Telugu speaking people form a
majority in Andhra Pradesh. But they
are a minority in the neighbouring
State of Karnataka. Sikhs constitute
a majority in Punjab. But they are a
minority in Rajasthan, Haryana and
Delhi.

proposal to form a separate body to manage the affairs of Sikh shrines in Haryana. It warned the
government that the Sikh community would not tolerate any interference in their religious affairs.

Rajasthan Government has decided to enact an anti-conversion law. Christian leaders have said
that the Bill would aggravate the sense of insecurity and fear in the minds of minorities. (March 2005)

How can we secure
these rights?

Can the President
of India stop you
from approaching
the Supreme Court
to secure your
fundamental
rights?

If rights are like guarantees, they are
of no use if there is no one to honour
them. The fundamental rights in the
Constitution are important because
they are enforceable. We have a right
to seek the enforcement of the above
mentioned rights. This is called the
Right to Constitutional Remedies.
This itself is a Fundamental Right.
This right makes other rights
effective. It is possible that
sometimes our rights may be
violated by fellow citizens, private
bodies or by the government. When
any of our rights are violated we can
seek remedy through courts. If it is a
Fundamental Right we can directly
approach the Supreme Court or the
High Court of a state. That is why Dr.
Ambedkar called the Right to
Constitutional Remedies, ‘the heart
and soul’ of our Constitution.
DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS

Fundamental

are

any other authorities instituted by

or action that violates the
Fundamental Rights. If any act of the

away or limits any of the
Fundamental Rights it will be
invalid. We can challenge such laws
of
the
central
and
state
governments, the policies and
actions of the government or the
governmental organisations like the
nationalised banks or electricity
boards. Courts also enforce the
Fundamental Rights against private

Supreme Court and High Courts
have the power to issue directions,
orders or writs for the enforcement
of the Fundamental Rights. They can
also award compensation to the

National Human Rights Commission
Do you notice references to the National Human
Rights Commission (NHRC) in the news collage
on this page? These references reflect the growing
awareness of human rights and struggles for human
dignity. Many cases of human rights violations in
diverse fields, for instance, Gujarat riots, are being
brought to the public notice from across India.
Human rights organisations and the media often
criticise government agencies for not seriously
pursuing these cases or catching the culprits.
Someone had to intervene on behalf of the
victims. This is where the National Human Rights
Commission stepped in. This is an independent
commission set up by law in 1993. Like
judiciary, the Commission is independent of the
government. The Commission is appointed by the
President and includes retired judges, officers and
eminent citizens. Yet it does not have the burden of
deciding court cases. So it can focus on helping
the victims secure their human rights. These
include all the rights granted to the citizens by the
Constitution. For NHRC human rights also include
the rights mentioned in the UN sponsored
international treaties that India has signed.

The NHRC cannot by itself punish the guilty.
That is the responsibility of courts. The NHRC is
there to make independent and credible inquiry
into any case of violation of human rights. It also
inquires into any case of abetment of such
violation or negligence in controlling it by any
government officer and takes other general steps
to promote human rights in the country. The
Commission presents its findings and
recommendations to the government or intervene
in the court on behalf of the victims. It has wide
ranging powers to carry out its inquiry. Like any
court it can summon witnesses, question any
government official, demand any official paper,
visit any prison for inspection or send its own
team for on-the-spot inquiry.
Any citizen of India can write a letter to this
address to complain against the violation of
human rights: National Human Rights
Commission, G.P.O. Complex, INA, New Delhi
110023. There is no fee or anyformal procedure
to approach the NHRC. Like NHRC, there are
State Human RightsCommissions in 26 states
of the country (as on 10 December 2018). For

violators. We have already seen in
Chapter 4 that the judiciary in our
country is independent of the
government and the parliament. We
also noted that our judiciary is very
powerful and can do whatever is
needed to protect the rights of the
citizens.
In case of any violation of a
Fundamental Right the aggrieved
person can go to a court for remedy.
But now, any person can go to court
against the violation of the
Fundamental Right, if it is of social
or public interest. It is called Public
Interest Litigation (PIL). Under the

matter if the judges find it in public
interest.

SCOPE OF RIGHTS

We began this chapter by discussing
the significance of rights. In much
of the chapter we have focussed only
on Fundamental Rights in the
Constitution. You might think that
Fundamental Rights granted by the
Constitution are the only rights
citizen have. This is not true. While
Fundamental Rights are the source
of all rights, our Constitution and
law offers a wider range of rights.
Over the years the scope of rights
has expanded.
Sometimes it leads to expansion
in the legal rights that the citizen can
enjoy. From time to time, the courts
gave judgments to expand the scope
of rights. Certain rights like right to
freedom of press, right to
information, and right to education
are derived from the Fundamental
Rights. Now school education has
become a right for Indian citizens.
The governments are responsible for
providing free and compulsory
education to all children up to the
age of 14 years. Parliament has
enacted a law giving the right to
DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS

information to the citizens. This Act
was made under the Fundamental
Right to freedom of thought and
expression. We have a right to seek
information from government
offices. Recently the Supreme Court
has expanded the meaning of the
right to life to include the right to
food. Also, rights are not limited only
to Fundamental Rights as
enumerated in the Constitution.
Constitution provides many more
rights, which may not be Fundamental
Rights. For example the right to
property is not a Fundamental Right
but it is a constitutional right. Right to
vote in elections is an important
constitutional right.
Sometimes the expansion takes
place in what is called human rights.
These are universal moral claims that
may or may not have been recognised
by law. In that sense these claims are
not rights going by the definition that
we presented earlier. With the
expansion of democracy all over the
world, there is greater pressure on
governments to accept these claims.
87

2021-22

Some international covenants have
also contributed to the expansion of
rights.

International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights
This international covenant recognises many
rights that are not directly a par t of the
Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution.
This has not yet become an international treaty.
But human right activists all over the world see
this as a standard of human rights. These include:
< right to work: opportunity to everyone to earn
livelihood by working
< right to safe and healthy working conditions,
fair wages that can provide decent standard of
living for the workers and their families
< right to adequate standard of living including
adequate food, clothing and housing
< right to social security and insurance
< right to health: medical care during illness,
special care for women during childbirth and
prevention of epidemics
< right to education: free and compulsory primary
education, equal access to higher education.

Thus the scope of rights has been
expanding and new rights are
evolving over time. They are result
of struggle of the people. New rights
emerge as societies develop or as
new constitutions are made. The
Constitution of South Africa guarantees
its citizens several kinds of new rights:
< Right to privacy, so that citizens
or their home cannot be searched,
their phones cannot be tapped,
their communication cannot be
opened.
< Right to an environment that is not
harmful to their health or wellbeing;
< Right to have access to adequate
housing.
< Right to have access to health care
services, sufficient food and water;
no one may be refused emergency
medical treatment.
Many people think that the right to
work, right to health, right to minimum
livelihood and right to privacy
should be made fundamental rights
in India as well. What do you think?

Amnesty International: An international organisation of volunteers who
campaign for human rights. This organisation brings out independent
reports on the violation of human rights all over the world.
Claim: Demand for legal or moral entitlements a person makes on fellow
citizens, society or the government.
Covenant: Promise made by individuals, groups or countries to uphold a
rule or principle. It is legally binding on the signatories to the agreement
or statement.
Dalit: A person who belongs to the castes which were considered low and
not touchable by others. Dalits are also known by other names such as
the Scheduled Castes, Depressed Classes etc.
Ethnic group: An ethnic group is a human population whose members
usually identify with each other on the basis of a common ancestry. People
of an ethnic group are united by cultural practices, religious beliefs and
historical memories.
Traffic: Selling and buying of men, women or children for immoral
purposes.
Summon: An order issued by a court asking a person to appear before it.
Writ: A formal document containing an order of the court to the
government issued only by High Court or the Supreme Court.

When Madhurima went to the property registration office, the
Registrar told her, “You can’t write your name as Madhurima Banerjee
d/o A. K. Banerjee. You are married, so you must give your husband’s
name. Your husband’s surname is Rao. So your name should be
changed to Madhurima Rao.” She did not agree. She said “If my
husband’s name has not changed after marriage, why should mine?”
In your opinion who is right in this dispute? And why?

Thousands of tribals and other forest dwellers gathered at Piparia in
Hoshangabad district in Madhya Pradesh to protest against their
proposed displacement from the Satpura National Park, Bori Wildlife
Sanctuary and Panchmarhi Wildlife Sanctuary. They argue that such
a displacement is an attack on their livelihood and beliefs. Government
claims that their displacement is essential for the development of
the area and for protection of wildlife. Write a petition on behalf of
the forest dwellers to the NHRC, a response from the government
and a report of the NHRC on this matter.

Draw a web interconnecting different rights discussed in this chapter.
For example right to freedom of movement is connected to the freedom
of occupation. One reason for this is that freedom of movement enables
a person to go to place of work within one’s village or city or to another
village, city or state. Similarly this right can be used for pilgrimage,
connected with freedom to follow one’s religion. Draw a circle for
each right and mark arrows that show connection between or among
different rights. For each arrow, give an example that shows the
linkage.

In every chapter we have done an exercise on reading the newspaper. Let
us now try to write for the newspaper. Take any example from the reports
discussed in this chapter or any other local example that you are familiar
with and write the following:
< Letter to the editor highlighting a case of human rights violation.
< Press release by a human rights organisation.
< A headline and a news item concerning a Supreme Court order
related to Fundamental Rights.
< Editorial on growing incidents of custodial violence.
Put these together and make a newspaper for your school notice board.
