CHAPTER 2

CONSTITUTIONAL
DESIGN

OVERVIEW
We noted in the previous chapter that in a democracy the rulers are not
free to do what they like. There are certain basic rules that the citizens
and the government have to follow. All such rules together are called
constitution. As the supreme law of the country, the constitution determines
the rights of citizens, the powers of the government and how the government
should function.
In this chapter we ask some basic questions about the constitutional
design of a democracy. Why do we need a constitution? How are the
constitutions drawn up? Who designs them and in what way? What are
the values that shape the constitutions in democratic states? Once a
constitution is accepted, can we make changes later as required by the
changing conditions?
One recent instance of designing constitution for a democratic state is
that of South Africa. We begin this chapter by looking at what happened
there and how the South Africans went about this task of designing their
constitution. Then we turn to how the Indian Constitution was made,
what its foundational values are, and how it provides a good framework
for the conduct of citizens’ life and that of the government.

This was Nelson Mandela, being
tried for treason by the white South
African government. He and seven

oppose the apartheid regime in his
country. He spent the next 28 years
in South Africa’s most dreaded
prison, Robben Island.

apartheid divided the people and
labelled them on the basis of their
skin colour. The native people of
South Africa are black in colour.
They made up about three-fourth
of the population and were called
‘blacks’. Besides these two groups,
there were people of mixed races
who were called ‘coloured’ and
people who migrated from India.
The white rulers treated all nonwhites as inferiors. The non-whites
did not have voting rights.
The apartheid system was
particularly oppressive for the
blacks. They were forbidden from
living in white areas. They could
work in white areas only if they had
a permit. Trains, buses, taxis,

Apartheid was the name of a system
of racial discrimination unique to
South Africa. The white Europeans
imposed this system on South
Africa. During the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, the trading
companies from Europe occupied it
with arms and force, in the way they
occupied India. But unlike India, a
large number of ‘whites’ had settled
in South Africa and became the
local rulers. The system of

the whites and blacks. This was
called segregation. They could not
even visit the churches where the
whites worshipped. Blacks could not
form associations or protest against
the terrible treatment.
Since 1950, the blacks, coloured
and Indians fought against the
apartheid system. They launched
protest marches and strikes. The
African National Congress (ANC) was
the umbrella organisation that led
the struggle against the policies of
segregation. This included many
workers’ unions and the Communist
Party. Many sensitive whites also
joined the ANC to oppose apartheid
and played a leading role in this
struggle. Several countries denounced apartheid as unjust and
racist. But the white racist government continued to rule by detaining, torturing and killing thousands
of black and coloured people.

As protests and struggles against
apartheid had increased, the
government realised that they could
no longer keep the blacks under
their rule through repression. The
white regime changed its policies.
Discriminatory laws were repealed.
Ban on political parties and
restrictions on the media were lifted.
After 28 years of imprisonment,
Nelson Mandela walked out of the
jail as a free man. Finally, at the
midnight of 26 April 1994, the new

national flag of the Republic of South
Africa was unfurled marking the
newly born democracy in the world.
The apartheid government came to
an end, paving way for the formation
of a multi-racial government.
How did this come about? Let us
hear Mandela, the first president of
this new South Africa, on this extraordinary transition:
“ Historical enemies succeeded in
negotiating a peaceful transition from
apartheid to democracy exactly because
we were prepared to accept the inherent
capacity for goodness in the other. My
wish is that South Africans never give up
on the belief in goodness, that they
cherish that faith in human beings is the
cornerstone of our democracy.”

After the emergence of the new
democratic South Africa, black
leaders appealed to fellow blacks to
forgive the whites for the atrocities
they had committed while in power.
They said let us build a new South
Africa based on equality of all races
and men and women, on democratic
values, social justice and human
rights. The party that ruled through
oppression and brutal killings and
the party that led the freedom
struggle sat together to draw up a
common constitution.
After two years of discussion and
debate they came out with one of the
finest constitutions the world has
ever had. This constitution gave to
its citizens the most extensive rights
available in any country. Together,
they decided that in the search for
a solution to the problems, nobody
should be excluded, no one should
be treated as a demon. They agreed
that everybody should become part
of the solution, whatever they might
have done or represented in the
past. The preamble to the South
African Constitution (see page 28)
sums up this spirit.

The South African constitution
inspires democrats all over the
world. A state denounced by the
entire world till 1994 as the most
undemocratic one is now seen as a
model of democracy. What made this
change
possible
was
the
determination of the people of South
Africa to work together, to transform
bitter experiences into the binding
glue of a rainbow nation. Speaking
on the South African Constitution,
Mandela said:
“The Constitution of South Africa speaks
of both the past and the future. On the one
hand, it is a solemn pact in which we, as
South Africans, declare to one another that
we shall never permit a repetition of our
racist, brutal and repressive past. But it is
more than that. It is also a charter for the
transformation of our country into one
which is truly shared by all its people — a
country which in the fullest sense belongs
to all of us, black and white, women and
men.”
This image captures the spirit of South Africa today. South
Africans call themselves a ‘rainbow nation’. Can you guess
why?

2.2 WHY

DO WE NEED A CONSTITUTION?

The South African example is a good
way to understand why we need a
constitution
and
what
do
constitutions do. The oppressor and
the oppressed in this new democracy
were planning to live together as
equals. It was not going to be easy for
them to trust each other. They had
CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

their fears. They wanted to safeguard
their interests. The black majority
was keen to ensure that the
democratic principle of majority rule
was not compromised. They wanted
substantial social and economic
rights. The white minority was keen
to protect its privileges and property.
21

2021-22

After long negotiations both parties
agreed to a compromise. The whites
agreed to the principle of majority
rule and that of one person one vote.
They also agreed to accept some
basic rights for the poor and the
workers. The blacks agreed that
majority rule would not be absolute.
They agreed that the majority would
not take away the property of the white
minority. This compromise was not
easy. How was this compromise going
to be implemented? Even if they
managed to trust each other, what
was the guarantee that this trust will
not be broken in future?
The only way to build and
maintain trust in such a situation
is to write down some rules of the
game that everyone would abide by.
These rules lay down how the rulers
are to be chosen in future. These
rules also determine what the
elected governments are empowered
to do and what they cannot do.
Finally these rules decide the rights
of the citizen. These rules will work
only if the winner cannot change
them very easily. This is what the
South Africans did. They agreed on
some basic rules. They also agreed
that these rules will be supreme,
that no government will be able to
ignore these. This set of basic rules
is called a constitution.
Constitution making is not unique
to South Africa. Every country has
diverse groups of people. Their
relationship may not have been as
bad as that between the whites and
the blacks in South Africa. But all over
the world people have differences of
opinion and interests. Whether
democratic or not, most countries in
the world need to have these basic
rules. This applies not just to
governments. Any association needs
to have its constitution. It could be a
club in your area, a cooperative

society or a political party, they all
need a constitution.

A C T I V I T Y
Approach a club or cooperative society or union or
political party in your locality. Get a copy of their
rule book (it is often called Rules of Association)
and read it. Are these rules in accordance with
principles of democracy? Do they give membership
to any person without discrimination?

Thus, the constitution of a country
is a set of written rules that are
accepted by all people living together
in a country. Constitution is the
supreme law that determines the
relationship among people living in
a territory (called citizens) and also
the relationship between the people
and government. A constitution does
many things:
< First, it generates a degree of trust
and coordination that is necessary
for different kind of people to live
together;
< Second, it specifies how the
government will be constituted,
who will have power to take which
decisions;
< Third, it lays down limits on the
powers of the government and tells
us what the rights of the citizens
are; and
< Fourth,
it expresses the
aspirations of the people about
creating a good society.
All countries that have constitutions
are not necessarily democratic. But
all countries that are democratic will
have constitutions. After the War of
Independence against Great Britain,
the Americans gave themselves a
constitution. After the Revolution, the
French people approved a democratic
constitution. Since then it has
become a practice in all democracies
to have a written constitution.

OF THE

INDIAN CONSTITUTION

Like South Africa, India’s
Constitution was also drawn up
under very difficult circumstances.
The making of the constitution for a
huge and diverse country like India
was not an easy affair. At that time
the people of India were emerging
from the status of subjects to that
of citizens. The country was born
through a partition on the basis of
religious differences. This was a
traumatic experience for the people
of India and Pakistan.
Atleast ten lakh people were killed
on both sides of the border in
partition related violence. There was
another problem. The British had
left it to the rulers of the princely
states to decide whether they
wanted to merge with India or with
Pakistan or remain independent.
The merger of these princely states
was a difficult and uncertain task.
When the constitution was being
written, the future of the country did
not look as secure as it does today.
The makers of the constitution had
anxieties about the present and the
future of the country.

A C T I V I T Y
Speak to your grandparents or some other elders
in your locality. Ask them if they have any memory
of partition or independence or the making of the
constitution. What were their fears and hopes
about the country at that time? Discuss these in

path
Despite all these difficulties, there
was one big advantage for the
makers of the Indian Constitution.
Unlike South Africa, they did not
have to create a consensus about
what a democratic India should look
CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

like. Much of this consensus had
evolved during the freedom struggle.
Our national movement was not
merely a struggle against a foreign
rule. It was also a struggle to
rejuvenate our country and to
transform our society and politics.
There were sharp differences of
opinion within the freedom struggle
about the path India should take
after
Independence.
Such
differences exist even today. Yet
some basic ideas had come to be
accepted by almost everyone.
As far back as in 1928, Motilal
Nehru and eight other Congress
leaders drafted a constitution for
India. In 1931, the resolution at the
Karachi session of the Indian
National Congress dwelt on how
independent India’s constitution
should look like. Both these
documents were committed to the
inclusion of universal adult franchise,
right to freedom and equality and to
protecting the rights of minorities in
the constitution of independent India.
Thus some basic values were
accepted by all leaders much before
the Constituent Assembly met to
deliberate on the Constitution.
The familiarity with political
institutions of colonial rule also
helped develop an agreement over
the institutional design. The British
rule had given voting rights only to
a few. On that basis the British had
introduced very weak legislatures.
Elections were held in 1937 to
Provincial Legislatures and
Ministries all over British India.
These were not fully democratic
governments. But the experience
gained by Indians in the working of
the legislative institutions proved to
be very useful for the country in
setting up its own institutions and
23

2021-22

working in them. That is why the
Indian constitution adopted many
institutional details and procedures
from colonial laws like the Government
of India Act, 1935.
Years of thinking and deliberation
on the framework of the constitution
had another benefit. Our leaders
gained confidence to learn from
other countries, but on our own
terms. Many of our leaders were
inspired by the ideals of French
Revolution, the practice of
parliamentary democracy in Britain
and the Bill of Rights in the US. The
socialist revolution in Russia had
inspired many Indians to think of
shaping a system based on social
and economic equality. Yet they
were not simply imitating what
others had done. At each step they
were questioning whether these
things suited our country. All these
factors contributed to the making of
our Constitution.

Who, then, were the makers of the
Indian Constitution? You will find
here very brief sketch of some of the
leaders who played an important
role in making the Constitution.

A C T I V I T Y
Find out more about any member of the
Constituent Assembly from your state or region
who is not mentioned here. Collect a photograph
or make a sketch of that leader. Write a short
note on him or her, following the same style as
used here: Name (year of birth-year of death),
place of birth (by current political boundaries),
brief description of political activities; role played
after the Constituent Assembly.

The drafting of the document called
the constitution was done by an
assembly of elected representatives

called the Constituent Assembly.
Elections to the Constituent
Assembly were held in July 1946. Its
first meeting was held in December
1946. Soon after, the country was
divided into India and Pakistan. The
Constituent Assembly was also
divided into the Constituent Assembly
of India and that of Pakistan. The
Constituent Assembly that wrote
the Indian constitution had 299
members. The Assembly adopted
the Constitution on 26 November
1949 but it came into effect on 26
January 1950. To mark this day we
celebrate January 26 as Republic
Day every year.
Why should we accept the
Constitution made by this Assembly
more than six decades ago? We have
already noted one reason above.
The Constitution does not reflect the
views of its members alone. It
expresses a broad consensus of its
time. Many countries of the world
have had to rewrite their
Constitution afresh because the
basic rules were not acceptable to
all major social groups or political
parties. In some other countries, the
Constitution exists as a mere piece
of paper. No one actually follows it.
The experience of our Constitution
is different. Over the last half a
century, several groups have
questioned some provisions of the
Constitution. But no large social
group or political party has ever
questioned the legitimacy of the
Constitution itself. This is an unusual
achievement for any constitution.
The second reason for accepting
the Constitution is that the
Constituent Assembly represented
the people of India. There was no
universal adult franchise at that
time. So the Constituent Assembly
could not have been chosen directly
by all the people of India. It was

elected mainly by the members of
the existing Provincial Legislatures
that we mentioned above. This
ensured a fair geographical share of
members from all the regions of the
country. The Assembly was
dominated by the Indian National
Congress, the party that led India’s
freedom struggle. But the Congress
itself included a variety of political
groups and opinions. The Assembly
had many members who did not
agree with the Congress. In social
terms too, the Assembly represented
members from different language
groups, castes, classes, religions
and occupations. Even if the
Constituent Assembly was elected
by universal adult franchise, its
composition would not have been
very different.
Finally, the manner in which the
Constituent Assembly worked gives
sanctity to the Constitution. The

Constituent Assembly worked in a
systematic, open and consensual
manner. First some basic principles
were decided and agreed upon. Then
a Drafting Committee chaired by Dr.
B.R. Ambedkar prepared a draft
constitution for discussion. Several
rounds of thorough discussion took
place on the Draft Constitution,
clause by clause. More than two
thousand amendments were
considered.
The
members
deliberated for 114 days spread over
three years. Every document
presented and every word spoken in
the Constituent Assembly has been
recorded and preserved. These are
called ‘Constituent Assembly
Debates’. When printed, these
debates are 12 bulky volumes! These
debates provide the rationale behind
every provision of the Constitution.
These are used to interpret the
meaning of the Constitution.

In this book we shall study the

on different subjects. At this stage
let us begin by understanding the
overall philosophy of what our
Constitution is all about. We can do
this in two ways. We can
understand it by reading the views
of some of our major leaders on our
Constitution. But it is equally
important to read what the
Constitution says about its own
philosophy. This is what the
preamble to the Constitution does.
CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

Let us turn to these, one by one.

The Dream and the Promise
Some of you may have noticed a
name missing from the sketches of
the makers of the constitution:
Mahatma Gandhi. He was not a
member of the Constituent
Assembly. Yet there were many
members who followed his vision.
Years ago, writing in his magazine
Young India in 1931, he had spelt
out what he wanted the Constitution
to do:
25

2021-22

I shall strive for a constitution which will release India from all thralldom
and patronage … I shall work for an India in which the poorest shall feel that it
is their country in whose making they have an effective voice; an India in which
there shall be no high class and low class of people; an India in

can be no room in such an India for the curse of
untouchability or the curse of the intoxicating drinks
and drugs. Women will enjoy the same rights as men …
I shall be satisfied with nothing else.
This dream of an India that has
eliminated inequality was shared by
Dr. Ambedkar, who played a key role
in the making of the Constitution but
he had a different understanding of

how inequalities could be removed. He
often bitterly criticised Mahatma
Gandhi and his vision. In his concluding speech to the Constituent Assem
bly he stated his anxiety very clearly:

On the 26th of January 1950 we are going to enter a life of contradictions.
In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have

one vote one value. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our
social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one
value. How long shall we continue to live this life of contradictions? How long shall
we continue to deny equality in our social and economic life? If we continue to
deny it for long, we will do so only by putting our political democracy in peril.

Values that inspired and guided the
freedom struggle and were in turn
nurtured by it, formed the
foundation for India’s democracy.
These values are embedded in the
Preamble
of
the
Indian
Constitution. They guide all the

articles of the Indian Constitution.
The Constitution begins with a short
statement of its basic values. This
is called the Preamble to the
constitution. Taking inspiration
from American model, most
countries in the contemporary
world have chosen to begin their
constitutions with a preamble.

tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and
secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and

Honour those who suffered for justice and freedom in our land;
Respect those who have worked to build and develop our country; and
Believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity.
We therefore, through our freely elected representatives, adopt this Constitution as the supreme law of
the Republic so as to —
Heal the divisions of the past and establish a society based on democratic values, social justice and
fundamental human rights;
Lay the foundations for a democratic and open society in which government is based on the will of

WE, THE PEOPLE
OF INDIA
The constitution has
been drawn up and
enacted by the people
through their
representatives, and
not handed down to
them by a king or any
outside powers.

Let us read the Preamble of our Constitution very
carefully and understand the meaning of each of its
key words.
The Preamble of the Constitution reads like a poem
on democracy. It contains the philosophy on which the
entire Constitution has been built. It provides a standard
to examine and evaluate any law and action of
government, to find out whether it is good or bad. It is
the soul of the Indian Constitution.

SOVEREIGN
People have supreme
right to make
decisions on internal
as well as external
matters. No external
power can dictate the
government of India.

*

SOCIALIST

REPUBLIC
The head of the state
is an elected person
and not a hereditary
position.

JUSTICE
Citizens cannot be
discriminated on the
grounds of caste,
religion and gender.
Social inequalities
have to be reduced.
Government should
work for the welfare
of all, especially of
the disadvantaged
groups.

LIBERTY

Wealth is generated
socially and should be
shared equally by
society. Government
should regulate the
ownership of land and
industry to reduce
socio-economic
inequalities.

There are no
unreasonable
restrictions on the
citizens in what they
think, how they wish to
express their thoughts
and the way they wish
to follow up their
thoughts in action.

SECULAR
Citizens have
complete freedom to
follow any religion.
But there is no official
religion. Government
treats all religious
beliefs and practices
with equal respect.

EQUALITY
All are equal before
the law. The traditional
social inequalities
have to be ended. The
government should
ensure equal
opportunity for all.

DEMOCRA
TIC
DEMOCRATIC
A form of government
where people enjoy
equal political rights,
elect their rulers and
hold them accountable. The government
is run according to
some basic rules.

FRA
TERNITY
FRATERNITY
All of us should
behave as if we are
members of the same
family. No one should
treat a fellow citizen
as inferior.
Note: * The terms ‘Socialist’ and ‘Secular’ were added in
Preamble through the 42nd Constitutional Amendment
in 1976.

CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN

29

2021-22

Compare the Preambles to the constitutions of the United States of America, India and South Africa.
< Make a list of ideas that are common to all these three.
< Note down at least one of the major differences among these.
< Which of the three makes a reference to the past?
< Which of these does not invoke God?

Institutional design
A constitution is not merely a
statement of values and philosophy.
As we noted above, a constitution is
mainly about embodying these values
into institutional arrangements.
Much of the document called
Constitution of India is about these
arrangements. It is a very long and
detailed document. Therefore it needs
to be amended quite regularly to keep
it updated. Those who crafted the
Indian Constitution felt that it has to
be in accordance with people’s
aspirations and changes in society.
They did not see it as a sacred, static
and unalterable law. So, they made
provisions to incorporate changes
from time to time. These changes are
called constitutional amendments.
The Constitution describes the
institutional arrangements in a very
legal language. If you read the
Constitution for the first time, it can

be quite difficult to understand. Yet
the basic institutional design is not
very difficult to understand. Like any
Constitution,
the
Indian
Constitution lays down a procedure
for choosing persons to govern the
country. It defines who will have how
much power to take which decisions.
And it puts limits to what the
government can do by providing
some rights to the citizen that
cannot be violated. The remaining
three chapters in this book are about
these three aspects of the working
of Indian constitution. We shall look
at some key constitutional
provisions in each chapter and
understand how they work in
democratic politics. But this
textbook will not cover all the salient
features of the institutional design
in the Indian Constitution. Some
other aspects will be covered in your
textbook next year.

Apartheid: The official policy of racial separation and ill treatment of blacks
followed by the government of South Africa between 1948 and 1989.
Clause: A distinct section of a document.
Constituent Assembly: An assembly of people’s representatives that writes
a constitution for a country.
Constitution: Supreme law of a country, containing fundamental rules
governing the politics and society in a country.
Constitutional amendment: A change in the constitution made by the
supreme legislative body in a country.
Draft: A preliminary version of a legal document.
Philosophy: The most fundamental principles underlying one’s thoughts
and actions.
Preamble: An introductory statement in a constitution which states the
reasons and guiding values of the constitution.
Treason: The offence of attempting to overthrow the government of the
state to which the offender owes allegiance.
Tryst: A meeting or meeting place that has been agreed upon.

How did your school celebrate the Constitution Day on November
26th? Prepare a brief report.

Here are different opinions about what made India a democracy.
How much importance would you give to each of these factors?
a Democracy in India is a gift of the British rulers. We received training
to work with representative legislative institutions under the British
rule.
b Freedom Struggle challenged the colonial exploitation and denial
of different freedoms to Indians. Free India could not be anything
but democratic.
c We were lucky to have leaders who had democratic convictions.
The denial of democracy in several other newly independent
countries shows the important role of these leaders.

9

Read the following extract from a conduct book for ‘married women’,
published in 1912. ‘God has made the female species delicate and fragile
both physically and emotionally, pitiably incapable of self-defence. They are
destined thus by God to remain in male protection – of father, husband and son
– all their lives. Women should, therefore, not despair, but feel obliged that they
can dedicate themselves to the service of men’. Do you think the values

expressed in this para reflected the values underlying our
constitution? Or does this go against the constitutional values?
10

Read the following statements about a constitution. Give reasons
why each of these is true or not true.
a The authority of the rules of the constitution is the same as that of
any other law.
b Constitution lays down how different organs of the government will
be formed.
c Rights of citizens and limits on the power of the government are
laid down in the constitution.
d A constitution is about institutions, not about values

Follow the newspapers for any report on a discussion on any constitutional
amendment or demand for any constitutional amendment. You could, for
example, focus on the demand for constitutional amendment for reservation
for women in legislatures. Was there a public debate? What reasons were
put forward in favour of the amendment? How did different parties react to
the constitutional amendment? Did the amendment take place?
