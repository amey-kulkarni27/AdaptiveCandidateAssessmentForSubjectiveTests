What is Swidden Agriculture? Where is it practised?

It has many local names such as Lading in Southeast Asia, Milpa in Central America and Chena in Sri Lanka, etc. In India, Dhya, Penda, Bewar, Jhum, etc. are some of the local terms for Swidden agriculture.

Such plots are cultivated for a couple of years and then left fallen for 12 to 18 years for the forests to grow back.  "
