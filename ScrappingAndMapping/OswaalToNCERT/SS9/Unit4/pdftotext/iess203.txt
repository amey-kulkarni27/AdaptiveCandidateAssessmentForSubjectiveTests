Poverty as a Challenge

Chapter

Overview
This chapter deals with one of the most
difficult challenges faced by independent
India—poverty. After discussing this
multi-dimensional problem through
examples, the chapter discusses the way
poverty is seen in social sciences. Poverty
trends in India and the world are
illustrated through the concept of the
poverty line. Causes of poverty as well as
anti-poverty measures taken by the
government are also discussed. The
chapter ends with broadening the official
concept of poverty into human poverty.

Introduction
In our daily life, we come across many
people who we think are poor. They could
be landless labourers in villages or people
living in overcrowded jhuggis in cities. They
could be daily wage workers at
construction sites or child workers in

dhabas. They could also be beggars with
children in tatters. We see poverty all
around us. In fact, every fifth person in
India is poor. (This means, roughly 270
million (or 27 crore) people in India live
in poverty 2011-12.) This also means that
India has the largest single concentration
of the poor in the world. This illustrates
the seriousness of the challenge.

Two Typical Cases of Poverty
Urban Case
Thirty-three year old Ram Saran works
as a daily-wage labourer in a wheat
flour mill near Ranchi in Jharkhand.
He manages to earn around Rs 1,500
a month when he finds employment,
which is not often. The money is not
enough to sustain his family of six—
that includes his wife and four children
aged between 12 years to six months.

He has to send money home to his old
parents who live in a village near
Ramgarh. His father a landless
labourer, depends on Ram Saran and
his brother who lives in Hazaribagh,
for sustenance. Ram Saran lives in a
one-room rented house in a crowded
basti in the outskirts of the city. It’s a
temporary shack built of bricks and
clay tiles. His wife Santa Devi, works
as a part time maid in a few houses
and manages to earn another Rs 800.
They manage a meagre meal of dal and
rice twice a day, but there’s never
enough for all of them. His elder son
works as a helper in a tea shop to
supplement the family income and
earns another Rs 300, while his 10year-old daughter takes care of the
younger siblings. None of the children
go to school. They have only two pairs
of hand-me-down clothes each. New
ones are bought only when the old
clothes become unwearable. Shoes are
a luxury. The younger kids are
undernourished. They have no access
to healthcare when they fall ill.

Rural case
Lakha Singh belongs to a small village
near Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. His
family doesn’t own any land, so they
do odd jobs for the big farmers. Work
is erratic and so is income. At times
they get paid Rs 50 for a hard day’s
work. But often it’s in kind like a few
kilograms of wheat or dal or even
vegetables for toiling in the farm
through the day. The family of eight
cannot always manage two square
meals a day. Lakha lives in a kuchha
hut on the outskirts of the village.
The women of the family spend the
day chopping fodder and collecting
firewood in the fields. His father a
TB patient, passed away two years
ago due to lack of medication. His
mother now suffers from the same
disease and life is slowly ebbing away.
Although, the village has a primary
school, Lakha never went there. He
had to start earning when he was 10
years old. New clothes happen once
in a few years. Even soap and oil are
a luxury for the family.
Study the above cases of poverty
and discuss the following issues
related to poverty:

These two typical cases illustrate many
dimensions of poverty. They show that
poverty means hunger and lack of shelter.
It also is a situation in which parents are
not able to send their children to school
or a situation where sick people cannot
afford treatment. Poverty also means lack
of clean water and sanitation facilities. It
also means lack of a regular job at a
minimum decent level. Above all it means
living with a sense of helplessness. Poor
people are in a situation in which they
are ill-treated at almost every place, in
farms, factories, government offices,
hospitals, railway stations etc. Obviously,
nobody would like to live in poverty.
One of the biggest challenges of
independent India has been to bring
millions of its people out of abject poverty.
Mahatama Gandhi always insisted that
India would be truly independent only
when the poorest of its people become free
of human suffering.

Poverty as seen by social scientists
Since poverty has many facets, social
scientists look at it through a variety of
indicators. Usually the indicators used
relate to the levels of income and
consumption. But now poverty is looked
through other social indicators like
illiteracy level, lack of general resistance
due to malnutrition, lack of access to
healthcare, lack of job opportunities, lack
of access to safe drinking water,
sanitation etc. Analysis of poverty based
on social exclusion and vulnerability is
now becoming very common (see box).
Social exclusion
According to this concept, poverty
must be seen in terms of the poor
having to live only in a poor
surrounding with other poor people,
excluded from enjoying social equality
of better-of f people in better
surroundings. Social exclusion can be

both a cause as well as a
consequence of poverty in the usual
sense. Broadly, it is a process through
which individuals or groups are
excluded from facilities, benefits and
opportunities that others (their
“betters”) enjoy. A typical example is
the working of the caste system in
India in which people belonging to
certain castes are excluded from
equal opportunities. Social exclusion
thus may lead to, but can cause more
damage than, having a very low
income.
Vulnerability
Vulnerability to poverty is a measure,
which describes the greater
probability of certain communities
(say, members of a backward caste)
or individuals (such as a widow or a
physically handicapped person) of
becoming, or remaining, poor in the
coming years. Vulnerability is
determined by the options available
to different communities for finding
an alternative living in terms of
assets, education, health and job
opportunities. Further, it is analysed
on the basis of the greater risks these
groups face at the time of natural
disasters (earthquakes, tsunami),
terrorism etc. Additional analysis is
made of their social and economic
ability to handle these risks. In fact,
vulnerability describes the greater
probability of being more adversely
affected than other people when bad
time comes for everybody, whether a
flood or an earthquake or simply a
fall in the availability of jobs!

Poverty Line
At the centre of the discussion on poverty
is usually the concept of the “poverty line”.
A common method used to measure
poverty is based on the income or
Poverty as a challenge

2021–22

31

consumption levels. A person is
considered poor if his or her income or
consumption level falls below a given
“minimum level” necessary to fulfill the
basic needs. What is necessary to satisfy
the basic needs is different at different
times and in different countries.
Therefore, poverty line may vary with time
and place. Each country uses an
imaginary line that is considered
appropriate for its existing level of
development and its accepted minimum
social norms. For example, a person not
having a car in the United States may be
considered poor. In India, owning of a car
is still considered a luxury.
While determining the poverty line in
India, a minimum level of food requirement,
clothing, fo otwear, fuel and light,
educational and medical requirement, etc.,
are determined for subsistence. These
physical quantities are multiplied by their
prices in rupees. The present formula for
food requirement while estimating the
poverty line is based on the desired
calorie requirement. Food items, such as
cereals, pulses, vegetable, milk, oil, sugar,
etc., together provide these needed
calories. The calorie needs vary depending
on age, sex and the type of work that a
person does. The accepted average calorie
requirement in India is 2400 calories per
person per day in rural areas and 2100
calories per person per day in urban
areas. Since people living in rural areas
engage themselves in more physical work,
calorie requirements in rural areas are
considered to be higher than in urban
areas. The monetary expenditure per
capita needed for buying these calorie
requirements in terms of food grains, etc.,
is revised periodically taking into
consideration the rise in prices.
On the basis of these calculations, for
the year 2011–12, the poverty line for a
person was fixed at Rs 816 per month for
rural areas and Rs 1000 for urban areas.
Despite less calorie requirement,the
32

Economics

2021–22

higher amount for urban areas has been
fixed because of high prices of many
essential products in urban centres. In
this way in the year 2011-12, a family of
five members living in rural areas and
earning less than about Rs 4,080 per
month will be below the poverty line. A
similar family in the urban areas would
need a minimum of Rs 5,000 per month
to meet their basic requirements. The
poverty line is estimated periodically
(normally every five years) by conducting
sample surveys. These surveys are
carried out by the National Sample Survey
O rganisation (NSSO). However, for
making comparisons between developing
countries,
many
international
organisations like the World Bank use a
uniform standard for the poverty line:
minimum availability of the equivalent of
$1.90 per person per day (2011, ppp).

Let’s Discuss
Discuss the following:
•

Why do different countries use different
poverty lines?

•

What do you think would be the
“minimum necessary level” in your
locality?

Poverty Estimates
It is clear from Table 3.1 that there is a
substantial decline in poverty ratios in
India from about 45 per cent in 1993-94
to 37.2 per cent in 2004–05. The
proportion of people below poverty line
further came down to about 22 per cent
in 2011–12. If the trend continues, people
below poverty line may come down to less
than 20 per cent in the next few years.
Although the percentage of people living
under poverty declined in the earlier two
decades (1973–1993), the number of poor
declined from 407 million in 2004–05 to
270 million in 2011–12 with an average
annual decline of 2.2 percentage points
during 2004–05 to 2011–12.

Let’s Discuss
Study Table 3.1 and answer the following
questions:
• Even if poverty ratio declined between
1993–94 and 2004–05, why did the
number of poor remain at about 407
million?
• Are the dynamics of poverty reduction
the same in rural and urban India?

Vulnerable Groups
The proportion of people below poverty line
is also not same for all social groups and
economic categories in India. Social
groups, which are most vulnerable to
poverty are Scheduled Caste and
Scheduled Tribe households. Similarly,

among the economic groups, the most
vulnerable groups are the rural
agricultural labour households and the
urban casual labour households. Graph
3.1 shows the percentage of poor people
in all these groups. Although the average
for people below poverty line for all groups
in India is 22, 43 out of 100 people
belonging to Scheduled Tribes are not
able to meet their basic needs. Similarly,
34 per cent of casual workers in urban
areas are below poverty line. About 34
per cent of casual labour farm (in rural
areas) and 29 per cent of Scheduled
C a s t e s a r e a l s o p o o r. The double
disadvantage of being a landless casual
wage labour household in the socially
disadvantaged social groups of the

scheduled caste or the scheduled tribe
population highlights the seriousness of
the problem. Some recent studies have
shown that except for the scheduled tribe
households, all the other three groups (i.e.
scheduled castes, rural agricultural
labourers and the urban casual labour
households) have seen a decline in poverty
in the 1990s.
Apart from these social groups, there
is also inequality of incomes within a
family. In poor families all suffer, but some
suffer more than others. In some cases
women, elderly people and female infants
are denied equal access to resources
available to the family.

Story of Sivaraman
Sivaraman lives in a small village
near Karur town in Tamil Nadu. Karur
is famous for its handloom and
powerloom fabrics. There are a 100
families in the village. Sivaraman an
Aryunthathiyar (cobbler) by caste now
works as an agricultural labourer for
Rs 160 per day. But that’s only for
five to six months in a year. At other
times, he does odd jobs in the town.
His wife Sasikala too works with him.
But she can rarely find work these
days, and even if she does, she’s paid
Rs 100 per day for the same work that
Sivaraman does. There are eight
members in the family. Sivaraman’s
65 year old widowed mother is ill and

needs to be helped with her daily
chores. He has a 25-year -old
unmarried sister and four children
aged between 1 year to 16 years.
Three of them are girls, the youngest
is a son. None of the girls go to school.
Buying books and other things for
school-going girls is a luxury he
cannot afford. Also, he has to get them
married at some point of time so he
doesn’t want to spend on their
education now. His mother has lost
interest in life and is just waiting to
die someday. His sister and elder
daughter take care of the household.
Sivaraman plans to send his son to
school when he comes of age. His
unmarried sister does not get along
with his wife. Sasikala finds her a
burden but Sivaraman can’t find a
suitable groom due to lack of money.
Although the family has difficulty in
arranging two meals a day,
Sivaraman manages to buy milk once
in a while, but only for his son.

Let’s Discuss
Observe some of the poor families
around you and try to find the following:
•
•
•
•

Which social and economic group do
they belong to?
Who are the earning members in the
family?
What is the condition of the old people
in the family?
Are all the children (boys and girls)
attending schools?

Inter-State Disparities
Poverty in India also has another aspect
or dimension. The proportion of poor
people is not the same in every state.
Although state level poverty has witnessed
a secular decline from the levels of early

seventies, the success rate of reducing
poverty varies from state to state. Recent
estimates show while the all India Head
Count Ratio (HCR) was 21.9 per cent in
2011-12 states like Madhya Pradesh,
Assam, Uttar Pardesh, Bihar and Odisha
had above all India poverty level. As the
Graph 3.2 shows, Bihar and Odisha
continue to be the two poorest states with
poverty ratios of 33.7 and 32.6 per cent
respectively. Along with rural poverty,
urban poverty is also high in Odisha,
Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.
In comparison, there has been a
significant decline in poverty in Kerala,
Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil
Nadu, Gujarat and West Bengal. States
like Punjab and Haryana have
traditionally succeeded in reducing
poverty with the help of high agricultural
growth rates. Kerala has focused more on
human resource development. In West
Bengal, land reform measures have
helped in reducing poverty. In Andhra
Pradesh and Tamil Nadu public
distribution of food grains could have been
responsible for the improvement.

Global Poverty Scenario
The proportion of people in different
countries living in extreme economic
poverty— defined by the World Bank as
living on less than $1.90 per day—has
fallen from 36 per cent in 1990 to 10 per cent
in 2015. Although there has been a
substantial reduction in global poverty, it
is marked with great regional differences.
Poverty declined substantially in China
and Southeast Asian countries as a result
of rapid economic growth and massive
investments in human resource
development. Number of poors in China
has come down from 88.3 per cent in 1981
to 14.7 per cent in 2008 to 0.6 per cent
in 2019. In the countries of South Asia

percentage of the poor, the number of
poor has also declined significantly from
510.4 million in 2005 to 274.5 million in
2013. Because of different poverty line
definition, poverty in India is also shown
higher than the national estimates.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, poverty in fact
declined from 51 per cent in 2005 to 40.2
per cent in 2018 (see graph 3.3). In Latin
America, the ratio of poverty has also
declined from 10 per cent in 2005 to 4
per cent in 2018 (see graph 3.3). Poverty
has also resurfaced in some of the former
socialist countries like Russia, where
officially it was non-existent earlier. Table
3.2 shows the proportion of people living
under poverty in different countries as
defined by the international poverty line
(means population below $1.90 a day).

Causes of Poverty
There were a number of causes for the
widespread poverty in India. One
historical reason is the low level of
economic development under the British
colonial administration. The policies of
the colonial government ruined traditional
handicrafts and discouraged development
of industries like textiles. The low rate of
growth persisted until the nineteeneighties. This resulted in less job
opportunities and low growth rate of
incomes. This was accompanied by a high
growth rate of population. The two
combined to make the growth rate of per
capita income very low. The failure at both
the fronts: promotion of economic growth
and population control perpetuated the
cycle of poverty.
With the spread of irrigation and the
Green revolution, many job opportunities
were created in the agriculture sector. But
the effects were limited to some parts of
India. The industries, both in the public
and the private sector, did provide some
jobs. But these were not enough to absorb
all the job seekers. Unable to find proper
jobs in cities, many people started working
as
rickshaw
pullers,
vendors,
construction workers, domestic servants
etc. With irregular small incomes, these
people could not afford expensive housing.
They started living in slums on the
outskirts of the cities and the problems
of poverty, largely a rural phenomenon
also became the feature of the urban
sector.
Another feature of high poverty rates
has been the huge income inequalities.
One of the major reasons for this is the
unequal distribution of land and other
resources. Despite many policies, we have
not been able to tackle the issue in a
meaningful manner. Major policy
initiatives like land reforms which aimed
at redistribution of assets in rural areas
have not been implemented properly and
38

Economics

2021–22

effectively by most of the state
governments. Since lack of land resources
has been one of the major causes of
poverty in India, proper implementation
of policy could have improved the life of
millions of rural poor.
Many other socio-cultural and
economic factors also are responsible for
poverty. In order to fulfil social obligations
and observe religious ceremonies, people
in India, including the very poor, spend a
lot of money. Small farmers need money
to buy agricultural inputs like seeds,
fertilizer, pesticides etc. Since poor people
hardly have any savings, they borrow.
Unable to repay because of poverty, they
become victims of indebtedness. So the
high level of indebtedness is both the
cause and effect of poverty.

Anti-Poverty Measures
Removal of poverty has been one of the
major objectives of Indian developmental
strategy. The current anti-poverty
strategy of the government is based
broadly on two planks (1) promotion of
economic growth (2) targeted anti-poverty
programmes.
Over a period of thirty years lasting
up to the early eighties, there were little
per capita income growth and not much
reduction in poverty. Official poverty
estimates which were about 45 per cent
in the early 1950s remained the same even
in the early eighties. Since the eighties,
India’s economic growth has been one of
the fastest in the world. The growth rate
jumped from the average of about 3.5 per
cent a year in the 1970s to about 6 per
cent during the 1980s and 1990s. The
higher growth rates have helped
significantly in the reduction of poverty.
Therefore, it is becoming clear that there
is a strong link between economic growth
and poverty reduction. Economic growth
widens opportunities and provides the
resources needed to invest in human
development. This also encourages people

to send their children, including the girl
child, to schools in the hope of getting
better economic returns from investing
in education. However, the poor may not
be able to take direct advantage from the
opportunities created by economic
growth. Moreover, growth in the
agriculture sector is much below
expectations. This has a direct bearing
on poverty as a large number of poor
people live in villages and are dependent
on agriculture.
In these circumstances, there is a
clear need for targeted anti-poverty
programmes. Although there are so many
schemes which are formulated to affect
poverty directly or indirectly, some of
them are worth mentioning. Mahatma
Gandhi National Rural Employment
Guarantee Act, 2005 aims to provide 100
days of wage employment to every
household to ensure livelihood security
in rural areas. It also aimed at sustainable
development to address the cause of
draught, deforestration and soil erosion.
One-third of the proposed jobs have been
reserved for women. The scheme provided
employment to 220 crores person days of
employment to 4.78 crore households.
The share of SC, ST, Women person days
in the scheme are 23 per cent, 17 per
cent and 53 per cent respectively. The
average wage has increased from 65 in
2006–07 to 132 in 2013–14. Recently, in
March 2018, the wage rate for unskilled
manual workers has been revised, state
wise, the range of wage rate for different
states and union territories lies in
between ` 281 per day (for the workers in
Haryana) to ` 168 per day (for the workers
of Bihar and Jharkhand).
Prime Minister Rozgar Yozana (PMRY)
is another scheme which was started in
1993. The aim of the programme is to
create self-employment opportunities

for educated unemployed youth in rural
areas and small towns. They are helped in
setting up small business and industries.
Rural Employment Generation Programme
(REGP) was launched in 1995. The aim of
the programme is to create selfemployment opportunities in rural areas
and small towns. A target for creating 25
lakh new jobs has been set for the
programme under the Tenth Five Year
plan. Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar
Yojana (SGSY) was launched in 1999. The
programme aims at bringing the assisted
poor families above the poverty line by
organising them into self help groups
through a mix of bank credit and
government subsidy. Under the Pradhan
Mantri Gramodaya Yozana (PMGY)
launched in 2000, additional central
assistance is given to states for basic
services such as primary health, primary
education, rural shelter, rural drinking
water and rural electrification. A nother
important scheme is Antyodaya Anna
Yozana (A AY) about which you will be
reading more in the next chapter.
The results of these programmes have
been mixed. One of the major reasons
for less effectiveness is the lack of proper
implementation and right targeting.
Moreover, there has be en a lot of
overlapping of schemes. Despite good
intentions, the benefits of these schemes
are not fully reached to the deserving
poor. Therefore, the major emphasis in
recent years is on proper monitoring of
all the poverty alleviation programmes.
The Challenges Ahead
Poverty has certainly declined in India.
But despite the progress, poverty
reduction
remains
I ndia’s
most
compelling challenge. Wide disparities in
poverty are visible between rural and
urban areas and among different states.
Poverty as a challenge

2021–22

39

Certain social and economic groups are
more vulnerable to poverty. Poverty
reduction is expected to make better
progress in the next ten to fifteen years.
This would be possible mainly due to
higher economic growth, increasing stress
on universal free elementary education,
declining population growth, increasing
empowerment of the women and the
economically weaker sections of society.
The of ficial definition of poverty,
however, captures only a limited part of
what poverty really means to people. It is
about a “minimum” subsistence level of
living rather than a “reasonable” level of
living. Many scholars advocate that we
must broaden the concept into human
poverty. A large number of people may
have been able to feed themselves. But

do they have education? Or shelter? Or
health care? Or job security? Or selfconfidence? Are they free from caste and
gender discrimination? Is the practice of
child labour still common? Worldwide
experience shows that with development,
the definition of what constitutes poverty
also changes. Eradication of poverty is
always a moving target. Hopefully we will
be able to provide the minimum
“necessary” in terms of only income to
all people by the end of the next decade.
But the target will move on for many of
the bigger challenges that still remain:
providing health care, education and job
security for all, and achieving gender
equality and dignity for the poor. These
will be even bigger tasks.

Summary
You have seen in this chapter that poverty has many dimensions. Normally, this
is measured through the concept of “poverty line”. Through this concept we
analysed main global and national trends in poverty. But in recent years, analysis
of poverty is becoming rich through a variety of new concepts like social exclusion.
Similarly, the challenge is becoming bigger as scholars are broadening the concept
into human poverty.
