How do the early attempts to classify the chemical elements differ from the modern attempt ? Which of the two is better and why ? Give examples.,"The early attempts to classify elements were made on the basis of atomic masses of the elements. Modern basis is the atomic number. This is better because now it is established that atomic number of an element is the fundamental property. Further there are certain anomalies in Mendeleev’s periodic table such as the position of isotopes and misplacements of certain elements, e.g. Argon is placed (Atomic mass - 40, atomic number = 18) before potassium in Mendeleev’s periodic table (Atomic mass = 39, At. no = 19).","The main credit for classifying elements goes to Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeléev, a Russian chemist. He was the most important contributor to the early development of a Periodic Table of elements wherein the elements were arranged on the basis of their fundamental property, the atomic mass, and also on the similarity of chemical properties. Dmitri lvanovich Mendeléev (1834-1907) Dmitri lvanovich Mendeléev was born in Tobolsk in Western Siberia, Russia on 8 February 1834. After his early education, Mendeléev could join a university only due to the efforts of his mother. Dedicating his investigations to his mother he wrote, “She instructed with example, corrected with love and travelled with me to places spending her last resources and strength. She knew that with the aid of science without violence, with love but firmness, all superstitions, untruth and errors can be removed.” The arrangement of elements he proposed is called Mendeléev’s Periodic Table. The Periodic Table proved to be the unifying principle in chemistry. It was the motivation for the discovery of some new elements. When Mendeléev started his work, 63 elements were known. He examined the relationship between the atomic masses of the elements and their physical and chemical properties. Among chemical properties, Mendeléev concentrated on the compounds formed by elements with oxygen and hydrogen. He selected hydrogen and oxygen as they are very reactive and formed compounds with most elements. The formulae of the hydrides and oxides formed by an element were treated as one of the basic properties of an element for its classification. He then took 63 cards and on each card he wrote down the properties of one element. He sorted out the elements with similar properties and pinned the cards together on a wall. He observed that most of the elements got a place in a Periodic Table and were arranged in the order of their increasing atomic masses. It was also observed that there occurs a periodic recurrence of elements with similar physical and chemical properties. On this basis, Mendeléev formulated a Periodic Law, which states that ‘the properties of elements are the periodic function of their atomic masses’. Mendeléev’s Periodic Table contains vertical columns called ‘groups’ and horizontal rows called ‘periods’ (Table 5.4).

What are metalloids ? How many electrons can be present in the valency shell of their atoms ? In what part of the periodic table these are located ? What type of oxide are formed by these elements ?,"Metalloids are elements which resemble both metals and non-metals. The valency shell of metalloids contain 3, 4, 5, 6 elements starting from periods 2 to 5 respectively. They are found on the right side of the table in the zig-zag column, e.g., boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic etc. They form amphoteric oxides.","As we can see, the metals like Na and Mg are towards the left-hand side of the Periodic Table while the non-metals like sulphur and chlorine are found on the right-hand side. In the middle, we have silicon, which is classified as a semi-metal or metalloid because it exhibits some properties of both metals and non-metals. In the Modern Periodic Table, a zig-zag line separates metals from non-metals. The borderline elements – boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, tellurium and polonium – are intermediate in properties and are called metalloids or semi-metals. As you have seen in Chapter 3, metals tend to lose electrons while forming bonds, that is, they are electropositive in nature.

What is electronegativity ? How it is different from electron affinity ?,Though both electronegativity and electron affinity refer to the attraction of electron but are used in different context. Electronegativity refers to the attraction of bonding electron or shared pair of electron whereas electron affinity refers to the attraction of electron by an isolated gaseous atoms. filled from group 1 to group 18 and the shell does not change.,"electrons is decreasing because the outermost electrons are farther away from the nucleus. Therefore, these can be lost easily. Hence metallic character decreases across a period and increases down a group. Non-metals, on the other hand, are electronegative. They tend to form bonds by gaining electrons. Let us learn about the variation of this property.

What is the basic difference between a group and a period in terms of electronic configuration ?,"In a group, though the number of shells increases as we move downward, but the number of electrons in the outermost shell remains the same. In a period, as we move from left to right, the outermost shell or valence shell gets progressively","You will find that these elements of second period do not have the same number of valence electrons, but they contain the same number of shells. You also observe that the number of valence shell electrons increases by one unit, as the atomic number increases by one unit on moving from left to right in a period. Or we can say that atoms of different elements with the same number of occupied shells are placed in the same period. Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl and Ar belong to the third period of the Modern Periodic Table, since the electrons in the atoms of these elements are filled in K, L and M shells. Write the electronic configuration of these elements and confirm the above statement. Each period marks a new electronic shell getting filled. 87
 How do you think the tendency to lose electrons changes in a group? How will this tendency change in a period?
 As the effective nuclear charge acting on the valence shell electrons increases across a period, the tendency to lose electrons will decrease. Down the group, the effective nuclear charge experienced by valence

"An element ‘X’ is liquid, non-metallic. Can you predict its position in the periodic table ?","As the element ‘X’ is non-metallic, it may be belonging to group 17. In group 17, first two elements are gases. Metallic character of elements (non-metals) increases on moving down the group. Therefore, the element ‘X’ may be located in group 17 and 3rd or 4th period of the periodic table.","Examine elements of the third period and classify them as metals and non-metals. On which side of the Periodic Table do you find the metals? On which side of the Periodic Table do you find the non-metals?
 As we can see, the metals like Na and Mg are towards the left-hand side of the Periodic Table while the non-metals like sulphur and chlorine are found on the right-hand side. In the middle, we have silicon, which is classified as a semi-metal or metalloid because it exhibits some properties of both metals and non-metals. In the Modern Periodic Table, a zig-zag line separates metals from non-metals.

As you have seen in Chapter 3, metals tend to lose electrons while forming bonds, that is, they are electropositive in nature.
 As the trends in the electronegativity show, non-metals are found on the right-hand side of the Periodic Table towards the top. These trends also help us to predict the nature of oxides formed by the elements because it is known to you that the oxides of metals are basic and that of non-metals are acidic in general.

"What are the properties of carbon that lead to the formation of fullerenes. Name two other compounds which are allotropes. In which of these compounds, all the four valencies are satisfied ? 3","Tetravalency and catenation are the properties of carbon that gives the formation of fullerenes. Because of these properties, carbon forms two allotropes-diamond and graphite, out of which, all the four valencies of carbon are satisfied in diamond.","These two different structures result in diamond and graphite having very different physical properties even though their chemical properties are the same. Diamond is the hardest substance known while graphite is smooth and slippery. Graphite is also a very good conductor of electricity unlike other non-metals that you studied in the previous Chapter. Diamonds can be synthesised by subjecting pure carbon to very high pressure and temperature. These synthetic diamonds are small but are otherwise indistinguishable from natural diamonds. Fullerenes form another class of carbon allotropes. The first one to be identified was C-60 which has carbon atoms arranged in the shape of a football. Since this looked like the geodesic dome designed by the US architect Buckminster Fuller, the molecule was named fullerene.

"In human, digestion starts in mouth. Which component of food breaks down in mouth ?

Energy and food material are also required by plants. From where do plants fulfill these requirements ?,"Plants obtain energy and food material from inorganic sources in the form of carbon dioxide and water by the process of photosynthesis. During the process of photosynthesis, green plants take in carbon dioxide and water and convert them into carbohydrates and oxygen in the presence of light and chlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant.","6.2 NUTRITION When we walk or ride a bicycle, we are using up energy. Even when we are not doing any apparent activity, energy is needed to maintain a state of order in our body. We also need materials from outside in order to grow, develop, synthesise protein and other substances needed in the body. This source of energy and materials is the food we eat. How do living things get their food? The general requirement for energy and materials is common in all organisms, but it is fulfilled in different ways. Some organisms use simple food material obtained from inorganic sources in the form of carbon dioxide and water. These organisms, the autotrophs, include green plants and some bacteria. Other organisms utilise complex substances. These complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones before they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body. To achieve this, organisms use bio-catalysts called enzymes. Thus, the heterotrophs survival depends directly or indirectly on autotrophs. Heterotrophic organisms include animals and fungi.
 6.2.1 Autotrophic Nutrition Carbon and energy requirements of the autotrophic organism are fulfilled by photosynthesis. It is the process by which autotrophs take in substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms of energy. This material is taken in the form of carbon dioxide and water which is converted into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant. We will study how this takes place in the next section. The carbohydrates which are not used immediately are stored in the form of starch, which serves as the internal energy reserve to be used as and when required by the plant. A somewhat similar situation is seen in us where some of the energy derived from the food we eat is stored in our body in the form of glycogen.

(i) What prevents the entry of food into trachea while swallowing ? (ii) Why rate of breathing is faster in aquatic animals as compared to terrestrial animals ?,(i) Epiglottis : It covers the opening of wind pipe during swallowing. (ii) Because the amount of dissolved O2 in water is less as compared to the air in atmosphere.,"Since the amount of dissolved oxygen is fairly low compared to the amount of oxygen in the air, the rate of breathing in aquatic organisms is much faster than that seen in terrestrial organisms. Fishes take in water through their mouths and force it past the gills where the dissolved oxygen is taken up by blood. Terrestrial organisms use the oxygen in the atmosphere for respiration. This oxygen is absorbed by different organs in different animals. All these organs have a structure that increases the surface area which is in contact with the oxygen-rich atmosphere. Since the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide has to take place across this surface, this surface is very fine and delicate. In order to protect this surface, it is usually placed within the body, so there have to be passages that will take air to this area. In addition, there is a mechanism for moving the air in and out of this area where the oxygen is absorbed. In human beings (Fig. 6.9), air is taken into the body through the nostrils. The air passing through the nostrils is filtered by fine hairs that line the passage. The passage is also lined with mucus which helps in this process. From here, the air passes through the throat and into the lungs. Rings of cartilage are present in the throat. These ensure that the air-passage does not collapse.
 "
How are the alveoli designed to maximise the exchange of gases ?  3,"(i) The alveoli are thin walled and richly supplied with a network of blood vessels to facilitate exchange of gases between blood and the air filled in alveoli. (ii) Alveoli have balloon like structure. Thus, provide maximum surface for exchange of gases.","Within the lungs, the passage divides into smaller and smaller tubes which finally terminate in balloon-like structures which are called alveoli (singular–alveolus). The alveoli provide a surface where the exchange of gases can take place. The walls of the alveoli contain an extensive network of blood-vessels. As we have seen in earlier years, when we breathe in, we lift our ribs and flatten our diaphragm, and the chest cavity becomes larger as a result. Because of this, air is sucked into the lungs and fills the expanded alveoli. The blood brings carbon dioxide from the rest of the body for release into the alveoli, and the oxygen in the alveolar air is taken up by blood in the alveolar blood vessels to be transported to all the cells in the body. During the breathing cycle, when air is taken in and let out, the lungs always contain a residual volume of air so that there is sufficient time for oxygen to be absorbed and for the carbon dioxide to be released. When the body size of animals is large, the diffusion pressure alone cannot take care of oxygen delivery to all parts of the body. Instead, respiratory pigments take up oxygen from the air in the lungs and carry it to tissues which are deficient in oxygen before releasing it. In human beings, the respiratory pigment is haemoglobin which has a very high affinity for oxygen. This pigment is present in the red blood corpuscles. Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than oxygen is and hence is mostly transported in the dissolved form in our blood.
 "
What constitutes one heart beat ? Is the pulse rate same as heart beat rate ?,"Heart beat is due to the rhythmic contraction and relaxation of heart muscles. One contraction (systole) and one relaxation (diastole) of heart constitute one heartbeat. The pulse rate is same as heart beat rate. The rhythmic contraction of the heart is felt in certain areas like the wrist in the form of pulsations, and this is called pulse rate.","Figure 6.10 Schematic sectional view of the human heart
 Our pump — the heart The heart is a muscular organ which is as big as our fist (Fig. 6.10). Because both oxygen and carbon dioxide have to be transported by the blood, the heart has different chambers to prevent the oxygen-rich blood from mixing with the blood containing carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide-rich blood has to reach the lungs for the carbon dioxide to be removed, and the oxygenated blood from the lungs has to be brought back to the heart. This oxygen-rich blood is then pumped to the rest of the body. We can follow this process step by step (Fig. 6.11). Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs comes to the thin-walled upper chamber of the heart on the left, the left atrium. The left atrium relaxes when it is collecting this blood. It then contracts, while the next chamber, the left ventricle, relaxes, so that the blood is transferred to it. When the muscular left ventricle contracts in its turn, the blood is pumped out to the body. De-oxygenated blood comes from the body to the upper chamber on the right, the right atrium, as it relaxes. As the right atrium contracts, the corresponding lower chamber, the right ventricle, dilates. This transfers blood to the right ventricle, which in turn pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation. Since ventricles have to pump blood into various organs, they have thicker muscular walls than the atria do. Valves ensure that blood does not flow backwards when the atria or ventricles contract.

 Oxygen enters the blood in the lungs The separation of the right side and the left side of the heart is useful to keep oxygenated and deoxygenated blood from mixing. Such separation allows a highly efficient supply of oxygen to the body. This is useful in animals that have high energy needs, such as birds and mammals, which constantly use energy to maintain their body temperature. In animals that do not use energy for this purpose, the body temperature depends on the temperature in the environment. Such animals, like amphibians or many reptiles have three-chambered hearts, and tolerate some mixing of the oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood streams. Fishes, on the other hand, have only two chambers to their hearts, and the blood is pumped Figure 6.11 to the gills, is oxygenated there, and passes directly Schematic representation of transport and exchange to the rest of the body. Thus, blood goes only once of oxygen and carbon dioxide through the heart in the fish during one cycle of passage through the body. On the other hand, it goes through the heart twice during each cycle in other vertebrates. This is known as double circulation. Science
 Blood pressure The force that blood exerts against the wall of a vessel is called blood pressure. This pressure is much greater in arteries than in veins. The pressure of blood inside the artery during ventricular systole (contraction) is called systolic pressure and pressure in artery during ventricular diastole (relaxation) is called diastolic pressure. The normal systolic pressure is about 120 mm of Hg and diastolic pressure is 80 mm of Hg.

What is the need of four-chambered heart in mammals while fishes have only two-chambered heart ?,"Mammals need more energy to maintain their body temperature that’s why they have four chambered heart. In the mammal heart, the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood is not allowed to mix, and this is achieved by the separation of the heart into right side and left side. Such a separation of heart provides an efficient method of supplying oxygen to the body. Fish have two chambered heart and oxygenation of blood takes place in the gills and passes directly to the rest of the body.","Our pump — the heart The heart is a muscular organ which is as big as our fist (Fig. 6.10).

Thus, blood goes only once of oxygen and carbon dioxide through the heart in the fish during one cycle of passage through the body.

 Oxygen enters the blood in the lungs The separation of the right side and the left side of the heart is useful to keep oxygenated and deoxygenated blood from mixing. Such separation allows a highly efficient supply of oxygen to the body. This is useful in animals that have high energy needs, such as birds and mammals, which constantly use energy to maintain their body temperature. In animals that do not use energy for this purpose, the body temperature depends on the temperature in the environment. Such animals, like amphibians or many reptiles have three-chambered hearts, and tolerate some mixing of the oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood streams.

"During summer season we drink a lot of water in comparison to winter, yet we pass urine fewer times in summer than in winter. What is the reason behind this fact ?","During summer season, we lose a good amount of water through perspiration to keep our body temperature normal. While in winter, there is no perspiration. That is why, in summer season we drink a lot of water and pass urine fewer times. 3","Provided that the plant has an adequate supply of water, the water which is lost through the stomata is replaced by water from the xylem vessels in the leaf. In fact, evaporation of water molecules from the cells of a leaf creates a suction which pulls water from the xylem cells of roots. The loss of water in the form of vapour from the aerial parts of the plant is known as transpiration. Thus, transpiration helps in the absorption and upward movement of water and minerals dissolved in it from roots to the leaves. It also helps in temperature regulation. The effect of root pressure in transport of water is more important at night. During the day when the stomata are open, the transpiration pull becomes the major driving force in the movement Figure 6.12 of water in the xylem. Movement of water during transpiration in a tree Transport of food and other substances So far we have discussed the transport of water and minerals in plants. Now let us consider how the products of metabolic processes, particularly photosynthesis, are moved from leaves, where they are formed, to other parts of the plant. This transport of soluble products of photosynthesis is called translocation and it occurs in the part of the vascular tissue known as phloem. Besides the products of photosynthesis, the phloem transports amino acids and other substances. These substances are especially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and to growing organs. The translocation of food and other substances takes place in the sieve tubes with the help of adjacent companion cells both in upward and downward directions. Unlike transport in xylem which can be largely explained by simple physical forces, the translocation in phloem is achieved by utilising

Do the freshwater animals reabsorb water through their excretory system like marine animals ? Justify your answer.,"The freshwater animals do not reabsorb water through their excretory system because in case of fresh water animals, large amount of water is taken up through their skin and mouth. The water content of the body is maintained by getting rid of excess water through excretory system. Marine animals need to conserve water that’s why water is reabsorbed by excretory system in marine animals.","Since the amount of dissolved oxygen is fairly low compared to the amount of oxygen in the air, the rate of breathing in aquatic organisms is much faster than that seen in terrestrial organisms. Fishes take in water through their mouths and force it past the gills where the dissolved oxygen is taken up by blood. Terrestrial organisms use the oxygen in the atmosphere for respiration. This oxygen is absorbed by different organs in different animals. All these organs have a structure that increases the surface area which is in contact with the oxygen-rich atmosphere. Since the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide has to take place across this surface, this surface is very fine and delicate. In order to protect this surface, it is usually placed within the body, so there have to be passages that will take air to this area. In addition, there is a mechanism for moving the air in and out of this area where the oxygen is absorbed. In human beings (Fig. 6.9), air is taken into the body through the nostrils. The air passing through the nostrils is filtered by fine hairs that line the passage. The passage is also lined with mucus which helps in this process. From here, the air passes through the throat and into the lungs. Rings of cartilage are present in the throat. These ensure that the air-passage does not collapse.
 "
The inner lining of the small intestine contains numerous villi. Are villi helpful in food absorption ? Give the reason behind your answer.,"The major part of the process of digestion of food takes place in the small intestine. The digested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner lining of the small intestine contains numerous finger like projections called villi. The villi increase the surface area for absorption. Each villus is covered by a single layer of epithelium and contains blood vessels and lymph vessel. The food diffuses through the epithelium into the blood vessels. Glucose, amino acids, minerals and vitamins are absorbed in the blood vessels of the villi; the fatty acids and glycerol are absorbed by lacteals, which are carried to lymph vessels to the point where the lymph vessels empty into the blood stream.","6.2.3 How do Organisms obtain their Nutrition? Since the food and the way it is obtained differ, the digestive system is different in various organisms. In single-celled organisms, the food may be taken in by the entire surface. But as the complexity of the organism increases, different parts become specialised to perform different functions. For example, Amoeba takes in food using temporary finger-like extensions of the cell surface which fuse over the food particle forming a food-vacuole (Fig. 6.5). Inside the foodvacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones which then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested material is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In Paramoecium, which is also a unicellular organism, the cell has a definite shape and food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved to this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface of the cell. Figure 6.5 Nutrition in Amoeba
 6.2.4 Nutrition in Human Beings The alimentary canal is basically a long tube extending from the mouth to the anus. In Fig. 6.6, we can see that the tube has different parts. Various regions are specialised to perform different functions. What happens to the food once it enters our body? We shall discuss this process here.
 We eat various types of food which has to pass through the same digestive tract. Naturally the food has to be processed to generate particles which are small and of the same texture. This is achieved by crushing the food with our teeth. Since the lining of the canal is soft, the food is also wetted to make its passage smooth. When we eat something we like, our mouth ‘waters’. This is actually not only water, but a fluid called saliva secreted by the salivary glands. Another aspect of the food we ingest is its complex nature. If it is to be absorbed from the alimentary canal, it has to be broken into smaller molecules. This is done with the help of biological catalysts called enzymes. The saliva contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that breaks down starch which is a complex molecule to give simple sugar. The food is mixed thoroughly with saliva and moved around the mouth while chewing by the muscular tongue. It is necessary to move the food in a regulated manner along the digestive tube so that it can be processed properly in each part. The lining of canal has muscles that contract rhythmically in order to push the food forward. These peristaltic movements occur all along the gut. From the mouth, the food is taken to the stomach through the food-pipe or oesophagus. The stomach is a large organ which expands when food enters it. The muscular walls of the stomach help in mixing the food Figure 6.6 Human alimentary canal thoroughly with more digestive juices. The digestion in stomach is taken care of by the gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach. These release hydrochloric acid, a protein digesting enzyme called pepsin, and mucus. The hydrochloric acid creates an acidic medium which facilitates the action of the enzyme pepsin. What other function do you think is served by the acid? The mucus protects the inner lining of the stomach from the action of the acid under normal conditions. We

Why did Mendel choose pea plant for his experiments.  3,Mendel selected peas for his experiments because : (i) Many varieties are available with observable contrasting characteristic or trait. (ii) Peas are normally self pollinated and the flower structure is suitable for cross-pollination. 1½+1½,"Gregor Johann Mendel (1822–1884) Mendel was educated in a monastery and went on to study science and mathematics at the University of Vienna. Failure in the examinations for a teaching certificate did not suppress his zeal for scientific quest. He went back to his monastery and started growing peas. Many others had studied the inheritance of traits in peas and other organisms earlier, but Mendel blended his knowledge of science and mathematics and was the first one to keep count of individuals exhibiting a particular trait in each generation. This helped him to arrive at the laws of inheritance.
 Figure 9.3 Inheritance of traits over two generations
 Mendel used a number of contrasting visible characters of garden peas – round/wrinkled seeds, tall/short plants, white/violet flowers and so on. He took pea plants with different characteristics – a tall plant and a short plant, produced progeny by crossing them, and calculated the percentages of tall or short progeny. In the first place, there were no halfway characteristics in this firstgeneration, or F1 progeny – no ‘medium-height’ plants. All plants were tall. This meant that only one of the parental traits was seen, not some mixture of the two. So the next question was, were the tall plants in the F1 generation exactly the same as the tall plants of the parent generation? Mendelian experiments test this by getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall plants to reproduce by self-pollination. The progeny of the parental plants are, of course, all tall. However, the second-generation, or F2, progeny of the F1 tall plants are not all tall. Instead, one quarter of them are short. This indicates that both the tallness and shortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants, but only the tallness trait was expressed. This led Mendel to propose that two copies of factor (now called genes) controlling traits are present in sexually reproducing organism. These two may be identical, or may be different, depending on the parentage. A pattern of inheritance can be worked out with this assumption, as shown in Fig. 9.3.

Describe briefly four ways in which individuals with a particular trait may increase in a population.,The four ways in which individuals with a particular trait may increase in a population are as follows : (i) Sexual reproduction results into variations. (ii) The individuals with special traits survive the attack of their predators and multiply while the other will perish. (iii) Genetic drift provides diversity without any adaptations. (iv) Variations in the species may lead to increased survival of the individuals.,"What are the different ways in which individuals with a particular trait may increase in a population?

Explain with an example how traits get expressed ?,"DNA is the source of information for making proteins in the cell. The section of DNA is called gene. For example, the height of a plant depends on the hormone. The amount of hormone depends on the process of its formation. A protein is important for this process. If this protein works efficiently a lot of hormone will be made. If the gene responsible for that protein has an alteration, this will make the protein less efficient. The amount of hormone will be less and the plant will be short. Thus, traits get expressed.","F1 How does the mechanism of heredity work? Cellular DNA is Rr Yy the information source for making proteins in the cell. A section (round, yellow) of DNA that provides information for one protein is called the x gene for that protein. How do proteins control the Rr Yy Rr Yy characteristics that we are discussing here? Let us take the F1 F1 example of tallness as a characteristic. We know that plants have hormones that can trigger growth. Plant height can thus ry Ry RY rY depend on the amount of a particular plant hormone. The F2 amount of the plant hormone made will depend on the RY efficiency of the process for making it. Consider now an enzyme RRYY RRYy RrYY RrYy that is important for this process. If this enzyme works Ry efficiently, a lot of hormone will be made, and the plant will be RRYy RRyy RrYy Rryy tall. If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration that makes rY the enzyme less efficient, the amount of hormone will be less, RrYY RrYy rrYY rrYy and the plant will be short. Thus, genes control characteristics, ry or traits.

If progeny plants inherited a of two separate traits, single whole gene set from each parent, then the experiment explained shape and colour of seeds in Fig. 9.5 cannot work. This is because the two characteristics ‘R’ and ‘y’ would then be linked to each other and cannot be independently

Define genetics. What is the contribution of Mendel in this branch of biology ?,"The science of heredity and variation is called genetics. Mendel conducted breeding experiments in a garden pea plant (Pisum sativum) with two different contrasting characters. He found that only one character appeared in first generation but both the characters reappeared in the subsequent generation. On the basis of results of his experiments, he put forward the various principles of inheritance. He also suggested that each character of pea plant is controlled by ‘factor’.","Gregor Johann Mendel (1822–1884) Mendel was educated in a monastery and went on to study science and mathematics at the University of Vienna.

State and describe in brief any three main factors responsible for the rise of a new species.,"Factors responsible for rise of a new species are : (i) Genetic drift : Over generation, genetic drift may accumulate which lead to the formation of a new species.

What is the significance of homologous and analogous organs in the process of evolution ? 5,"The significance of homologous and analogous organs in the process of evolution are as follows : (i) The existence of homologous anatomical structures implies a common evolutionary origin of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals from same ancient fish ancestor. (ii) The homologous structures seen in successive generations indicate relationship and their possessors are the diverse descendants of common ancestry. They point to evolution and divergence from the ancestral type. (iii) Analogous organs have arisen in the evolutionary process through adaptation of different organisms to a similar mode of life.","Figure 9.8 Homologous organs
 When we try to follow evolutionary relationships, how do we identify characteristics as common? These characteristics in different organisms would be similar because they are inherited from a common ancestor. As an example, consider the fact that mammals have four limbs, as do birds, reptiles and amphibians (Fig. 9.8). The basic structure of the limbs is similar though it has been modified to perform different functions in various vertebrates. Such a homologous characteristic helps to identify an evolutionary relationship between apparently different species. However, all similarities simply in organ shape are not necessarily because of common ancestry. What would we think about the wings of

How do you call in short the Lamarck’s theory of evolution ? Who disapproved it initially and how ?,"Lamarck theory is called theory of inheritance of acquired characters. It says that the organisms are exposed to new needs due to a change in the environment. They acquire same characters during their lifetime to adapt themselves to the new needs. These characters are passed on to the next generation. For example, the long neck of giraffe is due to need to catch the leaves of long tress. A. Weismann rejected the theory of Lamarck, stating that adaptations based in the somatic cells cannot be inherited.","9.3.2 Acquired and Inherited Traits We discussed the idea that the germ cells of sexually reproducing populations are made in specialised reproductive tissue. If the weight of the beetle is reduced because of starvation, that will not change the DNA of the germ cells. Therefore, low weight is not a trait that can be inherited by the progeny of a starving beetle. Therefore, even if some generations of beetles are low in weight because of starvation, that is not an example of evolution, since the change is not inherited over generations. Change in non-reproductive tissues cannot be passed on to the DNA of the germ cells. Therefore the experiences of an individual during its lifetime cannot be passed on to its progeny, and cannot direct evolution. Consider another example of how an individual cannot pass on to its progeny the experiences of its lifetime. If we breed a group of mice, all their progeny will have tails, as expected. Now, if the tails of these mice are removed by surgery in each generation, do these tailless mice have tailless progeny? The answer is no, and it makes sense because removal of the tail cannot change the genes of the germ cells of the mice. Charles Robert Darwin (1809–1882) Charles Darwin set out on a voyage when he was 22 years old. The five-year voyage took him to South America and the islands off its coast. The studies that he conducted during this voyage were to change forever the way we look at the variety of life on earth. Interestingly, after he got back to England, he never left its shores again. He stayed at home and conducted various experiments that led him to formulate his hypothesis that evolution took place due to natural selection. He did not know the mechanism whereby variations arose in the species. He would have been enlightened by Mendel’s experiments, but these two gentlemen did not know of each other or their work! We often associate Darwin solely with the theory of evolution. But he was an accomplished naturalist, and one of the studies he conducted was to do with the role of earthworms in soil fertility. This is the reason why the ideas of heredity and genetics that we have discussed earlier are so essential for understanding evolution. Even Charles Darwin, who came up with the idea of evolution of species by natural selection in the nineteenth century, could not work out the mechanism. It is ironic that he could have done so if he had seen the significance of the experiments his Austrian contemporary, Gregor Mendel, was doing. But then, Mendel too did not notice Darwin’s work as relevant to his!

Skin colour used to be the commonest way of identifying these socalled races. Some were called yellow, some black, white or brown. A major question debated for a long time was, have these apparent groups evolved differently? Over recent years, the evidence has become very clear. The answer is that there is no biological basis to the notion of human races. All humans are a single species. Not only that, regardless of where we have lived for the past few thousand years, we all come from Africa. The earliest members of the human species, Homo sapiens, can be traced there. Our genetic footprints can be traced back to our African roots. A couple of hundred thousand years ago, some of our ancestors left Africa while others stayed on. While

Why do fire flies glow at night ? ,"Fire flies have a special kind of substances i.e., luciferin that undergoes oxidation (in the presence of air) in the presence of an enzyme. This reaction is accompanied by the emission of light. Therefore, fire flies glow at night.","Why do substances burn with or without a flame? Have you ever observed either a coal or a wood fire? If not, the next time you get a chance, take close note of what happens when the wood or coal starts to burn. You have seen above that a candle or the LPG in the gas stove burns with a flame. However, you will observe the coal or charcoal in an ‘angithi’ sometimes just glows red and gives out heat without a flame. This is because a flame is only produced when gaseous substances burn. When wood or charcoal is ignited, the volatile substances present vapourise and burn with a flame in the beginning. A luminous flame is seen when the atoms of the gaseous substance are heated and start to glow. The colour produced by each element is a characteristic property of that element. Try and heat a copper wire in the flame of a gas stove and observe its colour. You have seen that incomplete combustion gives soot which is carbon. On this basis, what will you attribute the yellow colour of a candle flame to?

 We have discussed nutrition in organisms in the last section. The food material taken in during the process of nutrition is used in cells to provide energy for various life processes. Diverse organisms do this in different ways – some use oxygen to break-down glucose completely into carbon dioxide and water, some use other pathways that do not involve oxygen (Fig. 6.8). In all cases, the first step is the break-down of glucose, a six-carbon molecule, into a three-carbon molecule called pyruvate. This process takes place in the cytoplasm. Further, the pyruvate may be converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process takes place in yeast during fermentation. Since this process takes place in the absence of air (oxygen), it is called anaerobic respiration. Breakdown of pyruvate using oxygen takes place in the mitochondria. This

Can two magnetic lines of force intersect each other ? Give reasons in support of your answer. 3 ,"No, two magnetic lines of force never intersect each other. If two magnetic lines of force intersect each other then at the point of intersection there will be two different directions of magnetic field which is not possible.","Magnetic field is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude. The direction of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which a north pole of the compass needle moves inside it. Therefore it is taken by convention that the field lines emerge from north pole and merge at the south pole (note the arrows marked on the field lines in Fig. 13.4). Inside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its north pole. Thus the magnetic field lines are closed curves. The relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of closeness of the field lines. The field is stronger, that is, the force acting on the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are crowded (see Fig. 13.4). No two field-lines are found to cross each other. If they did, it would mean that at the point of intersection, the compass needle would point towards two directions, which is not possible.
 A magnetic field exists in the region surrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected.
 n
 Field lines are used to represent a magnetic field. A field line is the path along which a hypothetical free north pole would tend to move. The direction of the magnetic field at a point is given by the direction that a north pole placed at that point would take. Field lines are shown closer together where the magnetic field is greater.

The deflection of the compass needle increases as it is moved towards the pole of a bar magnet. Why ? 3,"The magnetic field due to a bar magnet is highest near its two poles. Therefore, the force exerted by the bar magnet on the compass needle is larger in such a region. That is why the deflection of the compass needle increases when it is moved towards the pole of a bar magnet.","Why does a compass needle get deflected when brought near a bar magnet?

"Sita wants to determine the direction of a force, experienced by a straight current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field which is perpendicular to it. Which rule will she apply to determine it ?","Sita will apply Fleming’s left hand rule. According to Fleming’s left hand rule, when the forefinger, the central finger and the thumb of the left hand are stretched mutually perpendicular to each other and if the forefinger points in the direction of the magnetic field, the central finger in the direction of current, then the thumb points in the direction of force on the conductor.","the direction of force acting on the current-carrying rod gets reversed. It shows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the direction of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments have shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the magnitude of the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles to the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a simple rule to find the direction of the force on the conductor. In Activity 13.7, we considered the direction of the current and that of the magnetic field perpendicular to each other and found that the force is perpendicular to both of them. The three directions can be illustrated through a simple rule, called Fleming’s left-hand rule. According to this rule, stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of your left hand such that they are mutually perpendicular (Fig. 13.13). If the first finger points in the direction of magnetic field and the second finger in the direction of current, then the Figure 13.13 thumb will point in the direction of motion or Fleming’s left-hand rule the force acting on the conductor. Devices that use current-carrying conductors and magnetic fields include electric motor, electric generator, loudspeakers, microphones and measuring instruments. In the next few sections we shall study about electric motors and generators. Example 13.2 An electron enters a magnetic field at right angles to it, as shown in Fig. 13.14.

(ii) Held at rest inside the coil. (iii) Name the phenomenon responsible for the above observation.,(i) Momentary deflection in the needle of galvanometer say to the right. (ii) Deflection of the galvanometer drops to zero. (iii) Electromagnetic Induction.,"There is a momentary deflection in the needle of the galvanometer, say to the right. This indicates the presence of a current in the coil AB. The deflection becomes zero the moment the motion of the magnet stops. Now withdraw the north pole of the magnet away from the coil. Now the galvanometer is deflected toward the left, showing that the current is now set up in the direction opposite to the first. Place the magnet stationary at a point near to the coil, keeping its north pole towards the end B of the coil. We see that the galvanometer needle deflects toward the right when the coil is moved towards the north pole of the magnet. Similarly the needle moves toward left when the coil is moved away. When the coil is kept stationary with respect to the magnet, the deflection of the galvanometer drops to zero. What do you conclude from this activity?

 Figure 13.16 Moving a magnet towards a coil sets up a current in the coil circuit, as indicated by deflection in the galvanometer needle.
 A galvanometer is an instrument that can detect the presence of a current in a circuit. The pointer remains at zero (the centre of the scale) for zero current flowing through it. It can deflect either to the left or to the right of the zero mark depending on the direction of current. You can also check that if you had moved south pole of the magnet towards the end B of the coil, the deflections in the galvanometer would just be opposite to the previous case. When the coil and the magnet are both stationary, there is no deflection in the galvanometer. It is, thus, clear from this activity that motion of a magnet with respect to the coil produces an induced potential difference, which sets up an induced electric current in the circuit.

Where do we connect a fuse; with a live wire or with a neutral wire ? What happens if the fuse wire is connected to neutral wire ?,"Fuse is always connected to live wire. If fuse wire is connected to neutral wire instead of live wire then even when the fuse burns out, the appliance remains connected to the live wire and the current supply will not be disrupted due to over loading. 3","Figure 13.20 gives a schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuits. In each separate circuit, different appliances can be connected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a separate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order that each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected parallel to each other. Electric fuse is an important component of all domestic circuits. We have already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous chapter (see Section 12.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the appliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur when the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This occurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the appliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly increases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse prevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage by stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating that takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit. Overloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply voltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many appliances to a single socket.
 In our houses we receive AC electric power of 220 V with a frequency of 50 Hz. One of the wires in this supply is with red insulation, called live wire. The other one is of black insulation, which is a neutral wire. The potential difference between the two is 220 V. The third is the earth wire that has green insulation and this is connected to a metallic body deep inside earth. It is used as a safety measure to ensure that any leakage of current to a metallic body does not give any severe shock to a user.

Is it possible to change the polarity of an electromagnet ? Give any two uses of electromagnets.,"Yes, we can change the polarity of an electromagnet by reversing the direction of current. Uses of electromagnets : (i) In electric bells (ii) For separating magnetic substances such as iron and other metallic substances from metallic scrap.","Take a long straight copper wire, two or three cells of 1.5 V each, and a plug key. Connect all of them in series as shown in Fig. 13.5 (a). Place the straight wire parallel to and over a compass needle. Plug the key in the circuit. Observe the direction of deflection of the north pole of the needle. If the current flows from north to south, as shown in Fig. 13.5 (a), the north pole of the compass needle would move towards the east. Replace the cell connections in the circuit as shown in Fig. 13.5 (b). This would result in the change of the direction of current through the copper wire, that is, from south to north. Observe the change in the direction of deflection of the needle. You will see that now the needle moves in opposite direction, that is, towards the west [Fig. 13.5 (b)]. It means that the direction of magnetic field produced by the electric current is also reversed.

(a) A large number of free electrons are present in metals. Why is there no current in the absence of electric field across it ? (b) V-I graphs for parallel and series combination of two metallic resistors are shown in figure. Which graph represents parallel combination ? Justify your answer.,"(a) In the absence of an electric field, the motion of the electrons in a metal is random. There is no net flow of charge across any section of the conductor. So no current flows in the metal. (b) As R = , clearly, slope of V-I graph gives resistance R. As graph B has a greater slope than A, so graph B represent series combination (higher resistance) and graph A represents parallel combination (lower resistance).","In this Activity, you will find that approximately the same value for V/I is obtained in each case. Thus the V–I graph is a straight line that passes through the origin of the graph, as shown in Fig. 12.3. Thus, V/I is a constant ratio. In 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1787–1854) found out the relationship between the current I, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference across its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the ends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided its temperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In other words – V∝I (12.4) or V/I = constant = R or V = IR (12.5) In Eq. (12.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire at a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the property of a conductor to resist the flow of charges

How is the supply of electricity maintained in a windmill when there is no wind ? In a solar panel when there is no sun ?,"In both the cases, the electricity generated is stored in a battery. This battery provides electricity when there is no wind in the case of a windmill and no sun in the case of a solar panel.","Wind Energy We saw in Class IX how unequal heating of the landmass and water bodies by solar radiation generates air movement and causes winds to blow. This kinetic energy of the wind can be used to do work. This energy was harnessed by windmills in the past to do mechanical work. For example, in a water-lifting pump, the rotatory motion of windmill is utilised to lift water from a well. Today, wind energy is also used to generate electricity. A windmill essentially consists of a structure similar to a large electric fan that is erected at some height on a rigid support (Fig. 14.5). To generate electricity, the rotatory motion of the windmill is used to turn the turbine of the electric generator. The output of a single windmill is quite small and cannot be used for commercial purposes. Therefore, a number of windmills are erected over a large area, which is known as wind energy farm.

 Suggest some approaches towards the conservation of forests.
 In ancient times, wood was the most common source of heat energy. The energy of flowing water and wind was also used for limited activities. Can you think of some of these uses? The exploitation of coal as a source of energy made the industrial revolution possible. Increasing industrialisation has led to a better quality of life all over the world. It has also caused the global demand for energy to grow at a tremendous rate. The growing demand for energy was largely met by the fossil fuels – coal and petroleum. Our technologies were also developed for using these energy sources. But these fuels were formed over millions of years ago and there are only limited reserves. The fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy, so we need to conserve them. If we were to continue consuming these sources at such alarming rates, we would soon run out of energy! In order to avoid this, alternate sources of energy were explored. But we continue to be largely dependent on fossil fuels for most of our energy requirements (Fig. 14.1). Burning fossil fuels has other disadvantages too. We learnt in Class IX about the air pollution caused by burning of coal or petroleum products. The oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur that are released on burning fossil fuels are acidic oxides. These lead to acid rain which affects our water and soil resources. In addition to the problem of air pollution, recall the green-house effect of gases like carbon dioxide.

The pollution caused by burning fossil fuels can be somewhat reduced by increasing the efficiency of the combustion process and using various techniques to reduce the escape of harmful gases and ashes into the surroundings. Besides being used directly for various purposes – in gas stoves and vehicles, do you know fossil fuels are the major fuels used for generating electricity? Let us produce some electricity at our own small plant in the class and see what goes into producing our favourite form of energy.

Which is a better fuel : biogas or animal dung-cakes ? Give reasons in support of your answer.,"Biogas is a better fuel than animal dung-cakes. This is because of the following reasons : (i) Biogas burns without smoke, whereas the burning of animal dung-cakes produces a lot of smoke. (ii) Animal dung-cakes leave residue like ash, whereas biogas leaves no residue. (iii) The calorific value of biogas is much higher than that of animal dung-cakes.","14.2.4 Improvements in the Technology for using Conventional Sources of Energy Bio-Mass We mentioned earlier that wood has been used as a fuel for a long time. If we can ensure that enough trees are planted, a continuous supply of fire-wood can be assured. You must also be familiar with the use of cow-dung cakes as a fuel. Given the large live-stock population in India, this can also assure us a steady source of fuel. Since these fuels are plant and animal products, the source of these fuels is said to be bio-mass. These fuels, however, do not produce much heat on burning and a lot of smoke is given out when they are burnt. Therefore, technological inputs to improve the efficiency of these fuels are necessary. When wood is burnt in a limited supply of oxygen, water and volatile materials present in it get removed and charcoal is left behind as the residue. Charcoal burns without flames, is comparatively smokeless and has a higher heat generation efficiency. Similarly, cow-dung, various plant materials like the residue after harvesting the crops, vegetable waste and sewage are decomposed in the absence of oxygen to give bio-gas. Since the starting material is mainly cow-dung, it is popularly known as ‘gobar-gas’. Bio-gas is produced in a plant as shown in Fig. 14.4.

Two thin lenses of power + 3.5 D and –2.5D are placed in contact.

Focal length of combination cm = 100 cm 		Focal length (f) = 100 cm","The SI unit of power of a lens is ‘dioptre’. It is denoted by the letter D. If f is expressed in metres, then, power is expressed in dioptres. Thus, 1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre. 1D = 1m–1. You may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of a concave lens is negative. Opticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers. Let us say the lens prescribed has power equal to + 2.0 D. This means the lens prescribed is convex. The focal length of the lens is + 0.50 m. Similarly, a lens of power – 2.5 D has a focal length of – 0.40 m. The lens is concave.
 More to Know!
 Many optical instruments consist of a number of lenses. They are combined to increase the magnification and sharpness of the image. The net power (P ) of the lenses placed in contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers P1, P2, P3, … as P = P1 + P2 + P3 + … The use of powers, instead of focal lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for opticians. During eye-testing, an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lenses of known power, in contact, inside the testing spectacles’ frame. The optician calculates the power of the lens required by simple algebraic addition. For example, a combination of two lenses of power + 2.0 D and + 0.25 D is equivalent to a single lens of power + 2.25 D. The simple additive property of the powers of lenses can be used to design lens systems to minimise certain defects in images produced by a single lens. Such a lens system, consisting of several lenses, in contact, is commonly used in the design of lenses of camera, microscopes and telescopes.

 The reproductive parts of angiosperms are located in the flower. You have already studied the different parts of a flower – sepals, petals, stamens and pistil. Stamens and pistil are the reproductive parts of a flower which contain the germ-cells. What possible functions could the petals and sepals serve? The flower may be unisexual (papaya, watermelon) when it contains either stamens or pistil or bisexual (Hibiscus, mustard) when it contains both stamens and pistil. Stamen is the male reproductive part and it produces pollen grains that are yellowish in colour. You must have seen this yellowish powder that often sticks to our hands if we touch the stamen of a flower. Pistil is present in the centre of a flower and is the female reproductive part. It is made of three parts.

The number of chromosomes in the Zygote is,"reproduction incorporates such a process of combining DNA from two different individuals during reproduction. But this creates a major difficulty. If each new generation is to be the combination of the DNA copies from two pre-existing individuals, then each new generation will end up having twice the amount of DNA that the previous generation had. This is likely to mess up the control of the cellular apparatus by the DNA. How many ways can we think of for solving this difficulty? We have seen earlier that as organisms become more complex, the specialisation of tissue increases. One solution that many multi-cellular organisms have found for the problem mentioned above is to have special lineages of cells in specialised organs in which only half the number of chromosomes and half the amount of DNA as compared to the nonreproductive body cells. This is achieved by a process of cell division called meiosis. Thus, when these germ-cells from two individuals combine during sexual reproduction to form a new individual, it results in reestablishment of the number of chromosomes and the DNA content in the new generation. If the zygote is to grow and develop into an organism which has highly specialised tissues and organs, then it has to have sufficient stores of energy for doing this. In very simple organisms, it is seen that the two germ-cells are not very different from one another, or may even be similar. But as the body designs become more complex, the germ-cells also specialise. One germ-cell is large and contains the food-stores while the other is smaller and likely to be motile. Conventionally, the motile germcell is called the male gamete and the germ-cell containing the stored food is called the female gamete. We shall see in the next few sections how the need to create these two different types of gametes give rise to differences in the male and female reproductive organs and, in some cases, differences in the bodies of the male and female organisms.

Why do harmful chemicals concentrate as we go up in a food chain ?  3,"Harmful chemical concentrate in the trophic levels of food by the process of biological concentration or bio-magnification.

This is the reason why our food grains such as wheat and rice, vegetables and fruits, and even meat, contain varying amounts of pesticide residues. They cannot always be removed by washing or other means.

"With the knowledge of energy transfer in the food chain, man can place himself at an advantageous position in the food chain. Explain.","When man places himself close to the producers, he gets more calories. Lower the distance from producer level, lesser the amount of calories available. This is due to the fact that at every trophic level 90 percent of energy is lost to the environment. e.g., (i) Two step food chain Producers 1000J. → Man (ii) Three step food chain J heat → Goat 900 → Man Producers 10,000 J. 1000 J.","In Activity 15.4 we have formed a series of organisms feeding on one another. This series or organisms taking part at various biotic levels form a food chain (Fig. 15.1). Each step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level. The autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level. They fix up the solar energy and make it available for heterotrophs or the consumers. The herbivores or the primary consumers come at the second, small carnivores or the secondary consumers at the third and larger carnivores or the tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level (Fig. 15.2). We know that the food we eat acts as a fuel to provide us energy to do work. Thus the interactions among various components of the environment involves flow of energy from one component of the system to another. As we have studied, the autotrophs capture the energy present in sunlight and convert it into chemical energy. This energy supports all the activities of the living world. From autotrophs, the energy goes to the heterotrophs and decomposers. However, as we saw in the previous Chapter on ‘Sources of Energy’, when one form of energy is changed to another, some energy is lost to the environment in forms which cannot be used again. The flow of energy between various components of the environment has been extensively studied and it has been found that – The green plants in a terrestrial ecosystem capture about 1% of the energy of sunlight that falls on their leaves and convert it into food energy. When green plants are eaten by primary consumers, a great deal of energy is lost as heat to the environment, some amount goes into digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth and reproduction. An average of 10% of the food eaten is turned into its own body and made available for the next level of consumers. Therefore, 10% can be taken as the average value for the amount of organic matter that is present at each step and reaches the next level of consumers. Since so little energy is available for the next level of consumers, food chains generally consist of only three or four steps. The loss of energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy remains after four trophic levels. There are generally a greater number of individuals at the lower trophic levels of an ecosystem, the greatest number is of the producers. The length and complexity of food chains vary greatly. Each organism is generally eaten by two or more other kinds of organisms which in turn are eaten by several other organisms. So instead of a straight line food chain, the relationship can be shown as a series of branching lines called a food web (Fig. 15.3).
 The producers make the energy from sunlight available to the rest of the ecosystem.

 There is a loss of energy as we go from one trophic level to the next, this limits the number of trophic levels in a food-chain.

Why are green plants called producers ? ,Green plants are also called producers because only they can synthesize organic food from inorganic raw materials with the help of solar energy in the process of photosynthesis.

Why are bacteria and fungi called decomposers ?3,"Most of the bacteria and fungi are saprophytes. They obtain their nourishment from organic remains. For this they secrete digestive enzymes over the remains. The remains are converted into soluble absorbable form. This results in decomposition of organic matter. Therefore, bacteria and fungi are called decomposers.","We have seen in earlier classes that organisms can be grouped as producers, consumers and decomposers according to the manner in which they obtain their sustenance from the environment. Let us recall what we have learnt through the self sustaining ecosystem created by us above. Which organisms can make organic compounds like sugar and starch from inorganic substances using the radiant energy of the Sun in the presence of chlorophyll? All green plants and certain bacteria which can produce food by photosynthesis come under this category and are called the producers. Organisms depend on the producers either directly or indirectly for their sustenance? These organisms which consume the food produced, either directly from producers or indirectly by feeding on other consumers are the consumers. Consumers can be classed variously as herbivores, carnivores, omnivores and parasites. Can you give examples for each of these categories of consumers? n Imagine the situation where you do not clean the aquarium and some fish and plants have died. Have you ever thought what happens when an organism dies? The microorganisms, comprising bacteria and fungi, break-down the dead remains and waste products of organisms. These microorganisms are the decomposers as they break-down the complex organic substances into simple inorganic substances that go into the soil and are used up once more by the plants. What will happen to the garbage, and dead animals and plants in their absence? Will the natural replenishment of the soil take place, even if decomposers are not there?
 "
The use of pesticide DDT is discouraged since this chemical is found in human body. How does this chemical enter our body ?,"DDT enters through the food chain into the human body by the process called biomagnification or biological concentration. DDT is a non– biodegradable chemical that remains toxic in the soil for a long time, absorbed by the plants and thus, enters into the food chain. It gets accumulated at every successive trophic level reaching maximum quantity in the top–most trophic level.","and animals. This is one of the ways in which they enter the food chain.

Why are some substances biodegradable and some non-biodegradable ?,"Substance which can be degraded and disposed off naturally by saprophytic organisms or decomposers are called biodegradable, e.g., organic remains, garbage, sewage, livestock waste. Substances which cannot be degraded by saprophytes are known as non-biodegradable. They are mostly manmade articles like pesticides, plastic, polythene etc. Biodegradable articles are formed naturally in biosphere. Decomposer organisms feed on them by secreting digestive juices and absorbing the solubilised substances. Biogenetic nutrients are released in the process called mineralization.","We have seen in the chapter on ‘Life Processes’ that the food we eat is digested by various enzymes in our body. Have you ever wondered why the same enzyme does not break-down everything we eat? Enzymes are specific in their action, specific enzymes are needed for the break-down of a particular substance. That is why we will not get any energy if we try to eat coal! Because of this, many human-made materials like plastics will not be broken down by the action of bacteria or other saprophytes. These materials will be acted upon by physical processes like heat and pressure, but under the ambient conditions found in our environment, these persist for a long time. Substances that are broken down by biological processes are said to be biodegradable. How many of the substances you buried were biodegradable? Substances that are not broken down in this manner are said to be non-biodegradable. These substances may be inert and simply persist in the environment for a long time or may harm the various members of the eco-system.

This has increased the level of UV-B radiations reaching the earth by 15-20 %. These radiations are causing increased number of skin cancers, cataracts and reduced immunity in human beings. These causes increased incidence of blindness of animals, death of young ones, reduced photosynthesis, higher number of mutations and damage to articles.

A person with myopic eye cannot see object beyond 1.2 m distinctly. What should be the type of the corrective lens used to restore proper vision ?,"The far point for myopic eye is 1.2 m , u = – ∞, v =–1.2 m 		Using lens formula We get v u f P= = 0.83 D","Define 1 dioptre of power of a lens.
 "
Why is a normal eye not able to see clearly the objects placed close than 25 cm ?  3,"Focal length of the eye lens cannot be reduced below a certain limit. If an object is placed very close to the eye lens less than 25 cm, the ciliary muscles cannot contract further to make eye lens more thick. So, eye lens become unable to form sharp image on the retina. Therefore, we cannot see an object clearly if it is placed very close to the eye i.e. less than 25 cm. 3","11.1.1 Power of Accommodation The eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature can be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the curvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the muscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length increases. This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are looking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This increases the curvature of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker. Consequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases. This enables us to see nearby objects clearly. The ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called accommodation. However, the focal length of the eye lens cannot be decreased below a certain minimum limit. Try to read a printed page by holding it very close to your eyes. You may see the image being blurred or feel strain in the eye. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, you must hold it at about 25 cm from the eyes. The minimum distance, at which objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called the least distance of distinct vision. It is also called the near point of the eye. For a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about 25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is called the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a normal eye. You may note here a normal eye can see objects clearly that are between 25 cm and infinity. Sometimes, the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky and cloudy. This condition is called cataract. This causes partial or complete loss of vision. It is possible to restore vision through a cataract surgery.
 "
Why is a concave lens used to correct myopia or short- sightedness ?,A concave lens of suitable focal length diverges the parallel rays from the distant objects as if they are coming from the far point F of the myopic eye. This helps the eye lens to form a clear image at the retina.,"11.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION Sometimes, the eye may gradually lose its power of accommodation. In such conditions, the person cannot see the objects distinctly and comfortably. The vision becomes blurred due to the refractive defects of the eye. There are mainly three common refractive defects of vision. These are (i) myopia or near -sightedness, (ii) Hypermetropia or far sightedness, and (iii) Presbyopia. These defects can be corrected by the use of suitable spherical lenses. We discuss below these defects and their correction. (a) Myopia Myopia is also known as near-sightedness. A person with myopia can see nearby objects clearly but cannot see distant objects distinctly. A person with this defect has the far point nearer than infinity. Such a person may see clearly upto a distance of a few metres. In a myopic eye, the image of a distant object is formed in front of the retina [Fig. 11.2 (b)] and not at the retina itself. This defect may arise due to (i) excessive curvature of the eye lens, or (ii) elongation of the eyeball. This defect can be corrected by using a concave lens of suitable power. This is illustrated in Fig. 11.2 (c). A concave lens of suitable power will bring the image back on to Figure 11.2 the retina and thus the defect (a), (b) The myopic eye, and (c) correction for myopia with a is corrected. concave lens 189

The image appears blurred, in order to avoid this, the person prefers to remove his spectacles. 3","(b) Hypermetropia Hypermetropia is also known as far-sightedness. A person with hypermetropia can see distant objects clearly but cannot see nearby objects distinctly. The near point, for the person, is farther away from the normal near point (25 cm). Such a person has to keep a reading material much beyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable reading. This is because the light rays from a closeby object are focussed at a point behind the retina as shown in Fig. 11.3 (b). This defect arises either because (i) the focal length of the eye lens is too long, or (ii) the eyeball has become too small. This defect can be corrected by using a convex lens of appropriate power. This is illustrated in Fig. 11.3 (c). Eye-glasses with converging lenses provide the additional focussing power required for forming the image on the retina.

(ii) A hypermetropic person prefer to remove the spectacles while looking at the sky?,"(i) Myopic person does not need spectacles while reading a book as he has the near point at 25 cm. If such person reads the book with corrective lens (concave) he will have to keep the book at distance greater than 25 cm so that the image of book will be formed by the concave lens at 25 cm and moreover, the size of the book that appear to him is also smaller. Therefore, the person prefer to remove his spectacles while reading a book. (ii) Hypermetropic person does not need spectacles to see distant objects as he has the far point at infinity.

How does the colour of the scattered light depend on the size of the colloidal particles ?,"The colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering particles. Very fine particles having size less than the wavelength of visible light mainly scatter blue light of shorter wavelength of the visible spectrum. The particles of relatively larger size scatter light of longer wavelengths. The large particles such as raindrops, dust and ice particles scatter white light.","11.6 SCATTERING OF LIGHT
 spectacular phenomena in nature. The blue colour of the sky, colour of water in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset are some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous class, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles. The path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible. However, its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where the size of the particles is relatively larger.
 This activity demonstrates the scattering of light that helps you to understand the bluish colour of the sky and the reddish appearance of the Sun at the sunrise or the sunset. Light from the Sun near the horizon passes through thicker layers of air and larger distance in the earth’s atmosphere before reaching our eyes (Fig. 11.12). However, light from the Sun overhead would travel relatively shorter distance. At noon, the Sun appears white as only a little of the blue and violet Figure 11.12 Reddening of the Sun at sunrise and sunset colours are scattered. Near the horizon, most of the blue light and shorter wavelengths are scattered away by the particles. Therefore, the light that reaches our eyes is of longer wavelengths. This gives rise to the reddish appearance of the Sun.
 "
Dispersion is caused by refraction not by reflection. Why ?,"The reason is that for a given angle of incidence, the angle of reflection is same for all the wavelengths of white light while the angle of refraction is different for different wavelengths.","The following are the laws of refraction of light. (i) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane. (ii) The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for the given pair of media. This law is also known as Snell’s law of refraction. (This is true for angle 0 < i < 90o) If i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then, sin i = constant sin r

What is Tyndall effect ? What is its causes ? Name two phenomena observed in daily life which are based on Tyndall effect.,"Tyndall effect : When a beam of light is passed through a colloidal solution, placed in a dark room, the path of beam becomes illuminated when observed through a microscope placed perpendicular to the path of light. This effect is called Tyndall effect. Cause of Tyndall effect : The size of the colloidal particle is relatively larger than the solute particle of a true solution. The colloidal particles first absorb energy from the incident light and then scatter a part of this energy from their surfaces. Thus, Tyndall effect is due to scattering of light by the colloidal particles and the colloidal particles are seen to be moving as points of light moving against a dark background. Some daily phenomena based on Tyndall effect are as follows : (i) When a fine beam of sunlight enters a smoke filled room through a small hole, the smoke particles become visible due to the scattering of light. (ii) When sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense forest, the tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light and become visible.","spectacular phenomena in nature.

 11.6.1 Tyndall Effect The earth’s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles. These particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles of dust and molecules of air. When a beam of light strikes such fine particles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us, after being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of scattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect which you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a fine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole. Thus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can also be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense forest. Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light. The colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering particles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of larger size scatter light of longer wavelengths. If the size of the scattering particles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear white.

 e see a variety of objects in the world around us. However, we are unable to see anything in a dark room. On lighting up the room, things become visible. What makes things visible? During the day, the sunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it. This reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things. We are able to see through a transparent medium as light is transmitted through it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomena associated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling of stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium and so on. A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them. By observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may conclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a small source of light casts a sharp shadow of an opaque object points to this straight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.
 If an opaque object on the path of light becomes very small, light has a tendency to bend around it and not walk in a straight line – an effect known as the diffraction of light. Then the straight-line treatment of optics using rays fails. To explain phenomena such as diffraction, light is thought of as a wave, the details of which you will study in higher classes. Again, at the beginning of the 20th century, it became known that the wave theory of light often becomes inadequate for treatment of the interaction of light with matter, and light often behaves somewhat like a stream of particles. This confusion about the true nature of light continued for some years till a modern quantum theory of light emerged in which light is neither a ‘wave’ nor a ‘particle’ – the new theory reconciles the particle properties of light with the wave nature. In this Chapter, we shall study the phenomena of reflection and refraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light. These basic concepts will help us in the study of some of the optical phenomena in nature. We shall try to understand in this Chapter the reflection of light by spherical mirrors and refraction of light and their application in real life situations.

What will be the colour of sky in the absence of atmosphere ?,"In the absence of atmosphere, there will be no scattering of sunlight and the sky will appear dark. This is what astronauts actually observe at heights at 20 km above the earth where the atmosphere becomes thin.","11.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue? The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size smaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in scattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer wavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8 times greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter wavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters our eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been any scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark. The sky appears dark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not prominent at such heights. You might have observed that ‘danger’ signal lights are red in colour. Do you know why? The red is least scattered by fog or smoke. Therefore, it can be seen in the same colour at a distance.
 11.6.3 Colour of the Sun at Sunrise and Sunset Have you seen the sky and the Sun at sunset or sunrise? Have you wondered as to why the Sun and the surrounding sky appear red? Let us do an activity to understand the blue colour of the sky and the reddish appearance of the Sun at the sunrise or sunset.

What is meant by wildlife ? How is wildlife important for us ?,"Wildlife means all those naturally occurring animals, plants and their species which are not cultivated, domesticated and tamed. Wildlife is important for us because (i) They provide great aesthetic value for human beings. (ii) They help in maintaining ecological balance.","Lastly, we come to the nature and wildlife enthusiasts who are in no way dependent on the forests, but who may have considerable say in their management. The conservationists were initially taken up with large animals like lions, tigers, elephants and rhinoceros. They now recognise the need to preserve biodiversity as a whole. But shouldn’t we recognise people as forming part of the forest system? There have been enough instances of local people working traditionally for conservation of forests. For example, the case of Bishnois community living in western Rajasthan on the border of the Thar desert. Conservation of forest and wildlife has been a religious tenet for them. These nature-loving people have for centuries, been conserving the flora and fauna to the extent of sacrificing their lives to protect the environment. They are living with the basic philosophy that all living things have a right to survive and share all resources. The Government of India has recently instituted an ‘Amrita Devi Bishnoi National Award for Wildlife Conservation’ in the memory of Amrita Devi Bishnoi, who in 1731 sacrificed her life along with 363 others for the protection of ‘khejri’ trees in Khejrali village near Jodhpur in Rajasthan. Studies have shown that the prejudice against the traditional use of forest areas has no basis. Here is an example – the great Himalayan National Park contains, within its reserved area, alpine meadows which were grazed by sheep in summer. Nomadic shepherds drove their flock up from the valleys every summer. When this national park was formed, this practice was put to an end. Now it is seen that without the regular grazing by sheep the grass first grows very tall, and then falls over preventing fresh growth. Management of protected areas by keeping the local people out or by using force cannot possibly be successful in the long run. In any case, the damage caused to forests cannot be attributed to only the local people – one cannot turn a blind eye to the deforestation caused by industrial needs or development projects like building roads or dams. The damage caused in these reserves by tourists or the arrangements made for their convenience is also to be considered. We need to accept that human intervention has been very much a part of the forest landscape. What has to be managed in the nature and what may be the extent of this intervention? Forest resources ought to be used in a manner that is both environmentally and developmentally sound – in other words, while the environment is preserved, the benefits of the controlled exploitation go to the local people, a process in which decentralised economic growth and ecological conservation go hand in hand. The kind of economic and social development we want will ultimately determine whether the environment will be conserved or further destroyed. The environment must not be regarded as a pristine collection of plants and animals. It is a vast and complex entity that offers a range of natural resources for our use. We need to use these resources with due caution for our economic and social growth, and to meet our material aspirations.

List any four characteristics of a good fuel.,Characteristics of a good fuel are. (i) Higher calorific value (ii) Lesser pollution (iii) Sustainable for longer period (iv) Easily transportable,"Consider the various options we have when we choose a fuel for cooking our food. What are the criteria you would consider when trying to categorise something as a good fuel? Would your choice be different if you lived (a) in a forest? (b) in a remote mountain village or small island? (c) in New Delhi? (d) lived five centuries ago? How are the factors different in each case?
 After going through the two activities above, we can see that the particular source of energy, or fuel, we select for performing some work depends on many different factors. For example, while selecting a fuel, we would ask ourselves the following questions. (i) How much heat does it release on burning? (ii) Does it produce a lot of smoke? (iii) Is it easily available? Can you think of three more relevant questions to ask about a fuel? Given the range of fuels we have today, what are the factors which would limit our choices when it comes to a particular task like cooking our food? Would the fuel selected also depend on the work to be done? For example, would we choose one fuel for cooking and another for heating the room in winter? We could then say that a good source of energy would be one n which would do a large amount of work per unit volume or mass, n be easily accessible, n be easy to store and transport, and n perhaps most importantly, be economical.

What are three R’s used to save the environment? 5,"The three R’s are Reduce, Recycle and Reuse. Reduce : This means that we should use the resources judiciously and check their misuse. We should save electricity by switching off unnecessary lights and fans. We should save water by repairing leak taps. Recycle : This means that we should collect plastic, paper, glass and metal items and recycle this material to make required things instead of synthesising fresh plastic, paper, glass or metal. 2 Reuse : This is even better than recycling because it saves the energy which is spent at recycling a product. Things are used over and over again. For example, envelopes can be reused by reversing them.","This means that you use less. You save electricity by switching off unnecessary lights and fans. You save water by repairing leaky taps. Do not waste food. Can you think of other things that you can reduce the usage of ? This is actually even better than recycling because the process of recycling uses some energy. In the ‘reuse’ strategy, you simply use things again and again. Instead of throwing away used envelopes, you can reverse it and use it again. The plastic bottles in which you buy various food-items like jam or pickle can be used for storing things in the kitchen. What other items can we reuse?
 Recycle:
 This means that you collect plastic, paper, glass and metal items and recycle these materials to make required things instead of synthesising or extracting fresh plastic, paper, glass or metal. In order to recycle, we first need to segregate our wastes so that the material that can be recycled is not dumped along with other wastes. Does your village/town/ city have a mechanism in place for recycling these materials?

How does the water of Ganga get polluted ?,"The river Ganga runs from Gangotri in Himalayas to Ganga Sagar in the Bay of Bengal. On its course, it is being turned into a drain by more than a hundred towns and cities that pour their garbage and excreta into it. It also gets polluted by other human activities like bathing, washing of clothes etc.","Pollution of the Ganga The Ganga runs its course of over 2500 km from Gangotri in the Himalayas to Ganga Sagar in the Bay of Bengal. It is being turned into a drain by more than a hundred towns and cities in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal that pour their garbage and excreta into it. Largely untreated sewage is dumped into the Ganges every day. In addition, think of the pollution caused by other human activities like bathing, washing of clothes and immersion of ashes or unburnt corpses. And then, industries contribute chemical effluents to the Ganga’s pollution load and the toxicity kills fish in large sections of the river. Namami Gange Programme is an Integrated Conservation Mission approved as a Flagship Programme by the Union Government in June, 2014. It was launched to accomplish the twin objectives of effective abatement of pollution conservation and rejuvenation of River Ganga. The National Mission for Clean Ganga is the implementation wing set up in October, 2016. As you can see, there are some measurable factors which are used to quantify pollution or the quality of the water that we use for various activities. Some of the pollutants are harmful even when present in very small quantities and we require sophisticated equipment to measure them. But as we learnt in Chapter 2, the pH of water is something that can easily be checked using universal indicator.

“Economic growth and ecological conservation should go hand in hand“. Explain why ?,"Forest resources should be used in an environmentally and developmentally sound manner. The benefits of controlled exploitation of resources goes to the people and the environment is also preserved. If the exploitation is too high, economic and social development will be faster but the environment will further deteriorate. Therefore, we should use natural resources cautiously so that economic growth and ecological conservation go hand in hand.","Our resources like forests, wildlife, water, coal and petroleum need to be used in a sustainable manner. We can reduce pressure on the environment by sincerely applying the maxim of ‘Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose and Recycle’ in our lives. Management of forest resources has to take into account the interests of various stakeholders. The harnessing of water resources by building dams has social, economic and environmental implications. Alternatives to large dams exist. These are localespecific and may be developed so as to give local people control over their local resources. The fossil fuels, coal and petroleum, will ultimately be exhausted. Because of this and because their combustion pollutes our environment, we need to use these resources judiciously.

"This is an experimental set up, where pot number (a) is kept as control. When we drop the pot horizontally what will we observe if the experiment is done to detect the response of plant towards gravity ? (a) (b)","We will observe figure number (b). This figure depicts the correct response of plant towards gravity. The response of plants towards gravity is known as geotropism. Roots responds by moving towards the centre of gravity, while shoots move in the opposite direction of gravity.","Figure 7.5 Response of the plant to the direction of light
 Environmental triggers such as light, or gravity will change the directions that plant parts grow in. These directional, or tropic, movements can be either towards the stimulus, or away from it. So, in two different kinds of phototropic movement, shoots respond by bending towards light while roots Figure 7.6 Plant showing geotropism respond by bending away from it. How does this help the plant? Plants show tropism in response to other stimuli as well. The roots of a plant always grow downwards while the shoots usually grow upwards and away from the earth. This upward and downward growth of shoots and roots, respectively, in response to the pull of earth or gravity is, obviously, geotropism (Fig. 7.6). If ‘hydro’ means water and ‘chemo’ refers to chemicals, what would ‘hydrotropism’ and ‘chemotropism’ mean? Can we think of examples of these kinds of directional growth movements? One example of chemotropism is the growth of pollen tubes towards ovules, about which we will learn more when we examine the reproductive processes of living organisms. Let us now once again think about how information is communicated in the bodies of multicellular organisms. The movement of the sensitive plant in response to touch is very quick. The movement of sunflowers in response to day or night, on the other hand, is quite slow. Growth-related movement of plants will be even slower. Even in animal bodies, there are carefully controlled directions to growth. Our arms and fingers grow in certain directions, not haphazardly. So controlled movements can be either slow or fast. If fast responses to stimuli are to be made, information transfer must happen very quickly. For this, the medium of transmission must be able to move rapidly. 121

"In plants, nervous system is absent. How do plants control and co-ordinate different activities ?","In plants, the control and co-ordination is entirely chemical. Plants coordinate their behaviour against environmental changes with the help of Hormones. Plants have various hormones that help them to coordinate growth and response to environment. These are the chemical compounds which are released by stimulated cells. Hormones are diffused around the cell. Different hormones in plants are Auxins, Gribberllins, Cutokinins and abscissic acid.","Electrical impulses are an excellent means for this. But there are limitations to the use of electrical impulses. Firstly, they will reach only those cells that are connected by nervous tissue, not each and every cell in the animal body. Secondly, once an electrical impulse is generated in a cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms before it can generate and transmit a new impulse. In other words, cells cannot continually create and transmit electrical impulses. It is thus no wonder that most multicellular organisms use another means of communication between cells, namely, chemical communication. If, instead of generating an electrical impulse, stimulated cells release a chemical compound, this compound would diffuse all around the original cell. If other cells around have the means to detect this compound using special molecules on their surfaces, then they would be able to recognise information, and even transmit it. This will be slower, of course, but it can potentially reach all cells of the body, regardless of nervous connections, and it can be done steadily and persistently. These compounds, or hormones used by multicellular organisms for control and coordination show a great deal of diversity, as we would expect. Different plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and responses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from where they act and simply diffuse to the area of action. Let us take an example that we have worked with earlier [Activity 7.2]. When growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised at the shoot tip, helps the cells to grow longer. When light is coming from one side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot. This concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the side of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to bend towards light. Another example of plant hormones are gibberellins which, like auxins, help in the growth of the stem. Cytokinins promote cell division, and it is natural then that they are present in greater concentration in areas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds. These are examples of plant hormones that help in promoting growth. But plants also need signals to stop growing. Abscisic acid is one example of a hormone which inhibits growth. Its effects include wilting of leaves.

Name the property that causes tendril to circle around the object. Explain how it happens and how is plant benefitted by it.  3,"Sensitivity to touch : When tendril of a plant comes in contact with any object, the part of the tendril in contact with the object does not grow as rapidly as that part which is away from the object. This causes the tendril to circle around the object. The plant gets the support of the object for growing upward without falling. ","7.2.1 Immediate Response to Stimulus Let us think about the first kind of movement, such as that of the sensitive plant. Since no growth is involved, the plant must actually move its leaves in response to touch. But there is no nervous tissue, nor any muscle tissue. How does the plant detect the touch, and how do the leaves move in response?
 Figure 7.4 The sensitive plant
 Figure 7.4 The sensitive plant
 If we think about where exactly the plant is touched, and what part of the plant actually moves, it is apparent that movement happens at a point different from the point of touch. So, information that a touch has occurred must be communicated. The plants also use electrical-chemical means to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals, there is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information. Finally, again as in animals, some cells must change shape in order for movement to happen. Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal muscle cells, plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water in them, resulting in swelling or shrinking, and therefore in changing shapes.

 7.2.2 Movement Due to Growth Some plants like the pea plant climb up other plants or fences by means of tendrils. These tendrils are sensitive to touch. When they come in contact with any support, the part of the tendril in contact with the object does not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object. This causes the tendril to circle around the object and thus cling to it. More commonly, plants respond to stimuli slowly by growing in a particular direction. Because this growth is directional, it appears as if the plant is moving. Let us understand this type of movement with the help of an example.

If accidentally we step on something sharp at once we move our foot away. What is this type of response known as ? State how it is controlled. 3,Response ¾® Reflex action. (i) A receptor to perceive the stimulus. (ii) A sensory or afferent nerve which carries the message from receptor to spinal cord. (iii) The neurons of spinal cord transmit the impulse from afferent neurons to efferent neurons. (iv) Motor nerve carries message from spinal cord to the muscles that show response.,"7.1.2 Human Brain Is reflex action the only function of the spinal cord? Obviously not, since we know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of nerves which supply information to think about. Thinking involves more complex mechanisms and neural connections. These are concentrated in the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body. The brain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system. They receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it. We also think about our actions. Writing, talking, moving a chair, clapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions which are based on deciding what to do next. So, the brain also has to send messages to muscles. This is the second way in which the nervous system communicates with the muscles. The communication between the central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated by the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising from the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain thus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking. As you will expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different parts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs. The brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain, mid-brain and hind-brain. The fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions which receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas of the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on. There are separate areas of association where this sensory information is interpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors as well as with information that is already stored in the brain.

These are usually present as sulphides or carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as compared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction, the metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal oxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly in the presence of excess air. This process is known as roasting. The carbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited air. This process is known as calcination. The chemical reaction that takes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown as follows – Roasting 2ZnS(s) + 3O2 (g) Heat  → 2ZnO(s) + 2SO2 (g)
 Calcination ZnCO3 (s) Heat  → ZnO(s) + CO2 (g)
 The metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by using suitable reducing agents such as carbon. For example, when zinc oxide is heated with carbon, it is reduced to metallic zinc. ZnO(s) + C(s) → Zn(s) + CO(g) You are already familiar with the process of oxidation and reduction explained in the first Chapter. Obtaining metals from their compounds is also a reduction process.
