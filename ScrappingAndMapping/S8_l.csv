Explain the process of reproduction in human beings with suitable diagrams.,"Reproduction in human beings : In human, internal reproduction takes place. There are two sexes in human beings—male & female. Male reproductive parts include a pair of testes, two sperm ducts and a penis. The testes produce the sperms. The female reproductive organs are a pair of ovaries, oviduct and the Uterus Ovary Zygote Embedding embryo Fig. Reproduction in Human Beings uterus. The ovary produces female gametes called ova. Fusion of the egg and the sperm is called fertilization. This results in the formation of a fertilized egg or zygote. Zygote begins to develop into an embryo. The zygote repeatedly gives rise to a ball of cells. The cells then begin to form groups and organs of the body which form embryo. The stage of the embryo in which all the body parts can be identified is called foetus. When the development of the foetus is complete, the mother gives birth to the baby.","female gametes called ova (eggs) (Fig. 9.4). In human beings, a single matured egg is released into the oviduct by one of the ovaries every month. Uterus is the part where development of the baby takes place. Like the sperm, an egg is also a single cell.

Coating of chromium on metals give lustre to objects.,"The process of depositing a layer of any desired metal on another material by means of electricity is called electroplating. It is one of the most common applications of chemical effects of electric current. Electroplating is a very useful process. It is widely used in industry for coating metal objects with a thin layer of a different metal (Fig.14.8). The layer of metal deposited has some desired property, which the metal of the object lacks. For example, chromium plating is done on many objects such as car parts, bath taps, kitchen gas burners, bicycle handlebars, wheel rims and many others. Chromium has a shiny appearance. It does not corrode. It resists scratches. However, chromium is expensive and it may not be economical to make the whole object out of chromium. So the object is made from a cheaper metal and only a coating of chromium over it is deposited. Jewellery makers electroplate

Discuss various systems of irrigation.,"The supply of water to crops at different intervals is called irrigation. Various systems of irrigation are :  Traditional methods : The water available in wells, lakes and canals is lifted up by :  Moat ;  Chain pump  Dhekli and;  Rahat  Pumps are commonly used for lifting water.  Modern methods :  Sprinkler system : This system is more useful on uneven land. The perpendicular pipes, having rotating nozzles on top, are jointed to the main pipeline at regular intervals. When water flows through main pipes, it gets sprinkled on the crop as if it is raining.  Drip system : In this system water falls drop by drop just at the position of the roots. It is the best technique for watering fruit plants, garden and trees.","Modern Methods of Irrigation Modern methods of irrigation help us to use water economically. The main methods used are as follows: (i) Sprinkler System: This system is more useful on the uneven land where sufficient water is not available. The perpendicular pipes, having rotating nozzles on top, are joined to the main pipeline at regular intervals. When water is allowed to flow through the main pipe under pressure with the help of a pump, it escapes from the rotating nozzles. It gets sprinkled on the crop as if it is raining. Sprinkler is very useful for lawns, coffee plantation and several other crops [Fig. 1.5 (a)].
 Fig. 1.5 (a) : Sprinkler system
 (ii) Drip system : In this system, the water falls drop by drop directly near the roots. So it is called drip system. It is the best technique for watering fruit plants, gardens and trees [Fig. 1.5(b)]. Water is not wasted at all. It is a boon in regions where availability of water is poor.

Cultivator : Ploughing in done by tractordriver cultivator. It uses same labour and time.","turning and loosening of soil is very important for cultivation of crops. The process of loosening and turning of the soil is called tilling or ploughing. This is done by using a plough. Ploughs are made of wood or iron. If the soil is very dry, it may need watering before ploughing. The ploughed field may have big clumps of soil called crumbs. It is necessary to break these crumbs. Levelling the field is beneficial for sowing as well as for irrigation. Levelling of soil is done with the help of a leveller. Sometimes, manure is added to the soil before tilling. This helps in proper mixing of manure with soil. The soil is moistened before sowing. Agricultural Implements Before sowing the seeds, it is necessary to break soil clumps to get better yield. This is done with the help of various tools. The main tools used for this purpose are the plough, hoe and cultivator.
 Plough : This is being used since ancient times for tilling the soil, adding fertilisers to the crop, removing the weeds and turning the soil. This is made of wood and is drawn by a pair of bulls or other animals (horses and camels). It contains a strong triangular iron strip called ploughshare. The main part of the plough is a long log of wood which is called a ploughshaft. There is a handle at one end of the shaft. The other end is attached to a beam which is placed on the bulls’ necks. One pair of bulls and a man can easily operate the plough [Fig. 1.1 (a)]. The indigenous wooden plough is increasingly being replaced by iron ploughs nowadays. Hoe : It is a simple tool which is used for removing weeds and for loosening the soil. It has a long rod of wood or iron. A strong, broad and bent plate of iron is fixed to one of its ends and

Experimentally explain that pressure is exerted by liquid and gases on the wall of the containers.,"Pressure exerted by liquid and gases on the wall of container can be explained by the following experiments. Take a plastic bottle. Fix a cylindrical glass tube  near its bottom. Make sure that the water does not leak from the joint. Cover the mouth of glass tube with a thin rubber sheet. Fill the bottle upto half with water. The bulging of the rubber sheet in the case indicates that water exerts pressure on the sides of container or we can say that liquid exerts pressure on the walls of container. In the case of gas, when we inflate a balloon the balloon will be filled with air and air exerts pressure and its shape has changed. So we find that gases, too, exert pressure on the walls of their container.","Can you now say that liquids exert pressure on the walls of the container? Do gases also exert pressure?

What are contact and non-contact forces ? Explain briefly with suitable examples.,"Forces can be of two types : 1. Contact forces. 2. Non-contact forces.  Contact forces : The forces that come into play when two objects come in contact with each other.  Muscular force : The force which is exerted due to action of muscles is known as the muscular force. e.g., running, bending, walking etc.  Frictional Force : The force respoonsible for changing the state of motion of an object. Equal and opposite forces are being exerted on an object when its surface comes in contact with other surface. e.g., a car or scooter comes to rest.  Non-contact forces : The forces that can be exerted from a distance without establishing a contact are called the noncontact forces.  Magnetic force : Force exerted by a magnet on another magnet or magnetic substance like iron is called magnetic force.  Electrostatic force : Force exerted by a charged body on another charged body or uncharged body is called electrostatic force. e.g., If we rub a comb with hair and bring it near some small bits of paper it attracts the bits of paper towards itself. This is electrostatic force.  Force of gravity : The earth pulls every freely falling object towards its centre. The force exerted by the Earth is called the force of gravity.","Since muscular force can be applied only when it is in contact with an object, it is also called a contact force. Are there other types of contact forces? Let us find out. Friction

Plastic is not environment friendly. Explain.,"Plastic is a non-biodegradable substance, so it cannot be decomposed. It is creating a great problem for environment. While burning it gives lots of poisonous gases and takes a long time to degrade This pollution is a major threat to our environment.  Polyethene bags are also a big threat to our environment. They are non-biodegradable substances. When people throw peels of vegetables and left over food items in plastic bags they are eaten by animals such as cows. The plastic material chokes the respiratory system of these animals or forms a lining in their stomach and can be the cause of their death.  The polybags carelessly thrown here and there are responsible for clogging the drains. Carelessly the wrappers of chips, biscuits etc.     are thrown here and there on picnic spots and roads which all create pollution in our environment. Plastic waste when dumped in water, causes water pollution. Aquatic animals consume these plastics and die. Hence, the plastic is not environment friendly.","Since plastic takes several years to decompose, it is not environment friendly. It causes environmental pollution. Besides, the burning process in the synthetic material is quite slow and it does not get completely burnt easily. In the process it releases lots of poisonous fumes into the atmosphere causing air pollution. How can this problem be solved? Have you ever seen a garbage dump where animals are eating garbage? In the process of eating the food waste they swallow materials like polythene bags and wrappers of food. Can you imagine the consequences? The plastic material chokes the respiratory system of these animals, or forms a lining in their stomachs and can be the cause of their death. The polybags carelessly thrown here and there are responsible for clogging the drains, too. Sometimes we are very careless and throw the wrappers of chips, biscuits and other eatables on the road or in parks or picnic places. Should we not think twice before doing so ? As a responsible citizen what measures do you suggest to keep public places clean and free of plastic?
 Avoid the use of plastics as far as possible. Make use of bags made of cotton or jute when you go for shopping. The biodegradable and nonbiodegradable wastes should be collected separately and disposed off separately. Practise this in your homes. Can you suggest some other ways in which you can contribute towards reducing the use of plastic materials? It is better to recycle plastic waste. Most of the thermoplastics can be recycled. Make a list of items that can be recycled. However, during recycling certain colouring agents are added. This limits its usage especially for storage of food. As a responsible citizen remember the 5 R principle. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recover and Refuse. Develop habits which are environment friendly. Fibre-wise Ü Ü Ü
 The waste created by plastics is not environment friendly. On burning, plastics release poisonous gases. On dumping in the ground they may take years to degenerate. This is because of their non-biodegradable nature.

‘Plastic as material of choice’. Explain with suitable examples.,"Plastic is a material of choice. It is also a polymer like the synthetic fibre. It can be used easily as follows. Plastic is easily moulded, i.e., can be shaped in any form. It can be recycled, reused, coloured, melted, rolled into sheets or made into wires. Plastics are strong, light weight and durable. Plastic containers seem to be the most convenient. They are easy to carry.","3.5 Plastics as Materials of Choice Today if we think of storing a food item, water, milk, pickles, dry food etc., plastic containers seem most convenient. This is because of their light weight, lower price, good strength and easy handling. Being lighter as compared to metals, plastics are used in cars, aircrafts and spacecrafts, too. The list is endless if we start counting articles like slippers, furniture, decoration pieces, etc. Now, let us discuss the characteristic properties of plastics. Plastic is Non-reactive You know that metals like iron get rusted when left exposed to moisture and air. But plastics do not react with water and air. They are not corroded easily. That is why they are used to store various kinds of material, including many chemicals. Plastic is Light, Strong and Durable

Give examples to show that friction is both a friend and a foe.,"Friction is a friend because :  we can not write with pen or pencil, if there is no friction.  we are unable to write on the black board with a chalk.  if an object starts moving, it would never stop.  the vehicles cannot be started or stopped.  we cannot fix a nail on the wall or tie a knot without friction Friction as foe because :  it wears out materials whether they are screws, ball bearings.  the shoes wear out due to friction.  friction also produces heat. When a machine is operated, heat is generated that causes wastage of energy.  the tyres of cars, buses and trucks etc also wear out due to friction.  Friction reduces the speed due to which more force is required.","Friction is important for many of our activities.
 "
Discuss the various ways to reduce the friction.,"Friction may be reduced in the following ways :  Polishing the surface : We polish the rubbing surfaces to reduce their unevenness and make them smooth.  Lubricating the surface : To reduce friction in order to increase efficiency when oil, grease or graphite is applied between the moving parts of a machine, a thin layer is formed there and moving surfaces do not directly rub against each other. These substances are lubricants which reduce the friction.  Using wheels and ball bearings : By using wheels and ball bearing we convert sliding friction into rolling friction. This reduces friction between the two contact surfaces and helps us to save energy, effort and time.  Streamlining : Objects are to given special shapes, such as streamlined body to aeroplanes. Their bodies shapes them and make them lose less energy in overcoming friction. Hence, all vehicles are designed to have shapes that reduce fluid friction.","friction in order to increase efficiency. When oil, grease or graphite is applied between the moving part of a machine, a thin layer is formed there and moving surfaces do not directly rub against each other (Fig. 12.13). Interlocking of irregularities is avoided to a great extent. Movement becomes smooth. The substances which reduce friction are called lubricants. In some machines, it may not be advisable to use oil as lubricant. An air cushion between the moving parts is used to reduce friction. Surface 2
 In many machines, friction is reduced by using ball bearings.
 Ü
 Fluid friction can be minimised by giving suitable shapes to bodies moving in fluids.
 "
Name the factors that affect friction.,Factors affecting friction :  It depends on the nature of surfaces in contact.  It is more between rough surfaces and less between smooth surfaces.  It depends on how hard the two surfaces press together.  It is independent of the area of contact.,"Friction depends on the nature of surfaces in contact.
 For a given pair of surfaces friction depends surfaces.

Explain the harmful effects of burning fuels.,"The harmful effects of burning fuels :  Fuels like wood, coal, petroleum etc. which are carbon fuels, produce unburnt carbon particles, which cause respiratory diseases  and skin diseases.  Generally CO 2 is released during burning of fuels. It causes the rise in the temperature of the atmosphere of Earth, which is called global warm-ing.  Incomplete combustion of fuel releases many poisonous gases such as carbon monoxide. It can kill people sleeping in a room containing carbon monoxide.  Combustion of coal and diesel generates sulphur dioxide. It is a corrosive gas and it causes suffocation.  Burning of fuels releases oxides of nitrogen and sulphur. They dissolve in rain water and form acid. Such rain is called acid rain. It is harmful to crops, buildings and soil.","particles. These fine particles are dangerous pollutants causing respiratory diseases, such as asthma. 2. Incomplete combustion of these fuels gives carbon monoxide gas. It is a very poisonous gas. It is dangerous to burn coal in a closed room. The carbon monoxide gas produced can kill persons sleeping in that room. Oh! So, that is why we are advised never to sleep in a room with burning or smouldering coal fire in it.
 3. Combustion of most fuels releases carbon dioxide in the environment. Increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the air is believed to cause global warming. Global warming is the rise in temperature of the atmosphere of the earth. This results, among other things, in the melting of polar glaciers, which leads to a rise in the sea level, causing floods in the coastal areas. Low lying coastal areas may even be permanently submerged under water.

 Burning of Fuels Leads to Harmful Products The increasing fuel consumption has harmful effects on the environment. 1. Carbon fuels like wood, coal, petroleum release unburnt carbon For centuries, wood was used as domestic and industrial fuel. But now it has been replaced by coal and other fuels like LPG. In many rural parts of our country, people still use wood as a fuel because of its easy availability and low cost. However, burning of wood gives a lot of smoke which is very harmful for human beings. It causes respiratory problem. Also, trees provide us with useful substances which are lost when wood is used as fuel. Moreover cutting of trees leads to deforestation which is quite harmful to the environment, as you learnt in Class VII.

Explain and draw nitrogen cycle.,"Nitrogen cycle. Fig. Nitrogen Cycle  Our atmosphere has 78% of nitrogen gas. Certain bacteria and blue-green algae are present in soil that fix nitrogen.  They convert it into compound of Nitrogen.  These compounds can be used by plants through soil.  Plants synthesize proteins and other compounds.  Animals, feeding on plants get these.  When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi present in the soil decompose them and again convert into nitrogenous compound. Certain bacteria convert it into nitrogen gas, which goes back to the atmosphere. 5","2.7 Nitrogen cycle Our atmosphere has 78% nitrogen gas. Nitrogen is one of the essential constituents of all living organisms as part of proteins, chlorophyll, nucleic acids and vitamins. The atmospheric
 nitrogen cannot be taken directly by plants and animals. Certain bacteria and blue green algae present in the soil fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into compounds of nitrogen. Once nitrogen is converted into these usable compounds, it can be utilised by plants from the soil through their root system. Nitrogen is then used for the synthesis of plant proteins and other compounds. Animals feeding on plants get these proteins and other nitrogen compounds (Fig. 2.10). When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi present in the soil convert the nitrogenous wastes into nitrogenous compounds to be used by plants again. Certain other bacteria convert some part of them to nitrogen gas which goes back into the atmosphere. As a result, the percentage of nitrogen in the atmosphere remains more or less constant.

What do you understand by food preservation ? Explain any four methods of food preservation.,"Micro-organisms spoil our food. The process used for various purposes. They are used of keeping our food safe from micro-organism is called food preservation. Various methods of food preservation are :  Drying : It reduces the moisture of food material which prevents growth of micro organisms.  By common salt and sugar : Meat and fish are covered with dry salt to check the growth of bacteria. Sugar reduces the moisture content, which inhibits the growth of bacteria that spoils food.  By oil and vinegar : Use of oil and vinegar prevents spoilage of pickles because bacteria cannot live in such an environment.  Refrigeration and freezing : Low temperature retards this growth. Thus, it is safe for food.  By chemicals : Chemicals such as sodium benzoate and potassium metabisulphite are used in jams, squash and ketchup.  ","make the food poisonous causing serious illness and even death. So, it is very important that we preserve food to prevent it from being spoilt.
 2.5 Food Preservation In Chapter 1, we have learnt about the methods used to preserve and store food grains. How do we preserve cooked food at home? You know that bread left unused under moist conditions is attacked by fungus. Microorganisms spoil our food. Spoiled food emits bad smell and has a bad taste and changed colour. Is spoiling of food a chemical reaction? Paheli bought some mangoes but she could not eat them for a few days. Later she found that they were spoilt and rotten. But she knows that the mango pickle her grandmother makes does not spoil for a long time. She is confused. 25
 Let us study the common methods of preserving food in our homes. We have to save it from the attack of microorganisms.
 Similarly, we keep our food in the refrigerator. Low temperature inhibits the growth of microbes.
 Chemical Method Salts and edible oils are the common chemicals generally used to check the growth of microorganisms. Therefore they are called preservatives. We add salt or acid preservatives to pickles to prevent the attack of microbes. Sodium benzoate and sodium metabisulphite are common preservatives. These are also used in jams and squashes to check their spoilage. Preservation by Common Salt Common salt has been used to preserve meat and fish for ages. Meat and fish are covered with dry salt to check the growth of bacteria. Salting is also used to preserve amla, raw mangoes, tamarind, etc. Preservation by Sugar Jams, jellies and squashes are preserved by sugar. Sugar reduces the moisture content which inhibits the growth of bacteria which spoil food. Preservation by Oil and Vinegar Use of oil and vinegar prevents spoilage of pickles because bacteria cannot live in such an environment. Vegetables, fruits, fish and meat are often preserved by this method. Heat and Cold Treatments You must have observed your mother boiling milk before it is stored or used. Boiling kills many microorganisms.

List all the changes that occur during puberty. Explain in brief. ,"The human body undergoes several changes during adolescence. These changes mark the onset of puberty. It ends when an adolescent reaches reproductive maturity. The changes taking place in the body are :  Increase in height.  Change in body shape. The boys shoulders become wider and in the girls the region below the waist becomes wider.  Change in voice—in the boys, the voice box enlarges and can be seen as the protruding part of the throat called Adam’s apple. In girls, it is hardly visible.  Increased activity of sweat and sebaceous gland which may cause acne and pimples.  Sex organs develop fully and reach maturity.  They also reach upto mental, intel-lectual and emotional maturity.  Secondary sexual characters also develope. For example, in male hair on face, under arms. In girls, under arms and hair grow above the thighs. ","List changes in the body that take place at puberty.

Explain reproductive phase of life in humans.,"Reproductive phase of life in humans : Adolescents become capable of reproduction when their testes and ovaries begin to produce gametes. The hormone testosterone in male is secreted by testes. In female, the reproductive phase begins at puberty–10 to 12 yrs to 45-50 yrs. The ovum matures and is released by one of the ovaries once in 28 to 30 days. During this period, the wall of the uterus becomes thick. If it is fertilized, it results in pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the eggs and the thickened lining of the uterus along with blood vessels is sheded off. This cause menstruation. Sex is also determined by the sex hormones X and Y. Male have ‘XY’ chromosomes and female have ‘XX’ chromosome in their body. The baby child will be male if the sper m contributes ‘Y’ chromosome and child will be female if the sperm releases ‘X’ chromosomes. Hence, males are responsible for sex determination in humans.","10.5 Reproductive Phase of Life in Humans Adolescents become capable of reproduction when their testes and ovaries begin to produce gametes. The capacity for maturation and production of gametes lasts for a much longer time in males than in females. In females, the reproductive phase of life begins at puberty (10 to 12 years of age) and generally lasts till the age of approximately 45 to 50 years. The ova begin to mature with the onset of puberty. One ovum matures and is released by one of the ovaries once in about 28 to 30 days. During this period, the wall of the uterus becomes thick so as to receive the egg, in case it is fertilised and begins to develop. This results in pregnancy. If fertilisation does not occur, the released egg, and the thickened lining of the uterus along with its blood vessels are shed off. This causes bleeding in women which is called menstruation. Menstruation occurs once in about 28 to 30 days. The first menstrual flow begins at puberty and is termed menarche. At 45 to 50 years of age, the menstrual cycle stops. Stoppage of menstruation is termed menopause. Initially, menstrual cycle may be irregular. It take some time to become regular.

Explain protection against earthquake.,"Protection against earthquakes : Earthquakes cannot be predicted. They can be highly destructive. It is, therefore, important that we take necessary precautions to protect ourselves all the time. It is advisable to make the structure simple so that it is ‘Quake Safe’. — Consult qualified architects and structural engineers. — In highly seismic area, the use of mud and timber is better. They keep roofs light. — Fix shelves and cupboards to the walls. — Be careful where you hang wall clocks, photo frames, water heaters etc. — Building can catch fire during earthquake. So all buildings, must have fire fighting equipments in working order. In the event that an earthquake does strike, take the following steps to protect yourself. At home : Take shelter under a table, stay away from tall and heavy objects and if you are in bed, do not get up. Protect your head with a pillow. Outdoors : Find a clean spot, away from buildings, trees, and over headed power lines, Drop to ground. If you are in car or bus do not come out.","Protection against Earthquakes We know from the earlier pages that earthquakes cannot be predicted. We have also seen that they can be highly destructive. It is, therefore, important that we take necessary precautions to protect ourselves all the time. People
 living in seismic zones, where the earthquakes are more likely to occur, have to be specially prepared. First of all, the buildings in these zones should be so designed that they can withstand major tremors. Modern building technology can make it possible.
 Consult qualified architects and structural engineers. In highly seismic areas, the use of mud or timber is better than using heavy construction material. Keep roofs as light as possible. In case the structure falls, the damage will not be heavy. It is better if the cupboards and shelves are fixed to the walls, so that they do not fall easily. Be careful where you hang wall clocks, photo-frames, water heaters etc., so that in the event of an earthquake, they do not fall on people. Since some buildings may catch fire due to an earthquake, it is necessary that all buildings, especially tall buildings, have fire fighting equipment in working order.
 The Central Building Research Institute, Roorkee, has developed knowhow to make quake-resistant houses. In the event that an earthquake does strike, take the following steps to protect yourself. 1. If you are at home l Take shelter under a table and stay there till the shaking stops. l Stay away from tall and heavy objects that may fall on you. l If you are in bed, do not get up. Protect your head with a pillow. 2. If you are outdoors l Find a clear spot, away from buildings, trees and overhead power lines. Drop to the ground. l If you are in a car or a bus, do not come out. Ask the driver to drive slowly to a clear spot. Do not come out till the tremors stop.

Explain the mechanism of thunder storms.,"Mechanism of thunderstrom or the story of lightning : During the development of a thunderstorm, the air current moves up- wards while the water droplets move downwards. These vigorous movement cause separation of charges. By a process, the positive charges collect near the upper edges of the clouds and the negative charges accumulate near the lower edges. There is accumulation of the charges near the ground also. When the magnitude of accumulated charges becomes very large, negative and positive charges meet. It produces streaks of light and sound. This process is called electric discharge.","You learnt in Class VII that during the development of a thunderstorm, the air currents move upward while the water droplets move downward.

By a process, not yet completely understood, the positive charges collect near the upper edges of the clouds and the negative charges accumulate near the lower edges. There is accumulation of positive charges near the ground also. When the magnitude of the accumulated charges becomes very large, the air which is normally a poor conductor of electricity, is no longer able to resist their flow. Negative and positive charges meet, producing streaks of bright light and sound. We see streaks as lightning (Fig. 15.5). The process is called an electric discharge.

How does air get polluted ? Explain.,"Air gets polluted by many reasons. Few of them are as follow :  Vehicles produce high level of pollutants like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, smoke etc. These are very poisonous gases. Burning of fuel from vehicles also produce pollution.  Many industries are also responsible for causing air pollution. Petroleum refineries, release polluted gases such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide etc. They cause respiratory problems, including lung damage.  Other kind of pollutants like CFCs which are largely used in refrigerators, air conditioners and aerosol sprays. These CFC ’s damage ozone layer, which protects us from ultraviolet rays of the sun.  Some human activities like forest fire, burning of fire wood, cow dung cake, burning of chaff etc., cause air pollution.  Some natural phenomenon like fast dust storms volcanic eruption produce smoke and dust particles.","18.2 How does Air Get Polluted? The substances which contaminate the air are called air pollutants. Sometimes, such substances may come from natural sources like smoke and dust arising from forest fires or volcanic eruptions. Pollutants are also added to the atmosphere by certain human activities. The sources of air pollutants are factories (Fig. 18.2), power plants, automobile exhausts and burning of firewood and dung cakes.
 Activity 18.2 You might have read in the newspapers that respiratory problems amongst children are rising day by day. Conduct a survey of households in your neighbourhood and among friends to find out how many children are suffering from respiratory problems. Many respiratory problems are caused by air pollution. Let us now try to find out the substances or pollutants which are present in the polluted air. Have you noticed how rapidly the number of vehicles is increasing in our cities? Vehicles produce high levels of pollutants like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and smoke (Fig. 18.3). Carbon monoxide is produced from incomplete burning of fuels such as petrol and diesel. It is a poisonous gas. It reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.
