A student is studying the properties of acetic acid in his school laboratory. List two physical and two chemical properties which he must observe and note in his record book. ,Physical Properties : (i) Smell like vinegar (ii) Colourless liquid. Chemical Properties : (i) Turns blue litmus red (ii) Gives brisk effervescence with sodium carbonate,"You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour of blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of the red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another such indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth becomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed on it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of water. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and phenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how acids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting things that we use and see in our day-to-day life.
 Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to the division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus solution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural materials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as Hydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a solution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.

"A student takes about 6 ml of distilled water in each of the four test tubes P, Q, R and S. He then dissolves an equal amount of four different salts namely, sodium chloride in ‘P’, potassium chloride in ‘Q’, calcium chloride in ‘R’ and magnesium chloride in ‘S’. Next, he then adds 10 drops of soap solution to each test tube and shakes its contents. In which of these test tubes the scum (insoluble substance) is formed with soap?","Scum is formed by reaction of soap with calcium and magnesium salts in water. Test-tubes R and S contain calcium chloride and magnesium chloride, respectively. Therefore, scum will be formed in these two test-tubes.","Take two test tubes with about 10 mL of hard water in each. Add five drops of soap solution to one and five drops of detergent solution to the other. Shake both test tubes for the same period. Do both test tubes have the same amount of foam? In which test tube is a curdy solid formed?
 Have you ever observed while bathing that foam is formed with difficulty and an insoluble substance (scum) remains after washing with water? This is caused by the reaction of soap with the calcium and magnesium salts, which cause the hardness of water. Hence you need to use a larger amount of soap. This problem is overcome by using another class of compounds called detergents as cleansing agents. Detergents are generally sodium salts of sulphonic acids or ammonium salts with chlorides or bromides ions, etc. Both have long hydrocarbon chain. The charged ends of these compounds do not form insoluble precipitates with the calcium and magnesium ions in hard water. Thus, they remain effective in hard water. Detergents are usually used to make shampoos and products for cleaning clothes.

"During saponification reaction, Rupal takes refined oil in a test-tube and adds 20% NaOH solution. She then stirs the reacting mixture. Write down the observation she will observe?",She will observe that soap settles down in the testtube.,"This activity demonstrates the effect of soap in cleaning. Most dirt is oily in nature and as you know, oil does not dissolve in water. The molecules of soap are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic acids. The ionic-end of soap interacts with water while the carbon chain interacts with oil. The soap molecules, thus form structures called micelles (see Fig. 4.12) where one end of the molecules is towards the oil droplet while the ionic-end faces outside. This forms an emulsion in water. The soap micelle thus helps in pulling out the dirt in water and we can wash our clothes clean (Fig. 4.13). Can you draw the structure of the micelle that would be formed if you dissolve soap in a hydrocarbon?

 Micelles Soaps are molecules in which the two ends have differing properties, one is hydrophilic, that is, it interacts with water, while the other end is hydrophobic, that is, it interacts with hydrocarbons. When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic ‘tail’ of soap will not be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the ionic end in water and the hydrocarbon ‘tail’ protruding out of water. Inside water,

Soap in the form of a micelle is able to clean, since the oily dirt will be collected in the centre of the micelle. The micelles stay in solution as a colloid and will not come together to precipitate because of ion-ion repulsion. Thus, the dirt suspended in the micelles is also easily rinsed away. The soap micelles are large enough to scatter light. Hence a soap solution appears cloudy. Figure 4.13 Effect of soap in cleaning

Johanson observed the temporary mount of a leaf peel under a compound microscope and found one pore as an elliptical pore and the other kidney shaped. Name the parts. ,Elliptical shape pore is stoma. Kidney shape is guard cells. ,"Now, let us study how the plant obtains carbon dioxide. In Class IX, we had talked about stomata (Fig. 6.3) which are tiny pores present on the surface of the leaves. Massive amounts of gaseous exchange takes place in the leaves through these pores for the purpose of photosynthesis. But it is important to note here that exchange of gases occurs across the surface of stems, roots and leaves as well. Since large amounts of water can also be lost through these stomata, the plant Figure 6.3 (a) Open and (b) closed stomatal pore closes these pores when it does not need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. The opening and closing of the pore is a function of the guard cells. The guard cells swell when water flows into them, causing the stomatal pore to open. Similarly the pore closes if the guard cells shrink.
 like in the lungs, is a cluster of very thin-walled blood capillaries. Each capillary cluster in the kidney is associated with the cup-shaped end of a coiled tube called Bowman’s capsule that collects the filtrate (Fig. 6.14). Each kidney has large numbers of these filtration units called nephrons packed close together. Some substances in the initial filtrate, such as glucose, amino acids, salts and a major amount of water, are selectively re-absorbed as the urine flows along the tube. The amount of water re-absorbed depends on how much excess water there is in the body, and on how much of dissolved waste there is to be excreted. The urine forming in each kidney eventually enters a long tube, the ureter, which connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder. Urine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure of the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out through the urethra. The bladder is muscular, so it is under nervous control, as we have discussed elsewhere. As a result, we can usually control the urge to urinate.

State the importance of stomata for a plant. ,Importance of Stomata— (i) Helps in exchange of gases like O2 and CO2. (ii) Removes extra water from leaves by transpiration.  1 + 1,"Provided that the plant has an adequate supply of water, the water which is lost through the stomata is replaced by water from the xylem vessels in the leaf. In fact, evaporation of water molecules from the cells of a leaf creates a suction which pulls water from the xylem cells of roots. The loss of water in the form of vapour from the aerial parts of the plant is known as transpiration. Thus, transpiration helps in the absorption and upward movement of water and minerals dissolved in it from roots to the leaves. It also helps in temperature regulation. The effect of root pressure in transport of water is more important at night. During the day when the stomata are open, the transpiration pull becomes the major driving force in the movement Figure 6.12 of water in the xylem. Movement of water during transpiration in a tree Transport of food and other substances So far we have discussed the transport of water and minerals in plants. Now let us consider how the products of metabolic processes, particularly photosynthesis, are moved from leaves, where they are formed, to other parts of the plant. This transport of soluble products of photosynthesis is called translocation and it occurs in the part of the vascular tissue known as phloem. Besides the products of photosynthesis, the phloem transports amino acids and other substances. These substances are especially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and to growing organs. The translocation of food and other substances takes place in the sieve tubes with the help of adjacent companion cells both in upward and downward directions. Unlike transport in xylem which can be largely explained by simple physical forces, the translocation in phloem is achieved by utilising

 Take a potted plant with variegated leaves – for example, money plant or crotons. Keep the plant in a dark room for three days so that all the starch gets used up. Now keep the plant in sunlight for about six hours. Pluck a leaf from the plant. Mark the green areas in it and trace them on a sheet of paper. Dip the leaf in boiling water for a few minutes. After this, immerse it in a beaker containing alcohol. Carefully place the above beaker in a water-bath and heat till the alcohol begins to boil. What happens to the colour of the leaf? What is the colour of the solution? Now dip the leaf in a dilute solution of iodine for a few minutes. Take out the leaf and rinse off the iodine solution.

Mention any two functions of epidermis. ,"(i) Epidermis on the aerial parts of plants often secrete a waxy, water resistant layer on their outer surface. (ii) They prevent water loss, mechanical injury and invasion by parasitic bacteria or fungi. ","If we think about where exactly the plant is touched, and what part of the plant actually moves, it is apparent that movement happens at a point different from the point of touch. So, information that a touch has occurred must be communicated. The plants also use electrical-chemical means to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals, there is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information. Finally, again as in animals, some cells must change shape in order for movement to happen. Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal muscle cells, plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water in them, resulting in swelling or shrinking, and therefore in changing shapes.

Why upper surface of the leaf has fewer stomata ?,Fewer stomata on the upper surface prevent excessive loss of water due to transpiration as this surface is directly exposed to sunlight.,"Provided that the plant has an adequate supply of water, the water which is lost through the stomata is replaced by water from the xylem vessels in the leaf. In fact, evaporation of water molecules from the cells of a leaf creates a suction which pulls water from the xylem cells of roots. The loss of water in the form of vapour from the aerial parts of the plant is known as transpiration.

What precautions should be taken to study the liberation of carbon dioxide gas during aerobic respiration ?,Precautions are : (i) Ensure that the experimental set-up is air-tight. (ii) KOH is corrosive. Handle it carefully.,"Name two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits and appliances.
 "
Why KOH solution is kept in the test-tube inside the air-tight conical flask while doing the experiment of respiration of seeds ?,KOH solution kept in the test-tube inside the airtight conical flask absorbs the evolved carbon dioxide released by germinating seeds thereby creating a partial vacuum in the conical flask. So an equal volume of water rises up in the tube. This indicates that the germinating seeds are actively respiring and evolving carbon dioxide gas during the process of respiration.,"Take a plastic mug. Drill two holes at its base and fit rubber stoppers in these holes. Insert carbon electrodes in these rubber stoppers as shown in Fig. 1.6. Connect these electrodes to a 6 volt battery.

Write two precautions to be taken while tracing the path of a ray of light passing through a rectangular glass slab for different angles of incidence.,"(i) The glass slab should be perfectly rectangular with all its faces smooth. (ii) While fixing the pins P1 and P2 or the pins P3 and P4, care should be taken to maintain a distance of about 5 cm between the two pins. This would help in tracing the direction of incident ray and that of emergent ray with greater accuracy.","Here PE is the incident ray, EF is the refracted ray and FS is the emergent ray. You may note that a ray of light is entering from air to glass at the first surface AB. The light ray on refraction has bent towards the normal. At the second surface AC, the light ray has entered from glass to air. Hence it has bent away from normal. Compare the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction at each refracting surface of the prism. Is this similar to the kind of bending that occurs in a glass slab? The peculiar shape of the prism makes the emergent ray bend at an angle to the direction of the incident ray. This angle is called the angle of deviation. In this case ∠D is the angle of deviation. Mark the angle of deviation in the above activity and measure it.
 Draw a thick straight line in ink, over a sheet of white paper placed on a Table. Place a glass slab over the line in such a way that one of its edges makes an angle with the line.

Next, place the glass slab such that it is normal to the line. What do you observe now? Does the part of the line under the glass slab appear bent? Look at the line from the top of the glass slab. Does the part of the line, beneath the slab, appear to be raised? Why does this happen?

Write two precautions to be taken while tracing the path of a ray of light passing through a rectangular glass prism.,"(i) While viewing the collinearity of pins and images, the eye should be kept at a distance from the pins so that all of them can be seen simultaneously. The collinearity of pins fixed on one side of the glass prism and the images of pins on the other side could also be confirmed by moving the head slightly to either side while viewing them. All the pins and images of pins would appear to move together if they are collinear. (ii) The pins P1, P2, P3 and P4 fixed on the paper may not be exactly perpendicular (or vertical) to the plane of paper. It is therefore desirable to look at the feet of the pins or their images while establishing their collinearity. That is why the position of each pin is marked with pointed tip of the pins on the paper.","Fix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using drawing pins. Place a rectangular glass slab over the sheet in the middle. Draw the outline of the slab with a pencil. Let us name the outline as ABCD. Take four identical pins. Fix two pins, say E and F, vertically such that the line joining the pins is inclined to the edge AB. Look for the images of the pins E and F through the opposite edge. Fix two other pins, say G and H, such that these pins and the images of E and F lie on a straight line. Remove the pins and the slab. Join the positions of tip of the pins E and F and produce the line up to AB. Let EF meet AB at O. Similarly, join the positions of tip of the pins G and H and produce it up to the edge CD. Let HG meet CD at O′. Join O and O′. Also produce EF up to P, as shown by a dotted line in Fig. 10.10.

 Think it over!
 Plants use completely different strategies for excretion than those of animals. Oxygen itself can be thought of as a waste product generated during photosynthesis! We have discussed earlier how plants deal with oxygen as well as CO2. They can get rid of excess water by transpiration. For other wastes, plants use the fact that many of their tissues consist of dead cells, and that they can even lose some parts such as leaves. Many plant waste products are stored in cellular vacuoles. Waste products may be stored in leaves that fall off. Other waste products are stored as resins and gums, especially in old xylem. Plants also excrete some waste substances into the soil around them.

Zn + CuSO4 → ZnSO4 + Cu","Take a small amount of copper oxide in a beaker and add dilute hydrochloric acid slowly while stirring. Note the colour of the solution. What has happened to the copper oxide?
 You will notice that the colour of the solution becomes blue-green and the copper oxide dissolves. The blue-green colour of the solution is due to the formation of copper(II) chloride in the reaction. The general reaction between a metal oxide and an acid can be written as – Metal oxide + Acid → Salt + Water

The solution of copper sulphate fades and finally becomes light green on dipping a rod made up of ________. Explain.,"The solution of copper sulphate fades and finally becomes light green on dipping a rod made up of iron. When an iron nail is dipped in CuSO4 solution, a brown coating of Cu is formed on the surface of iron and the colour of CuSO4 solution changes for blue to light green. This reaction shows that Fe is more reactive than copper as it displaces copper from its solution and green colour FeSO4 solution is formed.","Figure 1.8 (b) Iron nails and copper sulphate solutions compared before and after the experiment
 Why does the iron nail become brownish in colour and the blue colour of copper sulphate solution fades? The following chemical reaction takes place in this Activity– Fe(s) + CuSO4(aq) → (Copper sulphate)

"A student added a piece of zinc metal to four test-tubes I, II, III, IV which respectively contain aqueous solution of aluminium sulphate, zinc sulphate, ferrous sulphate and copper sulphate. In which solution the reaction will take place.",The reaction will take place in solution- III and IV. Zn will react with ferrous sulphate and copper sulphate. Zn + CuSO4 → ZnSO4 + Cu : Zn > Cu Zn + FeSO4 → ZnSO4 + Fe : Zn > Fe,"In this reaction, iron has displaced or removed another element, copper, from copper sulphate solution. This reaction is known as displacement reaction. Other examples of displacement reactions are Zn(s) + CuSO4(aq) → ZnSO4(aq) + Cu(s) (1.25) (Copper sulphate)
