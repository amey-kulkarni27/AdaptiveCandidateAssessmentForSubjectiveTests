Examine the elements of the third period and classify them as metals or non-metals. Comment on the metallic and non-metallic character of the third period. Name the most metallic element and non-metallic element of this period.,"Na (Sodium), Mg (Magnesium) and Al(Aluminium) are metals. Si (Silicon) is a metalloid. P (Phosphorus), S (Sulphur) and Cl (Chlorine) are non-metals. As we go from left to right across the third period, metallic character decreases and non-metallic character increases. The most metallic element in the third period is Na and the most non-metallic element is Cl.","Examine elements of the third period and classify them as metals and non-metals. On which side of the Periodic Table do you find the metals? On which side of the Periodic Table do you find the non-metals?
 As we can see, the metals like Na and Mg are towards the left-hand side of the Periodic Table while the non-metals like sulphur and chlorine are found on the right-hand side. In the middle, we have silicon, which is classified as a semi-metal or metalloid because it exhibits some properties of both metals and non-metals. In the Modern Periodic Table, a zig-zag line separates metals from non-metals. The borderline elements – boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, tellurium and polonium – are intermediate in properties and are called metalloids or semi-metals. As you have seen in Chapter 3, metals tend to lose electrons while forming bonds, that is, they are electropositive in nature.

Write down their electronic configurations. Do these elements also contain the same number of valence electrons? Do they contain the same number of shells?
 You will find that these elements of second period do not have the same number of valence electrons, but they contain the same number of shells. You also observe that the number of valence shell electrons increases by one unit, as the atomic number increases by one unit on moving from left to right in a period. Or we can say that atoms of different elements with the same number of occupied shells are placed in the same period. Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl and Ar belong to the third period of the Modern Periodic Table, since the electrons in the atoms of these elements are filled in K, L and M shells.

(a) Draw a diagram of cross-section of the human heart and label the following parts : (i)		 Right ventricle 		(ii) Aorta 		(iii) Left atrium 		(iv) Pulmonary arteries. (b) Give reasons for the following : (i) The muscular walls of ventricles are thicker than the walls of atria. (ii) Arteries have thick elastic walls.		 Aorta,(a) Pulmonary arteries Vena Cava from upper body Pulmonary veins Right atrium Left atrium Vena Cava from lower body Right ventricle Left ventricle Septum (Dividing wall) (b) (i) As ventricle have to pump blood into various organs. (ii) Since the blood emerges from the heart under high pressure. (b) (i),"Our pump — the heart The heart is a muscular organ which is as big as our fist (Fig. 6.10). Because both oxygen and carbon dioxide have to be transported by the blood, the heart has different chambers to prevent the oxygen-rich blood from mixing with the blood containing carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide-rich blood has to reach the lungs for the carbon dioxide to be removed, and the oxygenated blood from the lungs has to be brought back to the heart. This oxygen-rich blood is then pumped to the rest of the body. We can follow this process step by step (Fig. 6.11). Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs comes to the thin-walled upper chamber of the heart on the left, the left atrium. The left atrium relaxes when it is collecting this blood. It then contracts, while the next chamber, the left ventricle, relaxes, so that the blood is transferred to it. When the muscular left ventricle contracts in its turn, the blood is pumped out to the body. De-oxygenated blood comes from the body to the upper chamber on the right, the right atrium, as it relaxes. As the right atrium contracts, the corresponding lower chamber, the right ventricle, dilates. This transfers blood to the right ventricle, which in turn pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation. Since ventricles have to pump blood into various organs, they have thicker muscular walls than the atria do. Valves ensure that blood does not flow backwards when the atria or ventricles contract.

"(a) State two advantages of transpiration to the plant body. (b) (i) List in tabular form, two ways in which ‘transpiration’ is different from ‘translocation.’ (ii) Why do plants have a slow transport system ?","(a) Two advantages : (i) Helps in absorption and upward movement of water and minerals from roots to the leaves. (ii) Temperature regulation. S. No. Transpiration Translocation (i) Plays role in transport of water and minerals It is a transport of soluble products of photosynthesis. (ii) Occurs through xylem by simple physical forces. Occurs through phloem in the form of sucrose by utilising energy.  (ii) Because plants have a large proportion of dead cells in many tissues, they have low energy needs. So they use a slow transport system.","6.4.2 Transportation in Plants We have discussed earlier how plants take in simple compounds such as CO2 and photosynthesise energy stored in their chlorophyll-containing organs, namely leaves. The other kinds of raw materials needed for building plant bodies will also have to be taken up separately. For plants, the soil is the nearest and richest source of raw materials like nitrogen, phosphorus and other minerals. The absorption of these substances therefore occurs through the part in contact with the soil, namely roots. If the distances between soil-contacting organs and chlorophyllcontaining organs are small, energy and raw materials can easily diffuse to all parts of the plant body. But if these distances become large because of changes in plant body design, diffusion processes will not be sufficient to provide raw material in leaves and energy in roots. A proper system of transportation is therefore essential in such situations. Energy needs differ between different body designs. Plants do not move, and plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells in many tissues. As a result, plants have low energy needs, and can use relatively slow transport systems. The distances over which transport systems have to operate, however, can be very large in plants such as very tall trees. Plant transport systems will move energy stores from leaves and raw materials from roots. These two pathways are constructed as independently organised conducting tubes. One, the xylem moves water and minerals obtained from the soil. The other, phloem transports products of photosynthesis from the leaves where they are synthesised to other parts of the plant. We have studied the structure of these tissues in detail in Class IX. Transport of water In xylem tissue, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are interconnected to form a continuous system of water-conducting channels reaching all parts of the plant. At the roots, cells in contact with the soil actively take up ions. This creates a difference in the concentration of these ions between the root and the soil. Water, therefore,

Soaps and detergents are both types of salts. State the difference between the two. Write the mechanism of the cleansing action of soaps. Why do soaps not form lather (foam) with hard water ? Mention any two problems that arise due to the use of detergents instead of soaps.  (),"Soaps are the sodium or potassium salts of long chain carboxylic acids while detergents are the ammonium of sulphonate salts of long chain carboxylic acids.  The dirt is oily in nature and when soap is added to water, its molecules form structures called micelles in which carbon chain of the molecules dissolves in the oil while the ionic end dissolves in water and faces outside. The micelles thus help in dissolving the dirt in water. (Note : 1 mark to be awarded if only labelled diagram of micelle is given)  Ca2+ and Mg2+ present in hard water form insoluble substance (scum) with soap.  Two problems : (i) Non-biodegradable (ii) Water pollution / soil pollution 		 (Note : 1 mark to be awarded for any one of the problems.)

(iv) They take time to They dissolve dissolve in water. faster in water. Cleansing Action of Soap : When soap is dissolved in water, it forms a colloidal suspension. In this colloidal suspension, the soap molecules cluster together to form micelles and remain radially suspended in water with the hydrocarbon end towards the centre and the ionic end directed outward. The dirt particles always adhere to the oily or greasy layer present on the skin or clothes. When a dirty cloth is dipped into a soap solution, its nonpolar hydrocarbon end of micelles gets attached to the grease or oil present in dirt and polar end remains in water layer. The mechanical action of rubbing subsequently dislodges the oily layer from the dirty surface shaping it into small globules. A stable emulsion of oil in water is formed. The emulsified oil or grease globules bearing the dirt can now be readily washed with water. Soaps do not form lather when the water is hard. When soap is added to hard water, calcium and magnesium salts present in water displace sodium or potassium ions from the soap molecules forming an insoluble substance called scum. Problems that aries due to use of detergents instead of soap : (i) Detergents being non-biodegradable, they accumulate in the environment causing pollution. (ii) In soil, the presence of detergents leads to pH changes making soil infertile. (iii) The entry of detergents into food chain leads to bioaccumulation in living beings and tends toward serious health issues.

The molecules of soap are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic acids. The ionic-end of soap interacts with water while the carbon chain interacts with oil. The soap molecules, thus form structures called micelles (see Fig. 4.12) where one end of the molecules is towards the oil droplet while the ionic-end faces outside. This forms an emulsion in water. The soap micelle thus helps in pulling out the dirt in water and we can wash our clothes clean (Fig. 4.13). Can you draw the structure of the micelle that would be formed if you dissolve soap in a hydrocarbon?

 Micelles Soaps are molecules in which the two ends have differing properties, one is hydrophilic, that is, it interacts with water, while the other end is hydrophobic, that is, it interacts with hydrocarbons. When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic ‘tail’ of soap will not be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the ionic end in water and the hydrocarbon ‘tail’ protruding out of water. Inside water,

Inside water,
 these molecules have a unique orientation that keeps the hydrocarbon portion out of the water. Thus, clusters of molecules in which the hydrophobic tails are in the interior of the cluster and the ionic ends are on the surface of the cluster. This formation is called a micelle. Soap in the form of a micelle is able to clean, since the oily dirt will be collected in the centre of the micelle. The micelles stay in solution as a colloid and will not come together to precipitate because of ion-ion repulsion. Thus, the dirt suspended in the micelles is also easily rinsed away. The soap micelles are large enough to scatter light. Hence a soap solution appears cloudy. Figure 4.13 Effect of soap in cleaning
 Have you ever observed while bathing that foam is formed with difficulty and an insoluble substance (scum) remains after washing with water? This is caused by the reaction of soap with the calcium and magnesium salts, which cause the hardness of water. Hence you need to use a larger amount of soap. This problem is overcome by using another class of compounds called detergents as cleansing agents. Detergents are generally sodium salts of sulphonic acids or ammonium salts with chlorides or bromides ions, etc. Both have long hydrocarbon chain. The charged ends of these compounds do not form insoluble precipitates with the calcium and magnesium ions in hard water. Thus, they remain effective in hard water. Detergents are usually used to make shampoos and products for cleaning clothes.

Will a micelle be formed in other solvents such as ethanol also ? ,"(i) Soap molecules have two ends– one end is the hydrocarbon chain which is water repellent, where as the other end is the ionic part which it water soluble end. When soap is dissolved in water it forms a group of many molecules, known as micelle. (ii) These micelles are formed because their hydrocarbon chains come together and the polar ends are projected outwards. (iii) Micelle formation in ethanol will not occur because the hydrocarbon chain end of the soap will dissolve in ethanol.

 Generally, esters are sweet-smelling substances. These are used in making perfumes and as flavouring agents. On treating with sodium hydroxide, which is an alkali, the ester is converted back to alcohol and sodium salt of carboxylic acid. This reaction is known as saponification because it is used in the preparation of soap. Soaps are sodium or potassium salts of long chain carboxylic acid. 73

Substitution reaction — CH4 + Cl2 →CH3Cl + HCl one atom is replaced by another ; two products only, one product in addition reaction. 3 ","4.3.3 Addition Reaction Unsaturated hydrocarbons add hydrogen in the presence of catalysts such as palladium or nickel to give saturated hydrocarbons. Catalysts are substances that cause a reaction to occur or proceed at a different rate without the reaction itself being affected. This reaction is commonly used in the hydrogenation of vegetable oils using a nickel catalyst. Vegetable oils generally have long unsaturated carbon chains while animal fats have saturated carbon chains.
 You must have seen advertisements stating that some vegetable oils are ‘healthy’. Animal fats generally contain saturated fatty acids which are said to be harmful for health. Oils containing unsaturated fatty acids should be chosen for cooking.
 4.3.4 Substitution Reaction Saturated hydrocarbons are fairly unreactive and are inert in the presence of most reagents. However, in the presence of sunlight, chlorine is added to hydrocarbons in a very fast reaction. Chlorine can replace the hydrogen atoms one by one. It is called a substitution reaction because one type of atom or a group of atoms takes the place of another. A number of products are usually formed with the higher homologues of alkanes.

Make the structure of methane by showing sharing of electrons between carbon and hydrogen atoms. How could you convert methane into chloroform by substitution reaction? Explain with the help of chemical reactions. ,"Methane, CH4 Hydrogen atoms can form one covalent bond, while carbon atoms can form four covalent bonds. Four pairs of electrons are shared in a methane molecule (CH4). When a mixture of methane and chlorine is exposed to ultraviolet light - typically sunlighta substitution reaction occurs and the organic product formed is chloromethane. CH4 + Cl2 → CH3Cl + HCl However, the reaction doesn’t stop there, and all the hydrogens in the methane can in turn be replaced by chlorine atoms.

However, in the presence of sunlight, chlorine is added to hydrocarbons in a very fast reaction. Chlorine can replace the hydrogen atoms one by one. It is called a substitution reaction because one type of atom or a group of atoms takes the place of another. A number of products are usually formed with the higher homologues of alkanes.

(ii) Helps in filtering out nitrogenous waste like urea from blood. ,"The excretory system of human beings (Fig. 6.13) includes a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary bladder and a urethra. Kidneys are located in the abdomen, one on either side of the backbone. Urine produced in the kidneys passes through the ureters into the urinary bladder where it is stored until it is released through the urethra. How is urine produced? The purpose of making urine is to filter out waste products from the blood. Just as CO2 is removed from the blood in the lungs, nitrogenous waste such as urea or uric acid are removed from blood in the kidneys. It is then no surprise that the basic filtration unit in the kidneys,
 like in the lungs, is a cluster of very thin-walled blood capillaries. Each capillary cluster in the kidney is associated with the cup-shaped end of a coiled tube called Bowman’s capsule that collects the filtrate (Fig. 6.14). Each kidney has large numbers of these filtration units called nephrons packed close together. Some substances in the initial filtrate, such as glucose, amino acids, salts and a major amount of water, are selectively re-absorbed as the urine flows along the tube. The amount of water re-absorbed depends on how much excess water there is in the body, and on how much of dissolved waste there is to be excreted. The urine forming in each kidney eventually enters a long tube, the ureter, which connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder. Urine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure of the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out through the urethra. The bladder is muscular, so it is under nervous control, as we have discussed elsewhere. As a result, we can usually control the urge to urinate.

Artificial kidneys contain a number of tubes with a semi-permeable lining, suspended in a tank filled with dialysing fluid.

During this passage, the waste products from the blood pass into dialysing fluid by diffusion. The purified blood is pumped back into the patient.

(ii) The raw materials required for this process are carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll. (iii) Carbon dioxide enters into the leaves through stomata and cells of the roots absorbs water from the soil.

The following events occur during this process – (i) Absorption of light energy by chlorophyll. (ii) Conversion of light energy to chemical energy and splitting of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. (iii) Reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. These steps need not take place one after the other immediately. For example, desert plants take up carbon dioxide at night and prepare an intermediate which is acted upon by the energy absorbed by the chlorophyll during the day. Let us see how each of the components of the above reaction are necessary for photosynthesis. If you carefully observe a cross-section of a leaf under the microscope (shown in Fig. 6.1), you will notice that some cells contain green dots. These green dots are cell organelles called chloroplasts which contain chlorophyll. Let us do an activity which demonstrates that chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis.

As soon as Amoeba comes in contact with a food particle or prey, it throws pseudopodia all around the food particle. The tips of encircling pseudopodia fuse and the prey comes to lie in a vesicle or phagosome. This method of intake of food is called circumvallation. Amoeba can also ingest food by other methods like import circumfluence and invagination. (c) In paramecium, the food is taken in at a specific spot and is moved to this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface of the cell.  1 + 3 + 1","6.2.2 Heterotrophic Nutrition Each organism is adapted to its environment. The form of nutrition differs depending on the type and availability of food material as well as how it is obtained by the organism. For example, whether the food source is stationary (such as grass) or mobile (such as a deer), would allow for differences in how the food is accessed and what is the nutritive apparatus used by a cow and a lion. There is a range of strategies by which the food is taken in and used by the organism. Some organisms break-down the food material outside the body and then absorb it. Examples are fungi like bread moulds, yeast and mushrooms. Others take in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can be taken in and broken down depends on the body design and functioning. Some other organisms derive nutrition from plants or animals without killing them. This parasitic nutritive strategy is used by a wide variety of organisms like cuscuta (amar-bel), ticks, lice, leeches and tape-worms.
 6.2.3 How do Organisms obtain their Nutrition? Since the food and the way it is obtained differ, the digestive system is different in various organisms. In single-celled organisms, the food may be taken in by the entire surface. But as the complexity of the organism increases, different parts become specialised to perform different functions. For example, Amoeba takes in food using temporary finger-like extensions of the cell surface which fuse over the food particle forming a food-vacuole (Fig. 6.5). Inside the foodvacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones which then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested material is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In Paramoecium, which is also a unicellular organism, the cell has a definite shape and food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved to this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface of the cell. Figure 6.5 Nutrition in Amoeba

On selfing F1, the hidden characters reappeared in just 25% of the offsprings and the other 75% shared the characters expressed in F1. Mendel concluded that the character which expresses itself in F1 and in 75% of the individuals of F2 is dominating while the other is recessive .(Or same thing can be explained by using an example) ","Gregor Johann Mendel (1822–1884) Mendel was educated in a monastery and went on to study science and mathematics at the University of Vienna. Failure in the examinations for a teaching certificate did not suppress his zeal for scientific quest. He went back to his monastery and started growing peas. Many others had studied the inheritance of traits in peas and other organisms earlier, but Mendel blended his knowledge of science and mathematics and was the first one to keep count of individuals exhibiting a particular trait in each generation. This helped him to arrive at the laws of inheritance.
 Figure 9.3 Inheritance of traits over two generations
 Mendel used a number of contrasting visible characters of garden peas – round/wrinkled seeds, tall/short plants, white/violet flowers and so on. He took pea plants with different characteristics – a tall plant and a short plant, produced progeny by crossing them, and calculated the percentages of tall or short progeny. In the first place, there were no halfway characteristics in this firstgeneration, or F1 progeny – no ‘medium-height’ plants. All plants were tall. This meant that only one of the parental traits was seen, not some mixture of the two. So the next question was, were the tall plants in the F1 generation exactly the same as the tall plants of the parent generation? Mendelian experiments test this by getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall plants to reproduce by self-pollination. The progeny of the parental plants are, of course, all tall. However, the second-generation, or F2, progeny of the F1 tall plants are not all tall. Instead, one quarter of them are short. This indicates that both the tallness and shortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants, but only the tallness trait was expressed. This led Mendel to propose that two copies of factor (now called genes) controlling traits are present in sexually reproducing organism. These two may be identical, or may be different, depending on the parentage. A pattern of inheritance can be worked out with this assumption, as shown in Fig. 9.3.

"With the help of one example for each, distinguish between the acquired traits and the inherited traits., Why are the traits/experiences acquired during the entire lifetime of an individual not inherited in the next generation ? Explain the reason of this fact with an example. ","l Acquired traits : Traits which develop in the life time of an individual and do not pass to the progeny. Example : Learning a skill such as dance/music/loss of body parts/weight/any other example. l Inherited traits : Traits present in the gamete/germ cells which can be seen in the progeny. Example : Skin colour/eyebrows/any other example. l Reason : Traits/characteristics acquired during one’s life time do not bring any change in the DNA of the reproducing cells/germ cells. Example : Decrease in body weight of beetles due to starvation do not pass on to the next generation because there is no change in the germ, cells of beetles.   Detailed Answer : Acquired traits are the characters that are acquired by the individual during its lifetime. These traits cannot be inherited. For example, if a wrestler develops large muscles due to his training program that does not mean it will be passed on to his offspring. Inherited traits are the characters which are inherited by the offspring from the parents. These traits are expressed in the offspring and later carried on to the next generation. For example skin colour, eye colour and shape. Acquired traits occur due to changes in the lifestyles, injury, loss of body parts, disuse of some body parts. These traits/experiences occur in the somatic cells which do not evolve germ cells and genetic materials. Therefore, these traits are not transferred or inherited in the next generation. Example, low weight of a starving beetle. 5","Why are traits acquired during the life-time of an individual not inherited?

Acquired Traits are the traits which an organism acquires in life time. (iii) Formation of new species from the existing ones is called speciation. Factors which could lead to the rise of new species are : geographical isolation, genetic drift, natural selection.","Variations arising during the process of reproduction can be inherited. These variations may lead to increased survival of the individuals. Sexually reproducing individuals have two copies of genes for the same trait. If the copies are not identical, the trait that gets expressed is called the dominant trait and the other is called the recessive trait. Traits in one individual may be inherited separately, giving rise to new combinations of traits in the offspring of sexual reproduction. Sex is determined by different factors in various species. In human beings, the sex of the child depends on whether the paternal chromosome is X (for girls) or Y (for boys). Variations in the species may confer survival advantages or merely contribute to the genetic drift. Changes in the non-reproductive tissues caused by environmental factors are not inheritable. Speciation may take place when variation is combined with geographical isolation. Evolutionary relationships are traced in the classification of organisms. Tracing common ancestors back in time leads us to the idea that at some point of time, non-living material must have given rise to life. Evolution can be worked out by the study of not just living species, but also fossils. Complex organs may have evolved because of the survival advantage of even the intermediate stages. Organs or features may be adapted to new functions during the course of evolution. For example, feathers are thought to have been initially evolved for warmth and later adapted for flight.

Recessive trait is a genetic trait that is expressed only when two copies of the gene are present.","In this explanation, both TT and Tt are tall plants, while only tt is a short plant. In other words, a single copy of ‘T’ is enough to make the plant tall, while both copies have to be ‘t’ for the plant to be short.

(iii) Sex chromosome is either a pair of chromosomes, usually designated X or Y, in the germ cells of most animals, that combine to determine the sex and sexlinked characteristics of an individual.","Variations arising during the process of reproduction can be inherited. These variations may lead to increased survival of the individuals. Sexually reproducing individuals have two copies of genes for the same trait. If the copies are not identical, the trait that gets expressed is called the dominant trait and the other is called the recessive trait. Traits in one individual may be inherited separately, giving rise to new combinations of traits in the offspring of sexual reproduction. Sex is determined by different factors in various species. In human beings, the sex of the child depends on whether the paternal chromosome is X (for girls) or Y (for boys). Variations in the species may confer survival advantages or merely contribute to the genetic drift. Changes in the non-reproductive tissues caused by environmental factors are not inheritable. Speciation may take place when variation is combined with geographical isolation. Evolutionary relationships are traced in the classification of organisms. Tracing common ancestors back in time leads us to the idea that at some point of time, non-living material must have given rise to life. Evolution can be worked out by the study of not just living species, but also fossils. Complex organs may have evolved because of the survival advantage of even the intermediate stages. Organs or features may be adapted to new functions during the course of evolution. For example, feathers are thought to have been initially evolved for warmth and later adapted for flight.

(iv) Forests are sites for fishing and hunting. (v) Also they gather fruits, nuts and medicines from the forests.","Make a list of forest produce that you use. What do you think a person living near a forest would use? What do you think a person living in a forest would use? Discuss with your classmates how these needs differ or do not differ and the reasons for the same.
 We all use various forest produce. But our dependency on forest resources varies. Some of us have access to alternatives, some do not. When we consider the conservation of forests, we need to look at the stakeholders who are – (i) the people who live in or around forests are dependent on forest produce for various aspects of their life (see Fig. 16.2). (ii) the Forest Department of the Government which owns the land and controls the resources from forests. (iii) the industrialists – from those who use ‘tendu’ leaves to make bidis to the ones with paper mills – who use various forest produce, but are not dependent on the forests in any one area. (iv) the wildlife and nature enthusiasts who want to conserve nature in its pristine form.
 Let us take a look at what each of these groups needs/gets out of the forests. The local people need large quantities of firewood, small timber and thatch. Bamboo is used to make slats for huts, and baskets for collecting and storing food materials. Implements for agriculture, fishing and hunting are largely made of wood, also forests are sites for fishing and hunting. In addition to the people gathering fruits, nuts and medicines from the forests, their cattle also graze in forest areas or feed on the fodder which is collected from forests. Do you think such use of forest resources would lead to the exhaustion of these resources? Do not forget that before the British came and took over most of our forest areas, people had been living in these forests for centuries. They had developed practices to ensure that the resources were used in a sustainable manner. After the British took control of the forests (which they exploited ruthlessly for their own purposes), these people were forced to depend on much smaller areas and forest resources started becoming over-exploited to some extent. The Forest Department in independent India took over from the British but local knowledge and local needs continued to be ignored in the management practices. Thus vast tracts of forests have been converted to monocultures of pine, teak or eucalyptus. In order to plant these trees, huge areas are first cleared of all vegetation. This destroys a large amount of biodiversity in the area. Not only this, the varied needs of the local people – leaves for fodder, herbs for medicines, fruits and nuts for food – can no longer be met from such forests. Such plantations are useful for the industries to access specific products and are an important source of revenue for the Forest Department. Do you know how many industries are based on forest produce? A short count reveals timber, paper, lac and sports equipment. Industries would consider the forest as merely a source of raw material for its factories. And huge interest-groups lobby the government for access to these raw materials at artificially low rates. Since these industries have a greater reach than the local people, they are not interested in the sustainability of the forest in one particular area. For example, after cutting down all the teak trees in one area, they will get their teak from a forest farther away. They do not have any stake in ensuring that one particular area should yield an optimal amount of some produce for all generations to come. What do you think will stop the local people in behaving in a similar manner?

What is speciation ? What are the factors that lead to speciation ? Explain any two factors. ,"(a) It is an evolutionary process by which new species arise. Factors : 			(i) Geographical isolation 			(ii) Genetic drift 			(iii) Natural selection (b) (Any two with explanation) (i)		 Genetic Drift : It is the random change in the frequency of alleles in a population over successive generations due to sampling error in the gametes. Each new generation differs from its parental generation with regard to the allele frequencies simply because of random variation in the distribution of gametes. This process is more rapid in smaller population, hence genetic drift can cause less of genetic diversity if there are no counteracting factors. 1½ (ii)		 Natural Selection : It is the process, according to Darwin, which brings about the evolution of new species of animals and plants. Darwin found that variations existed between individuals of the population and concluded that disease, competition and other forces acting on the population eliminated those individuals which are less well adapted to their environment. The surviving population would pass the hereditary advantageous characteristic to their offsprings.  1½+1½","progeny beetles are green. Crows cannot see green-coloured beetles on the green leaves of the bushes, and therefore cannot eat them. What happens then? The progeny of green beetles is not eaten, while the progeny of red beetles continues to be eaten. As a result, there are more and more green beetles than red ones in the beetle population. In a second situation, again, a colour variation arises during reproduction, but now it results in a beetle that is blue in colour instead of red. This beetle can also pass the colour on to its progeny, so that all its progeny beetles are blue. Crows can see blue-coloured beetles in the green leaves of the bushes as well as they can see red ones, and therefore can eat them. What happens initially? In the population, as it expands, there are a few blue beetles, but most are red. But at this point, an elephant comes by, and stamps on the bushes where the beetles live. This kills most of the beetles. By chance, the few beetles that have survived are mostly blue. The beetle population slowly expands again, but now, the beetles in the population are mostly blue. It is obvious that in both situations, what started out as a rare variation came to be a common characteristic in the population. In other words, the frequency of an inherited trait changed over generations. Since genes control traits, we can say that the frequency of certain genes in a population changed over generations. This is the essence of the idea of evolution. But there are interesting differences, too, in the two situations. In the first case, the variation became common because it gave a survival advantage. In other words, it was naturally selected. We can see that the natural selection is exerted by the crows. The more crows there are, the more red beetles would be eaten, and the more the proportion of green beetles in the population would be. Thus, natural selection is directing evolution in the beetle population. It results in adaptations in the beetle population to fit their environment better. In the second situation, the colour change gave no survival advantage. Instead, it was simply a matter of accidental survival of beetles of one colour that changed the common characteristic of the resultant population. The elephant would not have caused such major havoc in the beetle population if the beetle population had been very large. So, accidents in small populations can change the frequency of some genes in a population, even if they give no survival advantage. This is the notion of genetic drift, which provides diversity without any adaptations. Now consider a third situation. In this, as the beetle population begins to expand, the bushes start suffering from a plant disease. The amount of leaf material for the beetles is reduced. The beetles are poorly nourished as a result. The average weight of adult beetles decreases from what it used to be when leaves were plentiful, but there is no genetic change occurring. After a few years and a few beetle generations of such scarcity, the plant disease is eliminated. There is a lot of leaf food. At this time, what would we expect the weight of the beetles to be?

What are fossils ? How are they formed ? List two methods of determining the age of fossils. Explain in brief the importance of fossils in deciding the evolutionary relationships.  Explain the importance of fossils in deciding evolutionary relationships. ,"(i) Fossils : The remains/impression of dead / decayed plants / animals.

(v) Fossil also helps in the determination of the connecting links between various groups and their origin from the primitive ones.","How do we know how old the fossils are? There are two components to this estimation. One is relative. If we dig into the earth and start finding fossils, it is reasonable to suppose that the fossils we find closer to the surface are more recent than the fossils we find in deeper layers. The second way of dating fossils is by detecting the ratios of different isotopes of the same element in the fossil material. It would be interesting to find out exactly how this method works!
 How do fossils form layer by layer? Let us start 100 million years ago. Some invertebrates on the sea-bed die, and are buried in the sand. More sand accumulates, and sandstone forms under pressure.

What evidence do we have for the origin of life from inanimate matter ? ,"J.B.S. Haldane suggested that life must have developed from the simple inorganic molecules which were present on earth soon after it was formed. He speculated that the conditions on earth at that time could have given rise to more complex organic molecules that were necessary for life. The first primitive organisms would arise from further chemical synthesis. Later, Stanley L. Miller and Harold C. Urey conducted experiment to find out about the origin of organic molecules. They assembled an atmosphere similar to that thought to exist on early earth (molecules like ammonia, methane and hydrogen sulphide, but no oxygen over water). This was maintained at a temperature just below 100ºC and sparks were passed through the mixture of gases to stimulate lightning. At the end of a week, 15% of the carbon had been converted to simple compounds of carbon including amino acids which make up protein molecules. 1","Organic compounds The two characteristic features seen in carbon, that is, tetravalency and catenation, put together give rise to a large number of compounds. Many have the same non-carbon atom or group of atoms attached to different carbon chains. These compounds were initially extracted from natural substances and it was thought that these carbon compounds or organic compounds could only be formed within a living system. That is, it was postulated that a ‘vital force’ was necessary for their synthesis. Friedrich Wöhler disproved this in 1828 by preparing urea from ammonium cyanate. But carbon compounds, except for carbides, oxides of carbon, carbonate and hydrogencarbonate salts continue to be studied under organic chemistry.
 4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds We have already seen the structure of methane. Another compound formed between carbon and hydrogen is ethane with a formula of C2H6. In order to arrive at the structure of simple carbon compounds, the first step is to link the carbon atoms together with a single bond (Fig. 4.6a) and then use the hydrogen atoms to satisfy the remaining valencies of carbon (Fig. 4.6b). For example, the structure of ethane is arrived in the following steps – C—C
 J.B.S. Haldane, a British scientist (who became a citizen of India later), suggested in 1929 that life must have developed from the simple inorganic molecules which were present on earth soon after it was formed. He speculated that the conditions on earth at that time, which were far from the conditions we see today, could have given rise to more complex organic molecules that were necessary for life. The first primitive organisms would arise from further chemical synthesis. How did these organic molecules arise? An answer was suggested by the experiment conducted by Stanley L. Miller and Harold C. Urey in 1953. They assembled an atmosphere similar to that thought to exist on early earth (this had molecules like ammonia, methane and hydrogen sulphide, but no oxygen) over water. This was maintained at a temperature just below 100°C and sparks were passed through the mixture of gases to simulate lightning. At the end of a week, 15% of the carbon (from methane) had been converted to simple compounds of carbon including amino acids which make up protein molecules. So, can life arise afresh on earth even now?

"A particular species ‘X’ has more common characteristics with species ‘Y’, whereas another species ‘Z’ has less common characteristics with species ‘Y’. Which two species are more closely related ? Why ? On what basis are the eukaryotic organisms further classified ? Why is this basis important ? What is the importance of homologous organs ?","Species ‘X’ is more closely related with species ‘Y’. 1 The more closely related species will have more characteristics in common. Hence species X and Y are closely related. Eukaryotic organisms are further classified on the basis of whether they are unicellular or multicellular. This basis marks a very fundamental difference in body design, because of specialisation of cell types and tissues. Homologous organs help to identify an evolutionary relationship between apparently different species. This is how life originated from inanimate matter.","Some basic characteristics will be shared by most organisms. The cell is the basic unit of life in all organisms. The characteristics in the next level of classification would be shared by most, but not all organisms. A basic characteristic of cell design that differs among different organisms is whether the cell has a nucleus. Bacterial cells do not, while the cells of most other organisms do. Among organisms with nucleated cells, which ones are unicellular and which ones multi-cellular? That property marks a very basic difference in body design, because of specialisation of cell types and tissues. Among multi-cellular organisms, whether they can undertake photosynthesis or not will provide the next level of classification. Among the multi-cellular organisms that cannot do photosynthesis, whether the skeleton is inside the body or around the body will mark another fundamental design difference. We can see that, even in these few questions that we have asked, a hierarchy is developing that allows us to make classification groups. The more characteristics two species will have in common, the more closely they are related. And the more closely they are related, the more recently they will have had a common ancestor. An example will help. A brother and a sister are closely related. They have common ancestors in the first generation before them, namely, their parents. A girl and her first cousin are also related, but less than the girl and her brother. This is because cousins have common ancestors, their grandparents, in the second generation before them, not in the first one. We can now appreciate that classification of species is in fact a reflection of their evolutionary relationship. We can thus build up small groups of species with recent common ancestors, then super-groups of these groups with more distant common ancestors, and so on. In theory, we can keep going backwards like this until we come to the notion of a single species at the very beginning of evolutionary time. If that is the case, then at some point in the history of the earth, non-living material must have given rise to life. There are many theories about how this might have happened. It would be interesting to come up with theories of our own!

(iv) Corrosion of iron is a serious problem because it leads to wastage of tonnes of iron every year and lot of money is spent to repair or replace it. (v) The iron articles should be painted.","The rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing, galvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys. Galvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting by coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is protected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you reason this out? Alloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal. We can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is the most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is because pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is mixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard and strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get stainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed with some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties of any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance. The substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a homogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a nonmetal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then, dissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled to room temperature.

(b) (i) There is deflection in galvanometer connected with coils, due to induced current. 		(ii) Deflection becomes zero. 		(iii) Deflection in galvanometer is in opposite direction. Reason : (i) E.M. induction takes place because field is changing. (ii) Since current becomes stationary, no change in field takes place. So no EM induction. (iii) E.M. induction takes place but induced current is in opposite direction. ","In this activity we observe that as soon as the current in coil-1 reaches either a steady value or zero, the galvanometer in coil-2 shows no deflection. From these observations, we conclude that a potential difference is induced in the coil-2 whenever the electric current through the coil–1 is changing (starting or stopping). Coil-1 is called the primary coil and coil-2 is called the secondary coil. As the current in the first coil changes, the magnetic field associated with it also changes. Thus the magnetic field lines around the secondary coil also change. Hence the change in magnetic field lines associated with the secondary coil is the cause of induced electric current in it. This process, by which a changing magnetic field in a conductor induces a current in another conductor, is called electromagnetic induction. In practice we can induce current in a coil either by moving it in a magnetic field or by changing the magnetic field around it. It is convenient in most situations to move the coil in a magnetic field. The induced current is found to be the highest when the direction of motion of the coil is at right angles to the magnetic field. In this situation, we can use a simple rule to know the direction of the induced current. Stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of right hand so that they are perpendicular to each other, as shown in Fig. 13.18. If the forefinger indicates the direction of the magnetic field and the thumb shows the direction of motion of conductor, then the middle finger will show the direction Figure 13.18 of induced current. This simple rule is called Fleming’s Fleming’s right-hand rule right-hand rule.

If the coil is placed near to a current-carrying conductor, the magnetic field may change either due to a change in the current through the conductor or due to the relative motion between the coil and conductor. The direction of the induced current is given by the Fleming’s right-hand rule.

One of the wires in this supply, usually with red insulation cover, is called live wire (or positive). Another wire, with black insulation, is called neutral wire (or negative). In our country, the potential difference between the two is 220 V. At the meter-board in the house, these wires pass into an electricity meter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are connected to the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separate circuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of 15 A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as geysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5 A current rating for bulbs, fans, etc. The earth wire, which has insulation of green colour, is usually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house. This is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that have a metallic body, for example, electric press, toaster, table fan, refrigerator, etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which provides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it ensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance keeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe electric shock.
 In our houses we receive AC electric power of 220 V with a frequency of 50 Hz. One of the wires in this supply is with red insulation, called live wire. The other one is of black insulation, which is a neutral wire. The potential difference between the two is 220 V. The third is the earth wire that has green insulation and this is connected to a metallic body deep inside earth. It is used as a safety measure to ensure that any leakage of current to a metallic body does not give any severe shock to a user.

It is said that a difference of 20°C in temperature of water at two levels can be exploited to generate electricity. Name the power plant that can be used for this purpose. Describe the process and give its main advantage.,"It is correct that a difference of 20°C in temperature of water at two levels can be exploited to generate electricity. For this purpose, Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) power plants are used. To use (5 marks) this plant, a difference of 20°C or more between the temperature of surface waters and water at depths of 1000 meters is required. In one of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion system, the warm surface water is used to boil low boiling liquid like ammonia, or a chlorofluorocarbon. The vapours of the liquid are then sent to move the turbines of generator. The cold water from the depths is used to cool the vapour escaped from the turbines and converted into liquid to be used again.","14.2.2 Thermal Power Plant Large amount of fossil fuels are burnt every day in power stations to heat up water to produce steam which further runs the turbine to generate electricity. The transmission of electricity is more efficient than transporting coal or petroleum over the same distance. Therefore, many thermal power plants are set up near coal or oil fields. The term thermal power plant is used since fuel is burnt to produce heat energy which is converted into electrical energy.
 14.2.3 Hydro Power Plants Another traditional source of energy was the kinetic energy of flowing water or the potential energy of water at a height. Hydro power plants convert the potential energy of falling water into electricity. Since there are very few water-falls which could be used as a source of potential energy, hydro power plants are associated with dams. In the last century, a large number of dams were built all over the world. As we can see from Fig. 14.1, a quarter of our energy requirement in India is met by hydro power plants.
 Ocean Thermal Energy The water at the surface of the sea or ocean is heated by the Sun while the water in deeper sections is relatively cold. This difference in temperature is exploited to obtain energy in ocean-thermal-energy conversion plants. These plants can operate if the temperature difference between the water at the surface and water at depths up to 2 km is 20 K (20°C) or more. The warm surface-water is used to boil a volatile liquid like ammonia. The vapours of the liquid are then used to run the turbine of generator. The cold water from the depth of the ocean is pumped up and condense vapour again to liquid. The energy potential from the sea (tidal energy, wave energy and ocean thermal energy) is quite large, but efficient commercial exploitation is difficult.
 14.3.3 Geothermal Energy Due to geological changes, molten rocks formed in the deeper hot regions of earth’s crust are pushed upward and trapped in certain regions called ‘hot spots’. When underground water comes in contact with the hot spot, steam is generated. Sometimes hot water from that region finds outlets at the surface. Such outlets are known as hot springs. The steam trapped in rocks is routed through a pipe to a turbine and used to generate electricity. The cost of production would not be much, but there are very few commercially viable sites where such energy can be exploited. There are number of power plants based on geothermal energy operational in New Zealand and United States of America.

(ii) The ratio of size of angle of incidence (i.e., sin i) to the sine of angle of refraction (i.e., sin r) is always constant for the light of given colour and for the given pair of media. sin i Mathematically, = constant = n2 sin r The constant 'n' is called refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first medium. Absolute refractive index of the medium is given by Speed of light in a vacuum (c ) n= Speed of light in medium (v ) (b) Given nA = 2.0 and nB = 1.5 		Speed of light in medium B = 2 × 108 m/s Speed of light in vacuum (c) nB = Speed of light in media B c 		Speed of light in vacuum c = 2 × 108 × 1.5 				= 3.0 × 108 m/s 		Speed of light in medium 'A' nA = Speed of light in vacuum Speed of light in medium 'A' Speed of light in media 'A' Speed of light in medium A = = 1.5 × 108 m/s","10.3.2 The Refractive Index You have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely from one transparent medium into another will change its direction in the second medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place in a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index, the “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(10.4). The refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity, the relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns out that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light travels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3×108 m s–1. In air, the speed of light is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces considerably in glass or water. The value of the refractive index for a given pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as given below. Consider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as shown in Fig.10.11. Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the speed of light in medium 2. The refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and the speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol n 21. This can be expressed in an equation form as n21=

It always lies inside the lens. A light beam passing through the optical centre emerges without any deviation. (ii) Centre of curvature : It is defined as the centre of the spheres of which the lens is originally a part of. Because the spherical lens consists of two spherical surfaces, the lens has two centres of curvature. (iv) Aperture : This is the length or breadth of the lens through which refraction takes place. (v) Principal focus : A light ray parallel to the principal axis of the lens meets at a point on the principal axis. This point is called the principal focus. (vi) Focal length : The distance of the point from the centre of lens or mirror at which a parallel ray of beam converge (or diverge) is called focal-length and the point is called focus.","10.3.3 Refraction by Spherical Lenses You might have seen watchmakers using a small magnifying glass to see tiny parts. Have you ever touched the surface of a magnifying glass with your hand? Is it plane surface or curved? Is it thicker in the middle or at the edges? The glasses used in spectacles and that by a watchmaker are examples of lenses. What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? We shall discuss these in this section. A transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both surfaces are spherical, forms a lens. This means that a lens is bound by at least one spherical surface. In such lenses, the other surface would be plane. A lens may have two spherical surfaces, bulging outwards. Such a lens is called a double convex lens. It is simply called a convex lens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to the edges. Convex lens converges light rays as shown in Fig. 10.12 (a). Hence convex lenses are (a) also called converging lenses. Similarly, a double concave lens is bounded by two spherical surfaces, curved inwards. It is thicker at the edges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge light rays as shown in Fig. 10.12 (b). Such lenses are also called diverging lenses. A double concave lens is simply called a concave lens. A lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens, has two spherical surfaces. Each of these surfaces (b) forms a part of a sphere. The centres of these Figure 10.12 spheres are called centres of curvature of the lens. (a) Converging action of a convex lens, (b) diverging The centre of curvature of a lens is usually action of a concave lens represented by the letter C.

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between an acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about dilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a mixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different colours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution. A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called pH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German, meaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a number which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher the hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value. The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale represent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it represents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is, increase in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated with the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.

Many changes during puberty, such as new hair-growth patterns, are signals that sexual maturation is taking place. On the other hand, the actual transfer of germ-cells between two people needs special organs for the sexual act, such as the penis when it is capable of becoming erect. In mammals such as humans, the baby is carried in the mother’s body for a long period, and will be breast-fed later. The female reproductive organs and breasts will need to mature to accommodate these possibilities. Let us look at the systems involved in the process of sexual reproduction.
 8.3.3 (a) Male Reproductive System The male reproductive system (Fig. 8.10) consists of portions which produce the germ-cells and other portions that deliver the germ-cells to the site of fertilisation. The formation of germ-cells or sperms takes place in the testes. These are located outside the abdominal cavity in scrotum because sperm formation requires a lower temperature than the normal body temperature. We have discussed the role of the testes in the secretion of the hormone, testosterone, in the previous chapter. In addition to regulating the formation of sperms, testosterone brings about changes in appearance seen in boys at the time of puberty. The sperms formed are delivered through the vas deferens which unites with a tube coming from the urinary bladder. The urethra thus forms a common passage for both the sperms and urine. Along the path of the vas deferens, glands like the prostate and the seminal vesicles add their secretions so that the sperms are now in a fluid which makes their transport easier and this fluid also provides nutrition. The sperms are tiny bodies that consist of mainly genetic material and a long tail that helps them to move towards the female germ-cell.

Along the path of the vas deferens, glands like the prostate and the seminal vesicles add their secretions so that the sperms are now in a fluid which makes their transport easier and this fluid also provides nutrition. The sperms are tiny bodies that consist of mainly genetic material and a long tail that helps them to move towards the female germ-cell.
 8.3.3 (a) Male Reproductive System The male reproductive system (Fig. 8.10) consists of portions which produce the germ-cells and other portions that deliver the germ-cells to the site of fertilisation. The formation of germ-cells or sperms takes place in the testes. These are located outside the abdominal cavity in scrotum because sperm formation requires a lower temperature than the normal body temperature. We have discussed the role of the testes in the secretion of the hormone, testosterone, in the previous chapter.

Hence, it breaks down and gets released in the form of blood and mucous through the vagina. This process lasts for 2–8 days. This cycle occurs every month and is known as menstruation.","When a girl is born, the ovaries already contain thousands of immature eggs. On reaching puberty, some of these start maturing. One egg is produced every month by one of the ovaries. The egg is carried from the ovary to the womb through a thin oviduct or fallopian tube. The two oviducts unite into an elastic bag-like structure known as the uterus. The uterus opens into the vagina through the cervix. The sperms enter through the vaginal passage during sexual intercourse. They travel upwards and reach the oviduct where they may encounter the egg. The fertilised egg (zygote) starts dividing and form a ball of cells or embryo. The embryo is implanted in the lining of the uterus where they continue to grow and develop organs to become foetus. We have seen in earlier sections that the mother’s body is designed to undertake the development of the child. Hence the uterus prepares itself every month to receive and nurture the growing embryo. The lining thickens and is richly supplied with blood to nourish the growing embryo. The embryo gets nutrition from the mother’s blood with the help of a special tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the uterine wall. It contains villi on the embryo’s side of the tissue. On the mother’s side are blood spaces, which surround the villi. This provides a large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to the embryo. The developing embryo will also generate waste substances which can be removed by transferring them into the mother’s blood through the placenta. The development of the child inside the mother’s body takes approximately nine months. The child is born as a result of rhythmic contractions of the muscles in the uterus.
 8.3.3 (c) What happens when the Egg is not Fertilised? If the egg is not fertilised, it lives for about one day. Since the ovary releases one egg every month, the uterus also prepares itself every month to receive a fertilised egg. Thus its lining becomes thick and spongy. This would be required for nourishing the embryo if fertilisation had taken place. Now, however, this lining is not needed any longer. So, the lining slowly breaks and comes out through the vagina as blood and mucous. This cycle takes place roughly every month and is known as menstruation. It usually lasts for about two to eight days.

(c) (i) Creating a mechanical barrier so that the sperms do not reach the egg. This is done with a condom which is worn around the penis or a similar device that is placed in the vagina. (ii) Changing the hormonal balance of the body so that fertilization cannot occur. This is done with the help of oral contraceptive pills. (iii) Contraceptive devices like loop or copper-T are placed in the uterus to prevent pregnancy. (iv) Surgical methods like vasectomy in males and tubectomy in females.","We must also consider the possible health consequences of having sex. We have discussed in Class IX that diseases can be transmitted from person to person in a variety of ways. Since the sexual act is a very intimate connection of bodies, it is not surprising that many diseases can be sexually transmitted. These include bacterial infections such as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as warts and HIV-AIDS. Is it possible to prevent the transmission of such diseases during the sexual act? Using a covering, called a condom, for the penis during sex helps to prevent transmission of many of these infections to some extent. The sexual act always has the potential to lead to pregnancy. Pregnancy will make major demands on the body and the mind of the woman, and if she is not ready for it, her health will be adversely affected. Therefore, many ways have been devised to avoid pregnancy. These contraceptive methods fall in a number of categories. One category is the creation of a mechanical barrier so that sperm does not reach the egg. Condoms on the penis or similar coverings worn in the vagina can serve this purpose. Another category of contraceptives acts by changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not released and fertilisation cannot occur. These drugs commonly need to be taken orally as pills. However, since they change hormonal balances, they can cause side-effects too. Other contraceptive devices such as the loop or the copper-T are placed in the uterus to prevent pregnancy. Again, they can cause side effects due to irritation of the uterus. If the vas deferens in the male is blocked, sperm transfer will be prevented. If the fallopian tube in the female is blocked, the egg will not be able to reach the uterus. In both cases fertilisation will not take place. Surgical methods can be used to create such blocks. While surgical methods are safe in the long run, surgery itself can cause infections and other problems if not performed properly. Surgery can also be used for removal of unwanted pregnancies. These may be misused by people who do not want a particular child, as happens in illegal sex-selective abortion of female foetuses. For a healthy society, the female-male sex ratio must be maintained. Because of reckless female foeticides, child sex ratio is declining at an alarming rate in some sections of our society, although prenatal sex determination has been prohibited by law. We have noted earlier that reproduction is the process by which organisms increase their populations. The rates of birth and death in a given population will determine its size. The size of the human population is a cause for concern for many people. This is because an expanding population makes it harder to improve everybody’s standard of living. However, if inequality in society is the main reason for poor standards of living for many people, the size of the population is relatively unimportant. If we look around us, what can we identify as the most important reason(s) for poor living standards? 139

(d) Two contraceptive methods : (i) Creating mechanical barrier. (ii) Using contraceptive pills. Two benefits of these methods are : (i) Protection from sexually transmitted diseases. (ii) Sufficient gap between successive births. ","8.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION We are also familiar with modes of reproduction that depend on the involvement of two individuals before a new generation can be created. Bulls alone cannot produce new calves, nor can hens alone produce new chicks. In such cases, both sexes, males and females, are needed to produce new generations. What is the significance of this sexual mode of reproduction? Are there any limitations of the asexual mode of reproduction, which we have been discussing above?
 8.3.1 Why the Sexual Mode of Reproduction? The creation of two new cells from one involves copying of the DNA as well as of the cellular apparatus. The DNA copying mechanism, as we have noted, cannot be absolutely accurate, and the resultant errors are a source of variations in populations of organisms. Every individual organism cannot be protected by variations, but in a population, variations are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. It would therefore make sense if organisms came up with reproductive modes that allowed more and more variation to be generated. While DNA-copying mechanisms are not absolutely accurate, they are precise enough to make the generation of variation a fairly slow process. If the DNA copying mechanisms were to be less accurate, many of the resultant DNA copies would not be able to work with the cellular apparatus, and would die. So how can the process of making variants be speeded up? Each new variation is made in a DNA copy that already has variations accumulated from previous generations. Thus, two different individuals in a population would have quite different patterns of accumulated variations. Since all of these variations are in living individuals, it is assured that they do not have any really bad effects. Combining variations from two or more individuals would thus create new combinations of variants. Each combination would be novel, since it would involve two different individuals. The sexual mode of
 Reproduction, unlike other life processes, is not essential to maintain the life of an individual organism. Reproduction involves creation of a DNA copy and additional cellular apparatus by the cell involved in the process. Various organisms use different modes of reproduction depending on their body design. In fission, many bacteria and protozoa simply divide into two or more daughter cells. Organisms such as hydra can regenerate if they are broken into pieces. They can also give out buds which mature into new individuals. Roots, stems and leaves of some plants develop into new plants through vegetative propagation. These are examples of asexual reproduction where new generations are created from a single individual. Sexual reproduction involves two individuals for the creation of a new individual. DNA copying mechanisms creates variations which are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. Modes of sexual reproduction allow for greater variation to be generated. Reproduction in flowering plants involves transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma which is referred to as pollination. This is followed by fertilisation. Changes in the body at puberty, such as increase in breast size in girls and new facial hair growth in boys, are signs of sexual maturation. The male reproductive system in human beings consists of testes which produce sperms, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, urethra and penis. The female reproductive system in human beings consists of ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus and vagina. Sexual reproduction in human beings involves the introduction of sperm in the vagina of the female. Fertilisation occurs in the fallopian tube. Contraception to avoid pregnancy can be achieved by the use of condoms, oral pills, copper-T and other methods.

Catalysts are substances that cause a reaction to occur or proceed at a different rate without the reaction itself being affected. This reaction is commonly used in the hydrogenation of vegetable oils using a nickel catalyst. Vegetable oils generally have long unsaturated carbon chains while animal fats have saturated carbon chains.
 You must have seen advertisements stating that some vegetable oils are ‘healthy’. Animal fats generally contain saturated fatty acids which are said to be harmful for health. Oils containing unsaturated fatty acids should be chosen for cooking.
 4.3.4 Substitution Reaction Saturated hydrocarbons are fairly unreactive and are inert in the presence of most reagents. However, in the presence of sunlight, chlorine is added to hydrocarbons in a very fast reaction. Chlorine can replace the hydrogen atoms one by one. It is called a substitution reaction because one type of atom or a group of atoms takes the place of another. A number of products are usually formed with the higher homologues of alkanes. CH4 + Cl2 → CH3Cl + HCl (in the presence of sunlight)

Explain why carbon forms compounds mainly by covalent bonds. Explain in brief two main reasons for carbon forming a large number of compounds. Why does carbon form strong bonds with most other elements ?  What are the two properties of carbon which lead to the huge number of carbon compounds we see around us ?,"(i) Carbon has 4 electrons in its outermost shell, and needs to gain or lose 4 electrons to attain noble gas configuration. (ii) Losing or gaining 4 electrons is not possible due to energy considerations; hence it shares electrons to form covalent bonds. Two reasons for large number of carbon compounds : (i) Catenation : The unique ability of carbon to form bonds with other atoms of carbon, giving rise to long chains of different types of compounds. (ii) Tetravalency : Since carbon has a valency of 4, it is capable of bonding with four other atoms of carbon or atoms of elements like oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, chlorine, etc. The reason for the formation of strong bonds by carbon is its small size which enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons strongly. 1  Detailed Answer : Since carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of bonding with four other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other monovalent elements. In order to satisfy its tetravalency carbon can form double or triple bonds also with other C-atoms or with oxygen, nitrogen etc. Reasons for carbon forming a large number of compounds are : (i) Catenation : Carbon has the unique property or ability to form bonds with other atoms of carbon, giving rise to large molecules. This property is called catenation. These compounds may have long chains of carbon, branched chains of carbon or even carbon atoms arranged in rings. (ii) Tetravalency : Carbon has four valence electrons in its valence shell so the valency of carbon is four. Due to this valency, carbon is a tetravalent element and it has the capability of satisfying its tetravalent by sharing its electrons with some monovalent elements and forming covalent bonds. (iii) Carbon exhibits catenation much more than any other element due to its smaller size which makes the C — C bonds strong while the bonds between any other element are comparatively weaker due to its large size.","Since carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of bonding with four other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent element. Compounds of carbon are formed with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and many other elements giving rise to compounds with specific properties which depend on the elements other than carbon present in the molecule. Again the bonds that carbon forms with most other elements are very strong making these compounds exceptionally stable. One reason for the formation of strong bonds by carbon is its small size. This enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons strongly. The bonds formed by elements having bigger atoms are much weaker.

Elements forming ionic compounds attain noble gas electronic configuration by either gaining or losing electrons from their valence shells.

(i) Ionic/Electrovalent Bonds. (ii) Covalent bonds. (iii) There are no charged particles in carbon compounds and hence poor conductors of electricity. ,"saw how the nature of bonding in ionic compounds explains these properties. Let us now study the properties of some carbon compounds. Most carbon compounds are poor conductors of electricity as we have seen in Chapter 2. From the data given in Table 4.1 on the boiling and Table 4.1 Melting points and boiling points of some melting points of the carbon compounds, compounds of carbon we find that these compounds have low Compound Melting Boiling melting and boiling points as compared point (K) point (K) to ionic compounds (Chapter 3). We can Acetic acid (CH3COOH) 290 391 conclude that the forces of attraction between the molecules are not very Chloroform (CHCl3) 209 334 strong. Since these compounds are 351 Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) 156 largely non-conductors of electricity, we can conclude that the bonding in these Methane (CH4) 90 111 compounds does not give rise to any ions. In Class IX, we learnt about the combining capacity of various elements and how it depends on the number of valence electrons. Let us now look at the electronic configuration of carbon. The atomic number of carbon is 6. What would be the distribution of electrons in various shells of carbon? How many valence electrons will carbon have? We know that the reactivity of elements is explained as their tendency to attain a completely filled outer shell, that is, attain noble gas configuration. Elements forming ionic compounds achieve this by either gaining or losing electrons from the outermost shell. In the case of carbon, it has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four electrons to attain noble gas configuration. If it were to gain or lose electrons – (i) It could gain four electrons forming C4– anion. But it would be difficult for the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is, four extra electrons. (ii) It could lose four electrons forming C4+ cation. But it would require a large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a carbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two electrons. Carbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with other atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements. Not just carbon, but many other elements form molecules by sharing electrons in this manner. The shared electrons ‘belong’ to the outermost shells of both the atoms and lead to both atoms attaining the noble gas configuration. Before going on to compounds of carbon, let us look at some simple molecules formed by the sharing of valence electrons. The simplest molecule formed in this manner is that of hydrogen. As you have learnt earlier, the atomic number of hydrogen is 1. Hence hydrogen has one electron in its K shell and it requires one more electron to fill the K shell. So two hydrogen atoms share their electrons to form a molecule of hydrogen, H2. This allows each hydrogen atom to attain the

Greater C–C bond strength Carbon compounds are formed by covalent bonds. (i) Carbon compounds have low melting and boiling point because these compounds are bonded with covalent bond and also forces of attraction between these molecules are not very strong.

State the reason why carbon can neither form C4+ cations nor C4– anions but forms covalent compound. Also state the reason to explain why covalent compounds: (i) are bad conductors of electricity. (ii) have low melting and boiling points. ,"Atomic number of carbon is six. This means that it has four electrons in its outermost shell and it needs four more electrons to attain noble gas electronic configuration. It does not form C4+ cation, as the removal of four valence electrons will require a huge amount of energy. The cation formed will have six protons and two electrons. This makes it highly unstable. Carbon is unable to form C4– anion as its nucleus with six protons will not be able to hold ten electrons. Thus, carbon achieves noble gas electronic configuration by sharing its four electrons with other elements, i.e. it forms covalent compounds. (i) Covalent compounds are bad conductors of electricity due to lack of free electrons. (ii) Covalent compounds are formed by covalent bonds and it has been found that the intermolecular forces of attraction in covalent compounds are weak.

We have also seen the structure of a simple carbon compound, methane. In the beginning of the Chapter, we saw how many things we use contain carbon. In fact, we ourselves are made up of carbon compounds. The numbers of carbon compounds whose formulae are known to chemists was recently estimated to be in millions! This outnumbers by a large margin the compounds formed by all the other elements put together. Why is it that this property is seen in carbon and no other element?

How do the lenses used in spectacles correct defects of vision? Let us consider these questions in this chapter. We have learnt in the previous chapter about light and some of its properties. In this chapter, we shall use these ideas to study some of the optical phenomena in nature. We shall also discuss about rainbow formation, splitting of white light and blue colour of the sky.
 11.1 THE HUMAN EYE The human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs. It enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On closing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell, taste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however, impossible to identify colours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human eye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful, colourful world around us. The human eye is like a camera. Its lens system forms an image on a light-sensitive screen called the retina. Light enters the eye through a thin membrane called the cornea. It forms the transparent bulge on the front surface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 11.1. The eyeball is approximately spherical in shape with a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the refraction for the light rays entering the eye occurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The crystalline lens merely provides the finer adjustment of focal length required to focus objects at different distances on the retina. We find a structure called iris Figure 11.1 The human eye behind the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the size of the pupil.

","ou have studied in the previous chapter about refraction of light by lenses. You also studied the nature, position and relative size of images formed by lenses. How can these ideas help us in the study of the human eye? The human eye uses light and enables us to see objects around us. It has a lens in its structure. What is the function of the lens in a human eye? How do the lenses used in spectacles correct defects of vision? Let us consider these questions in this chapter. We have learnt in the previous chapter about light and some of its properties. In this chapter, we shall use these ideas to study some of the optical phenomena in nature. We shall also discuss about rainbow formation, splitting of white light and blue colour of the sky.
 11.1 THE HUMAN EYE The human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs. It enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On closing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell, taste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however, impossible to identify colours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human eye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful, colourful world around us. The human eye is like a camera. Its lens system forms an image on a light-sensitive screen called the retina. Light enters the eye through a thin membrane called the cornea. It forms the transparent bulge on the front surface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 11.1. The eyeball is approximately spherical in shape with a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the refraction for the light rays entering the eye occurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The crystalline lens merely provides the finer adjustment of focal length required to focus objects at different distances on the retina. We find a structure called iris Figure 11.1 The human eye behind the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the size of the pupil. The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light
 You talk of wondrous things you see, You say the sun shines bright; I feel him warm, but how can he Or make it day or night? – C. CIBBER Do you know that our eyes can live even after our death? By donating our eyes after we die, we can light the life of a blind person. About 35 million people in the developing world are blind and most of them can be cured. About 4.5 million people with corneal blindness can be cured through corneal transplantation of donated eyes. Out of these 4.5 million, 60% are children below the age of 12. So, if we have got the gift of vision, why not pass it on to somebody who does not have it? What do we have to keep in mind when eyes have to be donated? n Eye donors can belong to any age group or sex. People who use spectacles, or those operated for cataract, can still donate the eyes. People who are diabetic, have hypertension, asthma patients and those without communicable diseases can also donate eyes. n Eyes must be removed within 4-6 hours after death. Inform the nearest eye bank immediately. n The eye bank team will remove the eyes at the home of the deceased or at a hospital. n Eye removal takes only 10-15 minutes. It is a simple process and does not lead to any disfigurement. n Persons who were infected with or died because of AIDS, Hepatitis B or C, rabies, acute leukaemia, tetanus, cholera, meningitis or encephalitis cannot donate eyes. An eye bank collects, evaluates and distributes the donated eyes. All eyes donated are evaluated using strict medical standards. Those donated eyes found unsuitable for transplantation are used for valuable research and medical education. The identities of both the donor and the recipient remain confidential. One pair of eyes gives vision to up to FOUR CORNEAL BLIND PEOPLE.

A person with hypermetropia can see distant objects clearly but cannot see nearby objects distinctly. The near point, for the person, is farther away from the normal near point (25 cm). Such a person has to keep a reading material much beyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable reading. This is because the light rays from a closeby object are focussed at a point behind the retina as shown in Fig. 11.3 (b). This defect arises either because (i) the focal length of the eye lens is too long, or (ii) the eyeball has become too small. This defect can be corrected by using a convex lens of appropriate power. This is illustrated in Fig. 11.3 (c). Eye-glasses with converging lenses provide the additional focussing power required for forming the image on the retina.

The upper portion consists of a concave lens. It facilitates distant vision. The lower part is a convex lens. It facilitates near vision. These days, it is possible to correct the refractive defects with contact lenses or through surgical interventions.

"A non-biodegradable toxic chemical has entered into the food chain. Which type of food habit will you suggest to a man, vegetarian or non-vegetarian. Explain with the help of a food chain. The food chain which you would suggest, is advantageous in an another aspect. How ?","Vegetarian food chain will be suggested in case of entry of non-biodegradable toxic chemical into the () food chain. Non-biodegradable chemical gets concentrated at every trophic level by the process of biological concentration. As the concentration increases with the number of trophic level in a food chain, man will get high concentration of the chemical in non– vegetarian food chain than in a vegetarian food chain. Example : Vegetarian food chain : 		Plants → Man 		5 PPM 240 PPM 		of DDT of DDT Non-vegetarian food chain : 			Plants → Goat → Man 		5 PPM 240 PPM 1600 PPM 		of DDT		 of DDT of DDT 		Vegetarian food chain is advantageous in terms of energy available to man because it has less number of trophic level. As 90% of energy is lost to the environment, at every level lesser number of trophic level will result in lesser energy loss. 3 +2","In Activity 15.4 we have formed a series of organisms feeding on one another. This series or organisms taking part at various biotic levels form a food chain (Fig. 15.1). Each step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level. The autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level. They fix up the solar energy and make it available for heterotrophs or the consumers. The herbivores or the primary consumers come at the second, small carnivores or the secondary consumers at the third and larger carnivores or the tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level (Fig. 15.2). We know that the food we eat acts as a fuel to provide us energy to do work. Thus the interactions among various components of the environment involves flow of energy from one component of the system to another. As we have studied, the autotrophs capture the energy present in sunlight and convert it into chemical energy. This energy supports all the activities of the living world. From autotrophs, the energy goes to the heterotrophs and decomposers. However, as we saw in the previous Chapter on ‘Sources of Energy’, when one form of energy is changed to another, some energy is lost to the environment in forms which cannot be used again. The flow of energy between various components of the environment has been extensively studied and it has been found that – The green plants in a terrestrial ecosystem capture about 1% of the energy of sunlight that falls on their leaves and convert it into food energy. When green plants are eaten by primary consumers, a great deal of energy is lost as heat to the environment, some amount goes into digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth and reproduction. An average of 10% of the food eaten is turned into its own body and made available for the next level of consumers. Therefore, 10% can be taken as the average value for the amount of organic matter that is present at each step and reaches the next level of consumers. Since so little energy is available for the next level of consumers, food chains generally consist of only three or four steps. The loss of energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy remains after four trophic levels. There are generally a greater number of individuals at the lower trophic levels of an ecosystem, the greatest number is of the producers. The length and complexity of food chains vary greatly. Each organism is generally eaten by two or more other kinds of organisms which in turn are eaten by several other organisms. So instead of a straight line food chain, the relationship can be shown as a series of branching lines called a food web (Fig. 15.3).

(i) A coil of insulated copper wire is connected to a galvanometer. What happens if a bar magnet is : (a) pushed into the coil ? (b) withdrawn from inside the coil ? (c) held stationary inside the coil ? Give reasons for your observation. (ii) Mention one more method of inducing current in a coil. ,"(i) (a) When a bar magnet is pushed into the coil of insulated copper wire connected to a galvanometer, an induced current is set-up in the coil due to charge of magnetic field through it.

This indicates the presence of a current in the coil AB. The deflection becomes zero the moment the motion of the magnet stops. Now withdraw the north pole of the magnet away from the coil. Now the galvanometer is deflected toward the left, showing that the current is now set up in the direction opposite to the first. Place the magnet stationary at a point near to the coil, keeping its north pole towards the end B of the coil. We see that the galvanometer needle deflects toward the right when the coil is moved towards the north pole of the magnet. Similarly the needle moves toward left when the coil is moved away. When the coil is kept stationary with respect to the magnet, the deflection of the galvanometer drops to zero. What do you conclude from this activity?

 A galvanometer is an instrument that can detect the presence of a current in a circuit. The pointer remains at zero (the centre of the scale) for zero current flowing through it. It can deflect either to the left or to the right of the zero mark depending on the direction of current. You can also check that if you had moved south pole of the magnet towards the end B of the coil, the deflections in the galvanometer would just be opposite to the previous case. When the coil and the magnet are both stationary, there is no deflection in the galvanometer. It is, thus, clear from this activity that motion of a magnet with respect to the coil produces an induced potential difference, which sets up an induced electric current in the circuit.

 In this activity we observe that as soon as the current in coil-1 reaches either a steady value or zero, the galvanometer in coil-2 shows no deflection. From these observations, we conclude that a potential difference is induced in the coil-2 whenever the electric current through the coil–1 is changing (starting or stopping). Coil-1 is called the primary coil and coil-2 is called the secondary coil. As the current in the first coil changes, the magnetic field associated with it also changes. Thus the magnetic field lines around the secondary coil also change. Hence the change in magnetic field lines associated with the secondary coil is the cause of induced electric current in it. This process, by which a changing magnetic field in a conductor induces a current in another conductor, is called electromagnetic induction. In practice we can induce current in a coil either by moving it in a magnetic field or by changing the magnetic field around it. It is convenient in most situations to move the coil in a magnetic field. The induced current is found to be the highest when the direction of motion of the coil is at right angles to the magnetic field. In this situation, we can use a simple rule to know the direction of the induced current. Stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of right hand so that they are perpendicular to each other, as shown in Fig. 13.18. If the forefinger indicates the direction of the magnetic field and the thumb shows the direction of motion of conductor, then the middle finger will show the direction Figure 13.18 of induced current. This simple rule is called Fleming’s Fleming’s right-hand rule right-hand rule.

The direction of north pole of the compass would give the direction of magnetic field lines. Maxwell’s Right Hand Thumb Rule is used to find the direction of magnetic field lines. It states that ‘‘Imagine you are holding a current carrying conductor in your right hand such that the thumb points in the direction of current. Then your fingers will wrap around the conductor in the direction of the magnetic field lines.’’ Refer Fig. Q. 1. of L.A.T.Q. ","Connect the copper wire vertically between the points X and Y, as shown in Fig. 13.6 (a), in series with the battery, a plug and key. Sprinkle some iron filings uniformly on the cardboard. (You may use a salt sprinkler for this purpose.) Keep the variable of the rheostat at a fixed position and note the current through the ammeter. Close the key so that a current flows through the wire. Ensure that the copper wire placed between the points X and Y remains vertically straight. Gently tap the cardboard a few times. Observe the pattern of the iron filings. You would find that the iron filings align themselves showing a pattern of concentric circles around the copper wire (Fig. 13.6). What do these concentric circles represent? They represent the magnetic field lines. How can the direction of the magnetic field be found? Place a compass at a point (say P) over a circle. Observe the direction of the needle. The direction of the north pole of the compass needle would give the direction of the field lines produced by the electric current through the straight wire at point P. Show the direction by an arrow. Does the direction of magnetic field lines get reversed if the direction of current through the straight copper wire is reversed? Check it.
 Imagine that you are holding a current-carrying straight conductor in your right hand such that the thumb points towards the direction of current. Then your fingers will wrap around the conductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 13.7. This is known as the right-hand thumb rule*. Example 13.1 A current through a horizontal power line flows in east to west direction. What is the direction of magnetic field at a point directly below it and at a point directly above it?
 Figure 13.7 Right-hand thumb rule
 Solution The current is in the east-west direction. Applying the right-hand thumb rule, we get that the magnetic field (at any point below or above the wire) turns clockwise in a plane perpendicular to the wire, when viewed from the east end, and anti-clockwise, when viewed from the west end.

(i) A stationary charge is placed in a magnetic field. Will it experience a force ? Give reason to justify your answer. (ii) On what factors does the direction of force experienced by a conductor when placed in a magnetic field depend ? (iii) Under what conditions is the force experienced by a current carrying conductor placed in a uniform magnetic field maximum ? (iv) Name and state the rule which gives the direction of force experienced by a current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field. ,"(i) No, a magnetic field exerts a force only on moving charges. (ii) The direction of force depends on the direction of current and direction of magnetic field. (iii) The force is maximum when the direction of current is at right angles to the direction of magnetic field. (iv) Fleming’s Left Hand Rule. According to this rule—‘‘Stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of your left hand such that they are mutually perpendicular to each other. If the first finger points in the direction of magnetic field and the middle finger in the direction of current, then the thumb will point in the direction of motion or the force acting on the conductor.’’ ","the direction of force acting on the current-carrying rod gets reversed. It shows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the direction of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments have shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the magnitude of the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles to the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a simple rule to find the direction of the force on the conductor. In Activity 13.7, we considered the direction of the current and that of the magnetic field perpendicular to each other and found that the force is perpendicular to both of them. The three directions can be illustrated through a simple rule, called Fleming’s left-hand rule. According to this rule, stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of your left hand such that they are mutually perpendicular (Fig. 13.13). If the first finger points in the direction of magnetic field and the second finger in the direction of current, then the Figure 13.13 thumb will point in the direction of motion or Fleming’s left-hand rule the force acting on the conductor. Devices that use current-carrying conductors and magnetic fields include electric motor, electric generator, loudspeakers, microphones and measuring instruments. In the next few sections we shall study about electric motors and generators. Example 13.2 An electron enters a magnetic field at right angles to it, as shown in Fig. 13.14. The direction of force acting on the electron will be (a) to the right. (b) to the left. (c) out of the page. (d) into the page.
 Figure 13.14
 Solution Answer is option (d). The direction of force is perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field and current as given by Fleming’s left hand rule. Recall that the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction of motion of electrons. The force is therefore directed into the page.

 As we can see, the metals like Na and Mg are towards the left-hand side of the Periodic Table while the non-metals like sulphur and chlorine are found on the right-hand side. In the middle, we have silicon, which is classified as a semi-metal or metalloid because it exhibits some properties of both metals and non-metals. In the Modern Periodic Table, a zig-zag line separates metals from non-metals. The borderline elements – boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, tellurium and polonium – are intermediate in properties and are called metalloids or semi-metals.

 You will find that these elements of second period do not have the same number of valence electrons, but they contain the same number of shells.

We can explain the number of elements in these periods based on how electrons are filled into various shells. You will study the details of this in higher classes. Recall that the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in a shell depends on the formula 2n2 where ‘n’ is the number of the given shell from the nucleus. For example, K Shell – 2 × (1)2 = 2, hence the first period has 2 elements. L Shell – 2 × (2)2 = 8, hence the second period has 8 elements. The third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh periods have 8, 18, 18, 32 and 32 elements respectively. The reason for this you will study in higher classes. The position of an element in the Periodic Table tells us about its chemical reactivity. As you have learnt, the valence electrons determine the kind and number of bonds formed by an element. Can you now say why Mendeléev’s choice of formulae of compounds as the basis for deciding the position of an element in his Table was a good one? How would this lead to elements with similar chemical properties being placed in the same group?

What is a balanced chemical equation ? Why should chemical equation be balanced ? ,"The equation in which atoms of various elements on both sides of a chemical equation are equal in accordance with the law of conservation of mass is known as balanced chemical equation. The chemical equation is to be balanced in accordance to the law of conservation of mass. It means the total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction has to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants. In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the same, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a chemical equation.","Count and compare the number of atoms of each element on the LHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the same on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not, then the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on both sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal chemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical equation for the burning of magnesium in air.
 1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations Recall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction has to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants. In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the same, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a skeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us learn about balancing a chemical equation step by step. The word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as – Zinc + Sulphuric acid → Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen The above word-equation may be represented by the following chemical equation – Zn + H2SO4 → ZnSO4 + H2

Step VII: Writing Symbols of Physical States Carefully examine the above balanced Eq. (1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about the physical state of each reactant and product? No information has been given in this equation about their physical states. To make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states of the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical formulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants and products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s), respectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product is present as a solution in water. The balanced Eq. (1.9) becomes 3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)

This point is called the centre of curvature of the spherical mirror. It is represented by the letter C. Please note that the centre of curvature is not a part of the mirror.

Is there a relationship between the radius of curvature R, and focal length f, of a spherical mirror? For spherical mirrors of small apertures, the radius of curvature is found to be equal to twice the focal length. We put this as R = 2f .

()","12.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE What makes the electric charge to flow? Let us consider the analogy of flow of water. Charges do not flow in a copper wire by themselves, just as water in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube is connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of the other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic wire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only if there is a difference of electric pressure – called the potential difference – along the conductor. This difference of potential may be produced by a battery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within a cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell, even when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a conducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in motion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to maintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its chemical energy stored in it. We define the electric potential difference between two points in an electric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit charge from one point to the other – Potential difference (V) between two points = Work done (W )/Charge (Q) V = W/Q (12.2) The SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after Alessandro Volta (1745 –1827), an Italian physicist.

How could the white light of the Sun give us various colours of the rainbow? Before we take up this question, we shall first go back to the refraction of light through a prism.

 Take a thick sheet of cardboard and make a small hole or narrow slit in its middle. Allow sunlight to fall on the narrow slit. This gives a narrow beam of white light. Now, take a glass prism and allow the light from the slit to fall on one of its faces as shown in Fig. 11.5. Turn the prism slowly until the light that comes out of it appears on a nearby screen.

 The prism has probably split the incident white light into a band of colours. Note the colours that appear at the two ends of the colour band. What is the sequence of colours that you see on the screen? The various colours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange and Red, as shown in Fig. 11.5. The acronym VIBGYOR will help you to remember the sequence of colours. The band of the coloured components of a light beam is called its spectrum. You might Figure 11.5 Dispersion of white light by the glass prism not be able to see all the colours separately. Yet something makes each colour distinct from the other. The splitting of light into its component colours is called dispersion. You have seen that white light is dispersed into its seven-colour components by a prism. Why do we get these colours? Different colours of light bend through different angles with respect to the incident ray, as they pass through a prism. The red light bends the least while the violet the most. Thus the rays of each colour emerge along different paths and thus become distinct. It is the band of distinct colours that we see in a spectrum. Isaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain the spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of the spectrum of white light further by using another similar prism. However, he could not get any more colours. He then placed a second identical prism in an inverted position with respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 11.6.

The splitting of light into its component colours is called dispersion. You have seen that white light is dispersed into its seven-colour components by a prism. Why do we get these colours? Different colours of light bend through different angles with respect to the incident ray, as they pass through a prism. The red light bends the least while the violet the most. Thus the rays of each colour emerge along different paths and thus become distinct. It is the band of distinct colours that we see in a spectrum. Isaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain the spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of the spectrum of white light further by using another similar prism. However, he could not get any more colours. He then placed a second identical prism in an inverted position with respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 11.6.

In the previous class, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles. The path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible. However, its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where the size of the particles is relatively larger.

(a) A student suffering from myopia is not able to see distinctly the objects placed beyond 5 m. List two (b),"possible reasons due to which this defect of vision may have arisen. With the help of ray diagrams, explain (i) why the student is unable to see distinctly the objects placed beyond 5 m from his eyes. (ii) the type of corrective lens used to restore proper vision and how hi defect is corrected by the use of this lens. If, in this case, the numerical value of the focal length of the corrective lens is 5 m, find the power of lens as per the new Cartesian sign convention.   Detailed Answer : (a) (i) The student is unable to see distinctly the objects placed beyond 5 m from his eyes as he is suffering from myopia i.e., near-sightedness wherein a person can see near by objects clearly but cannot see distant objects distinctly. (ii) Concave lens can be used as the corrective lens to restore proper vision. A concave lens of suitable power will bring the image back on to the retina and thus the defect is corrected.

In such conditions, the person cannot see the objects distinctly and comfortably. The vision becomes blurred due to the refractive defects of the eye. There are mainly three common refractive defects of vision. These are (i) myopia or near -sightedness, (ii) Hypermetropia or far sightedness, and (iii) Presbyopia. These defects can be corrected by the use of suitable spherical lenses. We discuss below these defects and their correction. (a) Myopia Myopia is also known as near-sightedness. A person with myopia can see nearby objects clearly but cannot see distant objects distinctly. A person with this defect has the far point nearer than infinity. Such a person may see clearly upto a distance of a few metres. In a myopic eye, the image of a distant object is formed in front of the retina [Fig. 11.2 (b)] and not at the retina itself. This defect may arise due to (i) excessive curvature of the eye lens, or (ii) elongation of the eyeball. This defect can be corrected by using a concave lens of suitable power. This is illustrated in Fig. 11.2 (c). A concave lens of suitable power will bring the image back on to Figure 11.2 the retina and thus the defect (a), (b) The myopic eye, and (c) correction for myopia with a is corrected. concave lens 189

What is atmospheric refraction ? Use this phenomenon to explain the following natural events.  (i) Twinkling of stars. (ii) Advanced sun-rise and delayed sun-set. Draw diagrams to illustrate your answers.,"Atmospheric refraction : Refraction of light caused by the earth’s atmosphere due to change in the refractive indices of different layers. Apparent (i) Twinkling of stars : Stars are distant point sized source of light. The path of the rays of light coming from the star goes on varying due to atmospheric refraction slightly. Thus apparent position of the stars fluctuates and the amount of star light entering the eye flickers giving the twinkling effect. (ii) Advanced sun-rise : When the sun is slightly below the horizon, light rays coming from the sun travel from the rarer to denser layers of air. Because of atmospheric refraction of light, light appears to come from a higher position above the horizon. Thus sun appears earlier than actual sunrise. Delayed sunset : Same reason as similar refraction occurs at the sunset.

 You might have observed the apparent random wavering or flickering of objects seen through a turbulent stream of hot air rising above a fire or a radiator. The air just above the fire becomes hotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense) than the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly less than that of the cooler air. Since the physical conditions of the refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent position of the object, as seen through the hot air, fluctuates. This wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction of light by the earth’s atmosphere) on a small scale in our local environment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on a much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it. Twinkling of stars The twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The starlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction continuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction occurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the atmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position of the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears slightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the horizon (Fig. 11.9). Further, this apparent position of the star is not stationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions of the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the previous paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate point-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from the star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star fluctuates and the amount of

(a) Describe an activity along with a labelled diagram the phenomenon of dispersion through a prism.

(i) Fix two pins T and S on one side. (ii) Place the prism on the boundary ABC. (iii) Looking through the other side fix two more pins Q and R in such a way that the all four pins appear to be in the same line. (iv) Remove the pins and mark their positions. (v) Join TS and RQ and extend them to meet the faces of the prism at P and O respectively. (vi) Join PO. (vii) TP represents the incident ray. (viii) PO represents the refracted ray. (ix) And OR represents the emergent ray which is bent towards the base. (x) Let PN and ON be the normal at the points P and O respectively. (xi) And let i be the angle of incidence and r the angle of refraction. (xii) If the incident ray TP is extended forward and the emergent ray RO backwards, they meet at M, forming the angle OML. (xiii) Measure the angle OML. (xiv) This angle is called the angle of deviation. (xv) Angle of deviation is the angle through which an incident ray deviates. (xvi) Repeat this for different values of angle of incidence. i r N' M' F ∠ i – Angle of incidence ∠ r – Angle of refraction ∠ e – Angle of emergence ∠ D – Angle of deviation (b) Rainbow forms when sunlight hits the water droplets suspended in the atmosphere and undergoes total internal reflection. When the sunlight comes out of the drop it disperses, where the drop acts like a small prism. This dispersion or breaking up of light into several colours forms the Rainbow. PE – Incident ray EF – Refracted ray FS – Emergent ray ∠A – Angle of the prism Raindrop Sunlight Red Violet  2","Here PE is the incident ray, EF is the refracted ray and FS is the emergent ray. You may note that a ray of light is entering from air to glass at the first surface AB. The light ray on refraction has bent towards the normal. At the second surface AC, the light ray has entered from glass to air. Hence it has bent away from normal. Compare the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction at each refracting surface of the prism. Is this similar to the kind of bending that occurs in a glass slab? The peculiar shape of the prism makes the emergent ray bend at an angle to the direction of the incident ray. This angle is called the angle of deviation. In this case ∠D is the angle of deviation. Mark the angle of deviation in the above activity and measure it.

 allowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through the second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging from the other side of the second prism. This observation gave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven colours. Any light that gives a spectrum similar to that of sunlight is often referred to as white light. A rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky after a rain shower (Fig. 11.7). It is caused by dispersion of sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the atmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a direction opposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets act like small prisms. They refract and disperse the incident sunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it again when it comes out of the raindrop (Fig. 11.8). Due to the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different colours reach the observer’s eye. You can also see a rainbow on a sunny day when you look at the sky through a waterfall or through a water fountain, with the Sun behind you.

(i) A person’s image when seen through a stream of hot air arising above a fire disperse to waver. Explain. (ii) Define dispersion. How does a prism disperse white light ?  (iii) Which colour of light bends the most and the least?,"(i) In the region above the fire, the hot air is lighter than the cool air above it. Further the refractive index of hotter region is less than the cooler region and it is not static. These physical conditions are not steady. Subsequently the image when seen through the hot region is not stationary. The apparent position of the object fluctuates. This gives the wavering effect to the image. (ii) The phenomenon of obtaining a spectrum of colours by passing white light through the prism is known as dispersion. Dispersion occurs because the refraction of different colours travel with different speeds in a refracting medium. Speed of violet colour is least and that of the red colour is the most. Hence the refractive index of the medium is largest for violet colour and least for the red colour. (iii) As a result, the refraction or bending of violet colour is the maximum and that of red colour is minimum. This difference in the extent of bending of different colour of light causes dispersion of white light into its constituent colours as they emerge out of prism. Red colour bends the least and violet bends the most.","11.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL ASS PRISM GLASS You must have seen and appreciated the spectacular colours in a rainbow.

For doing this, we need to know more about how our choices affect the environment, these effects may be immediate or longterm or long-ranging. The concept of sustainable development encourages forms of growth that meet current basic human needs, while preserving the resources for the needs of future generations. Economic development is linked to environmental conservation. Thus sustainable development implies a change in all aspects of life. It depends upon the willingness of the people to change their perceptions of the socio-economic and environmental conditions around them, and the readiness of each individual to alter their present use of natural resources.
 Our resources like forests, wildlife, water, coal and petroleum need to be used in a sustainable manner. We can reduce pressure on the environment by sincerely applying the maxim of ‘Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose and Recycle’ in our lives. Management of forest resources has to take into account the interests of various stakeholders. The harnessing of water resources by building dams has social, economic and environmental implications. Alternatives to large dams exist. These are localespecific and may be developed so as to give local people control over their local resources. The fossil fuels, coal and petroleum, will ultimately be exhausted. Because of this and because their combustion pollutes our environment, we need to use these resources judiciously.

In the ‘reuse’ strategy, you simply use things again and again. Instead of throwing away used envelopes, you can reverse it and use it again. The plastic bottles in which you buy various food-items like jam or pickle can be used for storing things in the kitchen. What other items can we reuse?
 Recycle:
 This means that you collect plastic, paper, glass and metal items and recycle these materials to make required things instead of synthesising or extracting fresh plastic, paper, glass or metal. In order to recycle, we first need to segregate our wastes so that the material that can be recycled is not dumped along with other wastes.

",(i) Nasal passage Trachea Mouth cavity Pharynx Larynx Rings of cartilage Lung Bronchi Bronchioles Alveolar sac Ribs Diaphragm (ii) So that there is sufficient time for oxygen to be absorbed and for CO2 to be released. ,"Figure 6.9 Human respiratory system
 Do You Know? Smoking is injurious to health. Lung cancer is one of common causes of deaths in the world. The upper part of respiratory tract is provided with small hair -like structures called cilia. These cilia help to remove germs, dust and other harmful particles from inhaled air. Smoking destroys these hair due to which germs, dust, smoke and other harmful chemicals enter lungs and cause infection, cough and even lung cancer.
 Within the lungs, the passage divides into smaller and smaller tubes which finally terminate in balloon-like structures which are called alveoli (singular–alveolus). The alveoli provide a surface where the exchange of gases can take place. The walls of the alveoli contain an extensive network of blood-vessels. As we have seen in earlier years, when we breathe in, we lift our ribs and flatten our diaphragm, and the chest cavity becomes larger as a result. Because of this, air is sucked into the lungs and fills the expanded alveoli. The blood brings carbon dioxide from the rest of the body for release into the alveoli, and the oxygen in the alveolar air is taken up by blood in the alveolar blood vessels to be transported to all the cells in the body. During the breathing cycle, when air is taken in and let out, the lungs always contain a residual volume of air so that there is sufficient time for oxygen to be absorbed and for the carbon dioxide to be released. When the body size of animals is large, the diffusion pressure alone cannot take care of oxygen delivery to all parts of the body. Instead, respiratory pigments take up oxygen from the air in the lungs and carry it to tissues which are deficient in oxygen before releasing it. In human beings, the respiratory pigment is haemoglobin which has a very high affinity for oxygen. This pigment is present in the red blood corpuscles. Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than oxygen is and hence is mostly transported in the dissolved form in our blood.

(ii) Conversion of light energy to chemical energy and splitting of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. (iii) Reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. These steps need not take place one after the other immediately. For example, desert plants take up carbon dioxide at night and prepare an intermediate which is acted upon by the energy absorbed by the chlorophyll during the day. Let us see how each of the components of the above reaction are necessary for photosynthesis. If you carefully observe a cross-section of a leaf under the microscope (shown in Fig. 6.1), you will notice that some cells contain green dots. These green dots are cell organelles called chloroplasts which contain chlorophyll. Let us do an activity which demonstrates that chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis.

What are plant hormones ? Give four different types of plant hormones and state their functions briefly.  ,"The chemical compounds released by stimulated cells for control and coordination in plants are called plant hormones or phytohormones. Auxin - controls growth Gibberellins - helps growth in stem Cytokinin - promotes cell division Abscisic acid - Inhibits growth, wilting of leaves 5 ","Electrical impulses are an excellent means for this. But there are limitations to the use of electrical impulses. Firstly, they will reach only those cells that are connected by nervous tissue, not each and every cell in the animal body. Secondly, once an electrical impulse is generated in a cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms before it can generate and transmit a new impulse. In other words, cells cannot continually create and transmit electrical impulses. It is thus no wonder that most multicellular organisms use another means of communication between cells, namely, chemical communication. If, instead of generating an electrical impulse, stimulated cells release a chemical compound, this compound would diffuse all around the original cell. If other cells around have the means to detect this compound using special molecules on their surfaces, then they would be able to recognise information, and even transmit it. This will be slower, of course, but it can potentially reach all cells of the body, regardless of nervous connections, and it can be done steadily and persistently. These compounds, or hormones used by multicellular organisms for control and coordination show a great deal of diversity, as we would expect. Different plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and responses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from where they act and simply diffuse to the area of action. Let us take an example that we have worked with earlier [Activity 7.2]. When growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised at the shoot tip, helps the cells to grow longer. When light is coming from one side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot. This concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the side of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to bend towards light. Another example of plant hormones are gibberellins which, like auxins, help in the growth of the stem. Cytokinins promote cell division, and it is natural then that they are present in greater concentration in areas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds. These are examples of plant hormones that help in promoting growth. But plants also need signals to stop growing. Abscisic acid is one example of a hormone which inhibits growth. Its effects include wilting of leaves.

(b) The ability of a plant to detect change and respond to that change is termed as the sensitivity of the plant. Yet plants have no nervous system and no muscle tissue, they use electrical and chemical () means to convey the information from one cell to another cell. The leaves of the sensitive plant (Mimosa Pudica) folds up in response to touch. These leaf movements are independent of growth whereas, the directional movement of the shoot of a germinating seedling breaking through the soil is growth dependent.","What are plant hormones?

It has been observed that young cotton seedlings have small root system, making it difficult for them to reach available soil water.

What is pollination ? How does it occur in plants ? How does pollination lead to fertilization ? Explain. ,"The transfer of pollens from anther to the stigma of a flower is called pollination. The transfer is accomplished by an external agency such as wind (anemophily), water (hydrophily), insects (entomophily), birds (ornithophily), bats (chiropterophily), etc. Both wind and water are abiotic agencies while insects, birds, bats etc. are biotic agencies of pollination. After falling on stigma, the pollen grain absorbs water and nutrients. It produces a tube called pollen tube. Pollen tube grows through style and reaches the ovary. Its tip contains a tube nucleus and two male gametes or sperm cells. The advancing pollen tube enters an ovule, generally through micropyle and reaches the interior of the embryo sac. Here the tube bursts to release its two male gametes. One male gamete fuses with egg to form zygote and the second male gamete fuses with binucleate central cells which forms endosperm.","8.3.2 Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants

We need to detect it, and respond to it. How do we detect that we are touching a hot object? All information from our environment is detected by the specialised tips of some nerve cells. These receptors are usually located in our sense organs, such as the inner ear, the nose, the tongue, and so (a) on. So gustatory receptors will detect taste while olfactory receptors will detect smell. This information, acquired at the end of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell [Fig. 7.1 (a)], sets off a chemical reaction that creates an electrical impulse. This impulse travels from the dendrite to the cell body, and then along the axon to its end. At the end of the axon, the electrical impulse sets off the release of some chemicals. These chemicals cross the (b) gap, or synapse, and start a similar electrical impulse in a dendrite of the next Figure 7.1 (a) Structure of neuron, (b) Neuromuscular junction neuron. This is a general scheme of how nervous impulses travel in the body. A similar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to other cells, such as muscles cells or gland [Fig. 7.1 (b)]. It is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised network of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting information via electrical impulses from one part of the body to another. Look at Fig. 7.1 (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where information is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an electrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a chemical signal for onward transmission.

Gibberellins : They help in growth of stem. Cytokinins : They promote cell division and delay leaf ageing. Abscisic acid : It prevents wilting of leaves.,"7.1.1 What happens in Reflex Actions? ‘Reflex’ is a word we use very commonly when we talk about some sudden action in response to something in the environment. We say ‘I jumped out of the way of the bus reflexly’, or ‘I pulled my hand back from the flame reflexly’, or ‘I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly’. What exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that we do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control of our reactions. Yet these are situations where we are responding with some action to changes in our environment. How is control and coordination achieved in such situations? Let us consider this further. Take one of our examples. Touching a flame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any animal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to think consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt, and therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long will it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think. If nerve impulses are sent around the way we have talked about earlier, then thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses. Thinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated interaction of many nerve impulses from many neurons. If this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our body consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits in the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the body which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in order to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull must be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body. Similarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves must carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is to be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to get burnt! How does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than having to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat were to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way, the process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by an output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is commonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 7.2). Where should such reflex arc connections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve? The best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet each other. Nerves from all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal cord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord itself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain. Of course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking process of the brain is not fast enough. In fact many animals have very little or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is quite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning in the absence of true thought processes. However, even after complex neuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be more efficient for quick responses.

 Can you now trace the sequence of events which occur when a bright light is focussed on your eyes?
 7.1.2 Human Brain Is reflex action the only function of the spinal cord? Obviously not, since we know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of nerves which supply information to think about. Thinking involves more complex mechanisms and neural connections. These are concentrated in the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body. The brain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system. They receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it. We also think about our actions. Writing, talking, moving a chair, clapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions which are based on deciding what to do next. So, the brain also has to send messages to muscles. This is the second way in which the nervous system communicates with the muscles. The communication between the central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated by the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising from the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain thus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking. As you will expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different parts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs. The brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain, mid-brain and hind-brain. The fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions which receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas of the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on. There are separate areas of association where this sensory information is interpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors as well as with information that is already stored in the brain.

(i) Define reflex action. State its significance. (ii) How do plants respond to external stimuli ? ,"(i) Reflex action : It is defined as an unconscious, automatic and involuntary response of effectors, i.e. muscles and glands, to a stimulus, which is monitored through the spinal cord. Significance : It protect us from any sudden stimulus which may harm us. (ii) Plants produce hormones and respond to external stimuli, by growing towards sources of water and light, which they need to survive. A tropism is a growth in response to a stimulus and an auxin is a plant hormone produced in the stem tips and roots, which controls the direction of growth.","7.2.1 Immediate Response to Stimulus Let us think about the first kind of movement, such as that of the sensitive plant. Since no growth is involved, the plant must actually move its leaves in response to touch. But there is no nervous tissue, nor any muscle tissue. How does the plant detect the touch, and how do the leaves move in response?

(i) Write names of hormones secreted by pituitary gland and adrenal gland. State their functions in the body. (ii) Explain feedback mechanism for regulation of hormonal secretion with the help of one example. ,"(i) Pituitary gland secretes growth hormone. It regulates growth and development of the body. Adrenal gland secretes adrenaline hormone. It creates stress in our body. (ii) The timing and amount of hormones released by various glands is controlled by feedback mechanism which is in built in our body, e.g, if sugar level in blood rises too high, it is detected by cells of pancreas which respond by producing and secreting more insulin into blood. As blood sugar falls to certain level, the secretion of insulin is reduced automatically.","Do You Know? Hypothalamus plays an important role in the release of many hormones. For example, when the level of growth hormone is low, the hypothalamus releases growth hormone releasing factor which stimulates the pituitary gland to release growth hormone.
 Let us examine some examples to understand how hormones help in coordinated growth. We have all seen salt packets which say ‘iodised salt’ or ‘enriched with iodine’. Why is it important for us to have iodised salt in our diet? Iodine is necessary for the thyroid gland to make thyroxin hormone. Thyroxin regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism in the body so as to provide the best balance for growth. Iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroxin. In case iodine is deficient in our diet, there is a possibility that we might suffer from goitre. One of the symptoms in this disease is a swollen neck. Can you correlate this with the position of the thyroid gland in Fig. 7.7? Sometimes we come across people who are either very short (dwarfs) or extremely tall (giants). Have you ever wondered how this happens? Growth hormone is one of the hormones secreted by the pituitary. As its name indicates, growth hormone regulates growth and development of the body. If there is a deficiency of this hormone in childhood, it leads to dwarfism. You must have noticed many dramatic changes in your appearance as well as that of your friends as you approached 10–12 years of age. These changes associated with puberty are because of the secretion of testosterone in males and oestrogen in females. Do you know anyone in your family or friends who has been advised by the doctor to take less sugar in their diet because they are suffering from diabetes? As a treatment, they might be taking injections of insulin. This is a hormone which is produced by the pancreas and helps in regulating blood sugar levels. If it is not secreted in proper amounts, the sugar level in the blood rises causing many harmful effects.
 If it is so important that hormones should be secreted in precise quantities, we need a mechanism through which this is done. The timing and amount of hormone released are regulated by feedback mechanisms. For example, if the sugar levels in blood rise, they are detected by the cells of the pancreas which respond by producing more insulin. As the blood sugar level falls, insulin secretion is reduced.

All these involuntary actions including blood pressure, salivation and vomiting are controlled by the medulla in the hind-brain.

Have you ever wondered how this happens? Growth hormone is one of the hormones secreted by the pituitary. As its name indicates, growth hormone regulates growth and development of the body. If there is a deficiency of this hormone in childhood, it leads to dwarfism. You must have noticed many dramatic changes in your appearance as well as that of your friends as you approached 10–12 years of age. These changes associated with puberty are because of the secretion of testosterone in males and oestrogen in females. Do you know anyone in your family or friends who has been advised by the doctor to take less sugar in their diet because they are suffering from diabetes? As a treatment, they might be taking injections of insulin. This is a hormone which is produced by the pancreas and helps in regulating blood sugar levels. If it is not secreted in proper amounts, the sugar level in the blood rises causing many harmful effects.
 Control and coordination are the functions of the nervous system and hormones in our bodies. The responses of the nervous system can be classified as reflex action, voluntary action or involuntary action. The nervous system uses electrical impulses to transmit messages. The nervous system gets information from our sense organs and acts through our muscles. Chemical coordination is seen in both plants and animals. Hormones produced in one part of an organism move to another part to achieve the desired effect. A feedback mechanism regulates the action of the hormones. 125

(a) Define hormone. Write any four characteristics of hormones in humans. (b) Name the disorder caused by following situations (i) Under secretion of growth hormone.  (ii) Over secretion of growth hormone. (iii) Under secretion of insulin. (iv) Deficiency of Iodine.,(a) Hormones are the chemical substances which co-ordinate and control the activities of living organisms and also their growth. Characteristics of hormones are : (i) They are chemical messengers (ii) Regulate behaviour of target cells. (iii) They stimulate the target organs. (iv) They are proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous in nature. (b) (i) Dwarfism 		(ii) Tallness 		(iii) Diabetes 		(iv) Goitre,"Let us examine some examples to understand how hormones help in coordinated growth. We have all seen salt packets which say ‘iodised salt’ or ‘enriched with iodine’. Why is it important for us to have iodised salt in our diet? Iodine is necessary for the thyroid gland to make thyroxin hormone. Thyroxin regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism in the body so as to provide the best balance for growth. Iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroxin. In case iodine is deficient in our diet, there is a possibility that we might suffer from goitre.

(a) Name two hormones secreted by pancreas. Write one function of each hormone. (b) How does our body respond when adrenaline is secreted into the blood ? (c) Cite an example to explain the feedback mechanism for regulation of hormonal secretion.,"(a) Insulin : Regulates sugar metabolism, maintain blood sugar level. Glucagon : Increases blood sugar level. (b) Blood takes adrenaline to its target sites : Our heart beats faster resulting in more supply of O2 and glucose to our muscle. In liver, glycogen changes into glucose. Breathing increases. This makes more O2 available. Blood supply to digestive system and skin is reduced and more blood is passed to skeletal muscles. (c) The timing and amount of hormone released are regulated by feedback mechanism. Example : When sugar level in blood rises more insulin is secreted. Insulin removes extra glucose from the blood by converting into glycogen. Falling glucose level reduces insulin secretion by pancreas. CONTROL AND CO-ORDINATION","If it is so important that hormones should be secreted in precise quantities, we need a mechanism through which this is done. The timing and amount of hormone released are regulated by feedback mechanisms. For example, if the sugar levels in blood rise, they are detected by the cells of the pancreas which respond by producing more insulin. As the blood sugar level falls, insulin secretion is reduced.

"What is vegetative propagation ? List with brief explanation three advantages of practising this process for growing same types of plants. Select two plants from the following which are grown by this process : Banana, Wheat, Mustard, Jasmine, Gram. ","(a) Vegetative propagation is the development of a new plant from the vegetative parts / roots, stem and leaves of a plant. (b) Advantages : (i) Such plants can bear flowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds (ii) Allows propagation of plants (banana, orange etc) that have lost capacity to produce seeds. (iii) All plants produced are genetically similar to the parent plant and hence have all its characters.  Jasmine, banana.  ","8.2.5 Vegetative Propagation There are many plants in which parts like the root, stem and leaves develop into new plants under appropriate conditions. Unlike in most animals, plants can indeed use such a mode for reproduction. This property of vegetative propagation is used in methods such as layering or grafting to grow many plants like sugarcane, roses, or grapes for agricultural purposes. Plants raised by vegetative propagation can bear flowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds. Such methods also make possible the propagation of plants such as banana, orange, rose and jasmine that have lost the capacity to produce seeds. Another advantage of vegetative propagation is that all plants produced are genetically similar enough to the parent plant to have all its characteristics.

No. 9 (S.A.T.Q-I) Topic-I.)","8.2.4 Budding Organisms such as Hydra use regenerative cells for reproduction in the process of budding. In Hydra, a bud develops as an outgrowth due Figure 8.3 Regeneration in Planaria to repeated cell division at one specific site (Fig. 8.4).

Different organisms reproduce by different methods suitable to their body designs. (i) Justify the above statement using examples of three different organisms which reproduce by different methods of asexual reproduction. (ii) Differentiate between sexual and asexual modes of reproduction.  (),"(i) Amoeba : Binary fission Plasmodium : Multiple fission Hydra : Budding Planaria : Regeneration (Any three + Explain) (ii) Sexual-two parents; Asexual-single parent.  5 		Detailed Answer : (a) (i) Binary Fission in Amoeba—In this method, the nucleus first divides amitotically into two, followed by the division of the cytoplasm. The cell finally splits into two daughter cells. So, from one Amoeba parent, two daughter amoebae are formed. (ii) Budding in Hydra—In Budding, a small part of the body of the parents grows out as a ‘bud’ which then detaches and becomes a new organism. Hydra reproduces by budding using the regenerative cells. A bud develops as an outgrowth in hydra due to repeated cell division at one specific site. When fully mature, the bud detaches itself from the parent body and develops into new independent individuals. (iii) Regeneration in Planaria—In this method, small cut or broken parts of the organisms body grow or regenerate into separate individuals. Planaria can be cut into any number of pieces and each piece grows into a complete organism. (b) Difference between Reproduction : No. Sexual Sexual Reproduction and Asexual Asexual Reproduction (i) Two parents required. are Only one parent is required. (ii) Offsprings are Offsprings are genetically dissimilar identical to parents. from parents.","Reproduction, unlike other life processes, is not essential to maintain the life of an individual organism. Reproduction involves creation of a DNA copy and additional cellular apparatus by the cell involved in the process. Various organisms use different modes of reproduction depending on their body design. In fission, many bacteria and protozoa simply divide into two or more daughter cells. Organisms such as hydra can regenerate if they are broken into pieces. They can also give out buds which mature into new individuals. Roots, stems and leaves of some plants develop into new plants through vegetative propagation. These are examples of asexual reproduction where new generations are created from a single individual. Sexual reproduction involves two individuals for the creation of a new individual. DNA copying mechanisms creates variations which are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. Modes of sexual reproduction allow for greater variation to be generated. Reproduction in flowering plants involves transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma which is referred to as pollination. This is followed by fertilisation. Changes in the body at puberty, such as increase in breast size in girls and new facial hair growth in boys, are signs of sexual maturation. The male reproductive system in human beings consists of testes which produce sperms, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, urethra and penis. The female reproductive system in human beings consists of ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus and vagina. Sexual reproduction in human beings involves the introduction of sperm in the vagina of the female. Fertilisation occurs in the fallopian tube. Contraception to avoid pregnancy can be achieved by the use of condoms, oral pills, copper-T and other methods.

Differentiate between the following : (i) Pollen tube and style. (ii) Fission in Amoeba and Plasmodium (iii) Fragmentation and regeneration (iv) Bud of Hydra and bud of Bryophyllum (v) Vegetative propagation and Spore formation ,"(i) Pollen Tube Style Pollen tube is the part of the male gametophyte in plants. It is a long tube like structure that carries the male gamete from the stigma to the ovules. It is a part of the female reproductive organ, carpel. It joins the stigma to the ovary. It is made up of soft tissues which allows the pollen tube to grow downwards towards the ovule. (ii) Binary fission in Amoeba : A single cell divides itself into two daughter cell is known as binary fission, binary fission can also occur in particular axis. e.g., Amoeba. Multiple fission in Plasmodium : It is also a mode of asexual reproduction in which a cell divides itself into many daughter cells simultaneously. It occur in definite orientation. e.g., yeast , malarial parasites. (iii) Regeneration is of two types, in the first type, a part of the body that gets broken off or cut is regenerated. For example, lizards cast off their tails to escape predators and then regenerate them. The other type of regeneration involve the capacity to give rise to an entire organism from a cut part. It is seen in small invertebrates such as Planaria and Hydra. Fragmentation is also a mode of asexual reproduction. It is the unintentional cutting up of the body of an organism which each grows into different organism. It is most commonly seen in some algae. (iv) In Hydra, the cells divide rapidly at a specific site and develop as an outgrowth called a bud. These buds, while attached to the parent plant, develop into small individuals. When this individual becomes large enough, it detaches itself from the parent body to exist as an independent individual. In the Bryophyllum the leaves have small buds (as in potato). These buds later converts into small and very small plants which also have roots present on them. When these buds start growing further then the leaf becomes heavy and falls on the ground. Then the buds which are present on the leaf dumps into ground and forms a plant. (v) Vegetative propagation : It is the ability of plants to reproduce by producing new plants from vegetative parts such as roots, stem, and leaves. Spore formation : Spore formation is the mode of asexual reproduction in some organisms like fungi in which it gives rise to a globular structure known as sporangia, which contains spores. The sporangia burst to release spores and each of these spores germinates to produce a new individual.

It involves sex cells It does not involve sex or gametes. cells or gametes. Offsprings are not Offsprings are identical i d e n t i c a l t o t h e to the parents. parents. (ii) Sexual reproduction promotes diversity of characters in the offsprings. It result in new combinations of genes brought together in the gamete and this reshuffling increases genetic variation. It plays a prominent role in the origin of new species. The sexual mode of reproduction incorporates process of combining DNA from two different individuals during reproduction.,"8.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION We are also familiar with modes of reproduction that depend on the involvement of two individuals before a new generation can be created. Bulls alone cannot produce new calves, nor can hens alone produce new chicks. In such cases, both sexes, males and females, are needed to produce new generations. What is the significance of this sexual mode of reproduction? Are there any limitations of the asexual mode of reproduction, which we have been discussing above?
 8.3.1 Why the Sexual Mode of Reproduction? The creation of two new cells from one involves copying of the DNA as well as of the cellular apparatus. The DNA copying mechanism, as we have noted, cannot be absolutely accurate, and the resultant errors are a source of variations in populations of organisms. Every individual organism cannot be protected by variations, but in a population, variations are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. It would therefore make sense if organisms came up with reproductive modes that allowed more and more variation to be generated. While DNA-copying mechanisms are not absolutely accurate, they are precise enough to make the generation of variation a fairly slow process. If the DNA copying mechanisms were to be less accurate, many of the resultant DNA copies would not be able to work with the cellular apparatus, and would die. So how can the process of making variants be speeded up? Each new variation is made in a DNA copy that already has variations accumulated from previous generations. Thus, two different individuals in a population would have quite different patterns of accumulated variations. Since all of these variations are in living individuals, it is assured that they do not have any really bad effects. Combining variations from two or more individuals would thus create new combinations of variants. Each combination would be novel, since it would involve two different individuals. The sexual mode of

Many different patterns of fission have been observed. Many bacteria and protozoa simply split into two equal halves during cell division. In organisms such as Amoeba, the splitting of the two cells during division can take place in any plane.
 However, some unicellular organisms show somewhat more organisation of their bodies, such as is seen in Leishmania (which (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) cause kala-azar), which have a whip-like Figure 8.1(b) Binary fission in Leishmania structure at one end of the cell.

(iii) Ionic compounds conduct electricity in molten state. (b) Show the formation of MgO by transfer of electrons. ,"(a) (i) Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points. It is because of strong force of attraction between oppositely charged ions, therefore high energy is required to break the metallic bonds between ions. 		(ii) Ionic compounds are soluble in water because they form ions in aqueous solutions. 		(iii) Ionic compounds conduct electricity in molten state and in aqueous solution because ions carry current. The movement of ions takes place towards oppositely charged electrode in electric field. (b) MgO : → Mg2+ + 2e– → O2– O + 2e–  Mg MgO has Mg or MgO and O ions. ","You may have observed the following general properties for ionic compounds— (i) Physical nature: Ionic compounds are solids and are somewhat hard because of the strong force of attraction between the positive and negative ions. These compounds are generally brittle and break into pieces when pressure is applied. (ii) Melting and Boiling points: Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points (see Table 3.4). This is because a considerable amount of energy is required to break the strong inter-ionic attraction. (iii) Solubility: Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in water and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc. (iv) Conduction of Electricity: The conduction of electricity through a solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solution of an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the opposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the solution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct electricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible due to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct electricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state since the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions are overcome due to the heat. Thus, the ions move freely and conduct electricity.
