"We hear and read about female foeticide, which is really a wrong practice. In some families, be it rural or urban, females are tortured for giving birth to a girl child. They do not seem to understand the scientific reason behind the birth of a boy or a girl. In your opinion, the approach of the society towards mother in this regard is correct or not ?","In rural and uneducated families till today in India female foeticide is a common practice. The females are blamed forgiving birth to a female or girl child. But as per truth and scientific reason the sex of the child is determined by the male as they have XY chromosomes and female body have XX chromosome. If male produces X chromosome the born child will be female and if they produce Y chromosome male child will be born. Hence, we must educate the citizens regarding this through lectures, campaigns etc.","Now you know that the sex chromosomes of the father determine the sex of an unborn baby. The belief that the mother is responsible for the sex of her baby is completely wrong and to blame her for this is totally unjustified.
 the concerns of the community regarding this low ratio. Remember that the chance of having a boy or a girl is equal.

What is the importance of using manure and fertilizers as an agricultral practice ?,Using manure and fertilizers as an agriculture practice is important as continous growth of crops makes the soil poorer in certain nutrients. These both are added to the soil in the form of nutrients for the healthy growth of plants. Manure replenishes the soil with nutrients and also improves water retaining capacity whereas fertilizers make soil rich in a particular nutrient. They also help farmers to get better yield of crops.,"better growth of plants? In which glass was the growth fastest? Fertilisers are chemicals which are rich in a particular nutrient. How are they different from manure? Fertilisers are produced in factories. Some examples of fertilisers are— urea, ammonium sulphate, super phosphate, potash, NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium). The use of fertilisers has helped farmers to get better yield of crops such as wheat, paddy and maize. But excessive use of fertilisers has made the soil less fertile. Fertilisers have also become a source of water pollution. Therefore, in order to maintain the fertility of the soil, we have to substitute fertilisers with organic manure or leave the field uncultivated (fallow) in between two crops. The use of manure improves soil texture as well as its water retaining capacity. It replenishes the soil with nutrients. Another method of replenishing the soil with nutrients is through crop rotation. This can be done by growing different crops alternately. Earlier, farmers in northern India used to grow legumes as fodder in one season and wheat in the next season. This helped in the replenishment of the soil with nitrogen. Farmers are being encouraged to adopt this practice. In the previous classes, you have learnt about Rhizobium bacteria. These are present in the nodules of roots of leguminous plants. They fix atmospheric nitrogen.

Corrosion is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is spent to replace damaged iron. What steps can be taken to prevent this damage ?,"The wasting of iron objects due to rusting causes a big loss to the country’s economy, so it must be prevented by following methods :  By painting : Paint is applied to the surface of an iron object, then air and moisture cannot come in contact of iron and hence no rusting or oil to prevent their rusting.  By applying grease or oil : Tools and machine parts made of iron and steel are smeared with grease or oil to prevent their rusting.  By galvanisation : Galvanisation is done by dipping an iron object in molten zinc metal. This thin layer of zinc metal on the surface of iron objects protects them from rusting.  By tin plating and chromium-plating : When a thin layer of tin metal is deposited on iron and steel objects by electroplating, then","The process of depositing a layer of any desired metal on another material by means of electricity is called electroplating. It is one of the most common applications of chemical effects of electric current. Electroplating is a very useful process. It is widely used in industry for coating metal objects with a thin layer of a different metal (Fig.14.8). The layer of metal deposited has some desired property, which the metal of the object lacks. For example, chromium plating is done on many objects such as car parts, bath taps, kitchen gas burners, bicycle handlebars, wheel rims and many others. Chromium has a shiny appearance. It does not corrode. It resists scratches. However, chromium is expensive and it may not be economical to make the whole object out of chromium. So the object is made from a cheaper metal and only a coating of chromium over it is deposited. Jewellery makers electroplate

 silver and gold on less expensive metals. These ornaments have the appearance of silver or gold but are much less expensive. Tin cans, used for storing food, are made by electroplating tin onto iron. Tin is less reactive than iron. Thus, food does not come into contact with iron and is protected from getting spoilt. Iron is used in bridges and automobiles to provide strength. However, iron tends to corrode and rust. So, a coating of zinc is deposited on iron to protect it from corrosion and formation of rust. In the electroplating factories the disposal of the used conducting solution is a major concern. It is a polluting waste and there are specific disposal guidelines to protect the environment. 179

Why your parents poured few drops of oil on the hinges of a door.,Actually friction is a one kind of force caused by the irregularities on the two surface in contact. We have to do lot of work in some cases. We need to decrease the friction and in some cases we need to increase the friction. While playing carrom board we need smooth and slippary movement so we sprinkle fine powder to decrease the friction. Same as for the smooth movement of doors oil drops are poured on the hinges of a door.,"In some situations, however, friction is undesirable and we would want to minimise it. Why do you sprinkle fine powder on the carrom board (Fig. 12.12)? You might have noticed that when a few drops of oil are poured on the hinges of a door, the door moves smoothly.

Development of these habits is environment friendly. Reduce the use of  plastic as it is a non-biodegradable substance. Reuse such plastic which get deformed easily on heating and can be reshaped in any form. Recycling also reduces the cost of articles and saves resources.  I can contribute at my own level to save the environment as follows : — I will not throw plastic bags in the water bodies or on the road. — I will take a cotton bag or a jute bag while going for shopping. — I will try to minimize the use of plastic materials e.g., use a steel lunch box instead of a plastic one.","Since plastic takes several years to decompose, it is not environment friendly. It causes environmental pollution. Besides, the burning process in the synthetic material is quite slow and it does not get completely burnt easily. In the process it releases lots of poisonous fumes into the atmosphere causing air pollution. How can this problem be solved? Have you ever seen a garbage dump where animals are eating garbage? In the process of eating the food waste they swallow materials like polythene bags and wrappers of food. Can you imagine the consequences? The plastic material chokes the respiratory system of these animals, or forms a lining in their stomachs and can be the cause of their death. The polybags carelessly thrown here and there are responsible for clogging the drains, too. Sometimes we are very careless and throw the wrappers of chips, biscuits and other eatables on the road or in parks or picnic places. Should we not think twice before doing so ? As a responsible citizen what measures do you suggest to keep public places clean and free of plastic?
 Avoid the use of plastics as far as possible. Make use of bags made of cotton or jute when you go for shopping.
