With the help of three examples show how communities have carried out conservation of flora and fauna in India ?,"In some areas of India, local communities are struggling to conserve these habitats alongwith government officials reognizing that only this will secure their own long-term livelihood. It is proved by the following examples :  In Sariska Tiger Reserve, Rajasthan, villagers have fought against mining by citing the Wildlife Protection Act. In many areas, villagers themselves are protecting habitats and explicitly rejecting government involvement.  The inhabitants of five villages in the Alwar district of Rajasthan have declared 1,200 hectares of forest as the Bhairodev Dakar ‘Sonchuri’, declaring their own set of rules and regulations which do not allow hunting, and are protecting the wildlife against any outside encroachments.  The famous Chipko Movement in the Himalayas has not only successfully resisted deforestation in several areas but has also shown that community afforestation with indigeneous species can be enormously successful.  Farmers and citizens’ groups such as the Beej Bachao Andolan in Tehri and Navdanya have shown that adequate levels of diversified crop production without the use of synthetic chemicals are possible and economically viable.   ","Conservation strategies are not new in our country. We often ignore that in India, forests are also home to some of the traditional communities.

Why is it necessary to increase the area of forest in India? ,"It is necessary to increase the area of forest in India because :  So far forest area is below the recommended ratio of 33% to total geographical area. 3-  To combat global warming, ozone depletion and tsunami like disaster.  A number of animals and plant species are endangered or extinct due to depletion of forests.","Conservation in the background of rapid decline in wildlife population and forestry has become essential. But why do we need to conserve our forests and wildlife? Conservation preserves the ecological diversity and our life support systems – water, air and soil. It also preserves the genetic diversity of plants and animals for better growth of species and breeding. For example, in agriculture, we are still dependent on traditional crop varieties. Fisheries too are heavily dependent on the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity. In the 1960s and 1970s, conservationists demanded a national wildlife protection programme. The Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act was implemented in 1972, with various provisions for protecting habitats. A n allIndia list of protected species was also published. The thrust of the programme was towards protecting the remaining population of certain endangered species by banning hunting, giving legal protection to their habitats, and restricting trade in wildlife. Subsequently, central and many state governments established national parks and wildlife sanctuaries about which you have already studied. The central government also announced several projects for protecting specific animals, which were gravely threatened, including the tiger, the onehorned rhinoceros, the Kashmir stag or hangul, three types of crocodiles – fresh water crocodile, saltwater crocodile and the Gharial, the Asiatic lion, and others. Most recently, the Indian elephant, black buck (chinkara), the great Indian bustard (godawan) and the snow leopard, etc. have been given full or partial legal protection against hunting and trade throughout India.

Explain any three human activities responsible for land degradation in India.  Or 		How are human activities responsible for the degradation of land ? ," Mining : Mining sites are abandoned after excavation work is complete leaving deep scars in states such as Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. Deforestation due to mining has caused severe land degradation.  Over irrigation : Over irrigation in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh, has caused water logging and increase in salinity of soil. 3-  Overgrazing : Overgrazing in states such as Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra is a huge cause due to cattle population.  Industries : Mineral processing industry like grinding of limestone for cement industry and calcite and soapstone for ceramic industry generate huge quantity of dust, this retards the process of infiltration of water into the soil.  Industrial Waste : Industrial effluents also have become a major source of land degradation.   ","the fringes of these forests depends upon it. A part of the land is termed as waste land and land put to other non-agricultural uses. Waste land includes rocky, arid and desert areas and land put to other non-agricultural uses includes settlements, roads, railways, industry etc. Continuous use of land over a long period of time without taking appropriate measures to conserve and manage it, has resulted in land degradation. This, in turn, has serious repercussions on society and the environment.
 There are many ways to solve the problems of land degradation. Afforestation and proper management of grazing can help to some extent. Planting of shelter belts of plants, control on over grazing, stabilisation of sand dunes by growing thorny bushes are some of the methods to check land degradation in arid areas. Proper management of waste lands, control of mining activities, proper discharge and disposal of industrial effluents and wastes after treatment can reduce land and water degradation in industrial and suburban areas.
 We have shared our land with the past generations and will have to do so with the future generations too. Ninety-five per cent of our basic needs for food, shelter and clothing are obtained from land. Human activities have not only brought about degradation of land but have also aggravated the pace of natural forces to cause damage to land. Some human activities such as deforestation, over grazing, mining and quarrying too have contributed significantly in land degradation. Mining sites are abandoned after excavation work is complete leaving deep scars and traces of over-burdening. In states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha deforestation due to mining have caused severe land degradation. In states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra overgrazing is one of the main reasons for land degradation. In the states of Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh, over irrigation is responsible for land degradation due to water logging leading to increase in salinity and alkalinity in the soil. The mineral processing like grinding of limestone for cement industry and calcite and soapstone for ceramic industry generate huge quantity of dust in the atmosphere. It retards the process of infiltration of water into the soil after it settles down on the land. In recent years, industrial effluents as waste have become a major source of land and water pollution in many parts of the country.

“Gender division is not based on Biology but on social expectations and stereotypes.” Support the statement.  			 ," Gender division is a form of hierarchical social division based on social expectation and stereotypes.  Boys and girls are brought up to believe that the main responsibility of women is house work and bringing up children.  There is a sexual division of labour in most families where women do all work outside the home.  Majority of women do some paid work in addition to domestic labour both in rural and urban areas but their work is not valued and does not get recognition.  Women constitute half of the humanity, their role in public life, especially politics is minimal in most societies.  In our country, women still lag behind men as ours is still a male dominated patriarchal society. Women face disadvantage, discrimination and oppression in various ways.   ","Sexual division of labour: A system in which all work inside the home is either done by the women of the family, or organised by them through the domestic helpers.
 Why are we discussing things like household work in this textbook on Political Science? Is this politics?
 Let us begin with gender division. This is a form of hierarchical social division seen everywhere, but is rarely recognised in the study of politics. The gender division tends to be understood as natural and unchangeable. However, it is not based on biology but on social expectations and stereotypes.
 Boys and girls are brought up to believe that the main responsibility of women is housework and bringing up children. This is reflected in a SEXUAL DIVISION OF LABOUR in most families: women do all work inside the home such as cooking, cleaning, washing clothes, tailoring, looking after children, etc., and men do all the work outside the home. It is not that men cannot do housework; they simply think that it is for women to attend to these things. When these jobs are paid for, men are ready to take up these works. Most tailors or cooks in hotels are men. Similarly, it is not that women do not work outside their home. In villages, women fetch water, collect fuel and work in the fields. In urban areas, poor women work as domestic helper in middle class homes, while middle class women work in offices. In fact the majority of women do some sort of paid work in addition to domestic labour. But their work is not valued and does not get recognition. The result of this division of labour is that although women constitute half of the humanity, their role in public life, especially politics, is minimal in most societies. Earlier, only men were allowed to participate in public affairs, vote and contest for public offices. Gradually the gender issue was raised in politics. Women in different parts of the world organised and agitated for equal rights. There were agitations in different countries for the extension of voting rights to women. These agitations demanded enhancing the political and legal status of women and improving

Literacy and urbanisation combined with economic growth have changed the value system of Indian society. Explain with reference to India’s social problems. 3-, The caste system is very old in India and was also very rigid at one time but due to literacy and economic development these caste barriers are breaking down. People in urban areas who are literate mostly do not believe in inequality based on caste. It is accepted that all are equal. Rising economic status of backward castes has helped to erode caste lines.  The problem of communalism has decreased and there is less violence in the name of religion. People who are literate mostly do not get swayed by appeal to religious emotions. Economic progress and urbanisation has greatly helped to cultivate the secular mindset.  The position of women too has improved with the spread of literacy among women. Now they can earn and be economically independent. This helps to increase self-esteem and decreases dependence on male members of society.  The system of dowry at the time of marriage is getting diluted due to literacy and economic development of women.  The practice of child marriage is decreasing due to spread of literacy.  There is occupational mobility due to spread of urbanisation and literacy and people are free to follow the profession of their choice rather than follow hereditary professions. ,"Partly due to their efforts and partly due to other socio-economic changes, castes and caste system in modern India have undergone great changes. With economic development, large scale URBANISATION, growth of literacy and education, OCCUPATIONAL MOBILITY and the weakening of the position of landlords in the villages, the old notions of CASTE HIERARCHY are breaking down. Now, most of the times, in urban areas it does not matter much who is walking along next to us on a street or eating at the next table in a restaurant. The Constitution of India prohibited any caste-based discrimination and laid the foundations of policies to reverse the injustices of the caste system. If a person who lived a century ago were to return to India, she would be greatly surprised at the change that has come about in the country. Yet caste has not disappeared from contemporary India. Some of the older aspects of caste have persisted. Even now most people marry within their own caste or tribe. Untouchability has not ended completely, despite constitutional prohibition. Effects of centuries of advantages and disadvantages continue to be felt today. The caste groups that had access to education under the old system have done very well in acquiring modern education as well. Those groups that did not have access to education or were prohibited from acquiring it have naturally lagged behind. That is why there is a disproportionately large presence of ‘upper caste’ among the urban middle classes in our country. Caste continues to

Do you think that social divisions are always dangerous ? Explain. ,"No, we do not think that social divisions are always dangerous because :    In a democracy, political expression of social divisions is normal and can be healthy. It allows various disadvantaged and marginal social groups to express their grievances and get the government to attend to these.

What lessons have been learnt from the Civil Rights Movement of Martin Luther King in the USA ?, People learnt that issues such as discrimination on the basis of colour existed in many regions of the world and especially in the USA.  The issue of equality was much discussed and it was realized that equality is a dream for many sections of society in different countries with parallel problems.  People learnt that through a non-violent protest it was possible to highlight a social problem and find solutions for the same.  It is only in a democracy that disadvantaged sections of society are able to highlight their problems and find solutions.,"Democracy and Diversity
 Democracy and Diversity
 In the last chapter, we saw how power can be distributed to accommodate linguistic and regional diversities. But language and region are not the only features that give a distinct identity to people. Sometimes, people also identify themselves and relate with others on the basis of their physical appearance, class, religion, gender, caste, tribe, etc. In this chapter, we study how democracy responds to social differences, divisions and inequalities. We begin with an example of public expression of social divisions. We then draw some general lessons about how social differences can take various forms. We then turn to how democratic politics affects and is affected by these social diversities.
 But a positive attitude towards diversity and a willingness to accommodate it do not come about easily. People who feel marginalised, deprived and discriminated have to fight against the injustices. Such a fight often takes the democratic path, voicing their demands in a peaceful and constitutional manner and seeking a fair position through elections. Sometimes social differences can take the form of unacceptable level of social inequality and injustice. The struggle against such inequalities sometimes takes the path of violence and defiance of state power. However history shows that democracy is the best way to fight for recognition and also to accommodate diversity.

Why Kerala has a better human development ranking than Punjab in spite of lower per capita income ? ,Kerala has a better human development ranking than Punjab inspite of lower per capita income because it has adequate provision of basic health and educational facility. This results in :  Lower mortality rate.  Higher literacy rate.  Gross Enrolment ratio is higher.,"Kerala has a low Infant Mortality Rate because it has adequate provision of basic health and educational facilities. Similarly, in some states, the
 Public Distribution System (PDS) functions well. Health and nutritional status of people of such states is certainly likely to be better.
 LET’S WORK THESE OUT 1. Look at data in Tables 1.3 and 1.4. Is Haryana ahead of Kerala in literacy rate etc., as it is in terms of per capita income? 2. Think of other examples where collective provision of goods and services is cheaper than individual provision. 3. Does availability of good health and educational facilities depend only on amount of money spent by the government on these facilities? What other factors could be relevant? 4. In Tamil Nadu, 90 per cent of the people living in rural areas use a ration shop, whereas in West Bengal only 35 per cent of rural people do so. Where would people be better off and why?

Explain the main achievements of the Government of India in the improvement of health status of the people after 1947.,"Efforts made by the Government in the field of health can be summarised as follows : The life expectancy of birth in India has more than doubled in the last fifty years. It has reached nearly 62 years.  In the plan-period, the mortality rate has declined to nearly 9 per thousand and infant mortality has come down to 70 per thousand live births. Similarly, maternal mortality rate has also declined.  Efforts have been made to overcome the nutritional problems in the country and considerable progress has been achieved.  Smallpox has been completely eradicated and malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, filaria, etc. have also been controlled to a large extent. 3-","What does this table show? The first column of the table shows that in Kerala, out of 1000 children born, 10 died before completing one year of age but in Haryana the proportion of children dying within one year of birth was 30, which is two times more than that of Kerala. On the other hand, the per capita income of Haryana is more than that of Kerala as shown in Table 1.3. Just think of how dear you are to your parents, think of how every one is so happy when a child is born. Now, try to think of parents whose children die before they even celebrate their first birthday. How painful it must be to these parents? Next, note the year to which this data pertains. It is 2017. So we are not talking of old times; it is 70 years after independence when our metro cities are full of high rise buildings and shopping malls!
 The problem does not end with Infant Mortality Rate. The last column of table 1.4 shows around half of the children aged 14-15 in Bihar are not attending school beyond Class 8. This means that if you went to school in Bihar nearly half of your elementary class would be missing. Those who could have been in school are not there! If this had happened to you, you would not be able to read what you are reading now.

How to create more employment in rural areas ? Explain with the help of five suitable examples.  Or 		How can more employment opportunities be created in the rural areas ?  3-," Government can spend money or banks can provide loan for irrigation.  Suppose one hectare of wheat can provide employment to the people for 50 days. So, the number of members can be increased. Examples :  Construction of new dams and canals. Constructing dams, canals or digging wells in villages. On one hand, this would serve the needs of farmers for irrigation and on the other, people engaged in such construction activity would gain employment.  Development in transport facility by government and creating storage facilities in rural areas.  Credit from local banks, so that crops can be grown every year.  Agro-based industries can be set up in rural areas or semi-rural belts.

 Now, suppose Laxmi and other farmers produce much more than before. They would also need to sell some of this. For this they may be required to transport their products to a nearby town. If the government invests some money in transportation and storage of crops, or makes better rural roads so that mini-trucks reach everywhere several farmers like Laxmi, who now have access to water, can continue to grow and sell these crops. This activity can provide productive employment to not just farmers but also others such as those in services like transport or trade.
