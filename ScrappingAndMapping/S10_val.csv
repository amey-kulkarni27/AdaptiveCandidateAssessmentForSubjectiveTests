"Ethanol, commonly called as ‘alcohol’ is an excellent solvent, it is used in medicines and is an important chemical compound involved in synthesis of many chemical compounds. However is in spite of its benefits to man, its impact on social behaviour has always been questioned. Media has often shown abnormal behaviour of people while drunk. It is considered as a curse in the lives of those who are addicted to alcohol. ‘Alcoholic’ people are not only lowering their metabolism and affecting central nervous system, they are also a threat to the liver of others. Anger and rude behaviour are some of its ill effects. (i) Comment on the statement : ‘Should production of alcohol be banned’. Give three valid reasons to justify. (ii) As a student, what initiative would you take in the common concern of ‘Save Life, Do not Drink’. Give two suggestions.",(i) In favour of negative response : (a) It is an excellent industrial solvent. (b) It is used in so many ways such as in medicines and ornamentation. (c) It is used as a disinfectant. In favour of positive response : (a) It is the reason behind deaths of many people. (b) Many adolescents get affected out of it and become addicted. (c) It is being misused even where it is of important use. (ii) Initiatives : (a) Drive to increase awareness among people with the help of skit / role plays / drama / article writing. (b) Chart preparation and slogan writing.,"Awareness about the problems caused by unthinkingly exploiting our resources has been a fairly recent phenomenon in our society. And once this awareness rises, some action is usually taken. You must have heard about the Ganga Action Plan. This multi-crore project came about in 1985 because the quality of the water in the Ganga was very poor. Coliform is a group of bacteria, found in human intestines, whose presence in water indicates contamination by disease-causing microorganisms.

"A balanced diet should contain carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, water and roughage in adequate amounts. Junk food is an informal term applied to some foods which are perceived to have little or no nutritional value, or to products with nutritional value but which also have ingredients considered unhealthy when regularly eaten or those considered unhealthy to consume at all. It includes food that are high in salt, sugar, fat or calories and low in nutrient content. (i) What is malnutrition ? (ii) Evaluate the relationship between ‘Junk food and Health.’","(i) Malnutrition is a condition that results from eating a diet in which nutrients are either not enough or are too much, it may either be called undernutrition or overnutrition. (ii) Relationship between Junk food and health is antagonistic. 			 (a) Junk food does not provide proper nutrition. 			 (b) Eating more junk food can lead to obesity. 			 (c) This may eventually lead to heart disease. 2","6.2.2 Heterotrophic Nutrition Each organism is adapted to its environment. The form of nutrition differs depending on the type and availability of food material as well as how it is obtained by the organism. For example, whether the food source is stationary (such as grass) or mobile (such as a deer), would allow for differences in how the food is accessed and what is the nutritive apparatus used by a cow and a lion. There is a range of strategies by which the food is taken in and used by the organism. Some organisms break-down the food material outside the body and then absorb it. Examples are fungi like bread moulds, yeast and mushrooms. Others take in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can be taken in and broken down depends on the body design and functioning. Some other organisms derive nutrition from plants or animals without killing them. This parasitic nutritive strategy is used by a wide variety of organisms like cuscuta (amar-bel), ticks, lice, leeches and tape-worms.
 6.2.3 How do Organisms obtain their Nutrition? Since the food and the way it is obtained differ, the digestive system is different in various organisms. In single-celled organisms, the food may be taken in by the entire surface. But as the complexity of the organism increases, different parts become specialised to perform different functions. For example, Amoeba takes in food using temporary finger-like extensions of the cell surface which fuse over the food particle forming a food-vacuole (Fig. 6.5). Inside the foodvacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones which then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested material is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In Paramoecium, which is also a unicellular organism, the cell has a definite shape and food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved to this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface of the cell. Figure 6.5 Nutrition in Amoeba
 6.2.4 Nutrition in Human Beings The alimentary canal is basically a long tube extending from the mouth to the anus. In Fig. 6.6, we can see that the tube has different parts. Various regions are specialised to perform different functions. What happens to the food once it enters our body? We shall discuss this process here.
 1.3.2 Rancidity Have you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left for a long time? When fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell and taste change. Usually substances which prevent oxidation (antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food in air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Do you know that chips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as nitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised ?

"Om, Rohit and Kishore always remain in a hurry. One day, during lunch hour they all quickly gulped food and went out to play. Om suddenly developed stomach ache while playing. What according to you might have gone wrong with him.",Om developed stomach ache as he had not chewed his food properly. Chewing food properly helps in proper breakdown of food and mixing it with saliva. Large food pieces if enter the stomach might cause damage. Associated Value : The learners will start chewing their food properly for healthy digestion.,"We eat various types of food which has to pass through the same digestive tract. Naturally the food has to be processed to generate particles which are small and of the same texture. This is achieved by crushing the food with our teeth. Since the lining of the canal is soft, the food is also wetted to make its passage smooth. When we eat something we like, our mouth ‘waters’. This is actually not only water, but a fluid called saliva secreted by the salivary glands. Another aspect of the food we ingest is its complex nature. If it is to be absorbed from the alimentary canal, it has to be broken into smaller molecules. This is done with the help of biological catalysts called enzymes. The saliva contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that breaks down starch which is a complex molecule to give simple sugar. The food is mixed thoroughly with saliva and moved around the mouth while chewing by the muscular tongue. It is necessary to move the food in a regulated manner along the digestive tube so that it can be processed properly in each part. The lining of canal has muscles that contract rhythmically in order to push the food forward. These peristaltic movements occur all along the gut. From the mouth, the food is taken to the stomach through the food-pipe or oesophagus. The stomach is a large organ which expands when food enters it. The muscular walls of the stomach help in mixing the food Figure 6.6 Human alimentary canal thoroughly with more digestive juices. The digestion in stomach is taken care of by the gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach. These release hydrochloric acid, a protein digesting enzyme called pepsin, and mucus. The hydrochloric acid creates an acidic medium which facilitates the action of the enzyme pepsin. What other function do you think is served by the acid? The mucus protects the inner lining of the stomach from the action of the acid under normal conditions. We
 have often heard adults complaining about ‘acidity’. Can this be related to what has been discussed above? The exit of food from the stomach is regulated by a sphincter muscle which releases it in small amounts into the small intestine. From the stomach, the food now enters the small intestine. This is the longest part of the alimentary canal which is fitted into a compact space because of extensive coiling. The length of the small intestine differs in various animals depending on the food they eat. Herbivores eating grass need a longer small intestine to allow the cellulose to be digested. Meat is easier to digest, hence carnivores like tigers have a shorter small intestine. The small intestine is the site of the complete digestion of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. It receives the secretions of the liver and pancreas for this purpose. The food coming from the stomach is acidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act. Bile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats. Fats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes it difficult for enzymes to act on them. Bile salts break them down into smaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action. This is similar to the emulsifying action of soaps on dirt that we have learnt about in Chapter 4. The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which contains enzymes like trypsin for digesting proteins and lipase for breaking down emulsified fats. The walls of the small intestine contain glands which secrete intestinal juice. The enzymes present in it finally convert the proteins to amino acids, complex carbohydrates into glucose and fats into fatty acids and glycerol. Digested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner lining of the small intestine has numerous finger-like projections called villi which increase the surface area for absorption. The villi are richly supplied with blood vessels which take the absorbed food to each and every cell of the body, where it is utilised for obtaining energy, building up new tissues and the repair of old tissues. The unabsorbed food is sent into the large intestine where its wall absorb more water from this material. The rest of the material is removed from the body via the anus. The exit of this waste material is regulated by the anal sphincter.
 Dental caries Dental caries or tooth decay causes gradual softening of enamel and dentine. It begins when bacteria acting on sugars produce acids that softens or demineralises the enamel. Masses of bacterial cells together with food particles stick to the teeth to form dental plaque. Saliva cannot reach the tooth surface to neutralise the acid as plaque covers the teeth. Brushing the teeth after eating removes the plaque before the bacteria produce acids. If untreated, microorganisms may invade the pulp, causing inflammation and infection.

We have all seen salt packets which say ‘iodised salt’ or ‘enriched with iodine’. Why is it important for us to have iodised salt in our diet? Iodine is necessary for the thyroid gland to make thyroxin hormone. Thyroxin regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism in the body so as to provide the best balance for growth. Iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroxin. In case iodine is deficient in our diet, there is a possibility that we might suffer from goitre. One of the symptoms in this disease is a swollen neck. Can you correlate this with the position of the thyroid gland in Fig. 7.7? Sometimes we come across people who are either very short (dwarfs) or extremely tall (giants). Have you ever wondered how this happens? Growth hormone is one of the hormones secreted by the pituitary. As its name indicates, growth hormone regulates growth and development of the body. If there is a deficiency of this hormone in childhood, it leads to dwarfism. You must have noticed many dramatic changes in your appearance as well as that of your friends as you approached 10–12 years of age. These changes associated with puberty are because of the secretion of testosterone in males and oestrogen in females. Do you know anyone in your family or friends who has been advised by the doctor to take less sugar in their diet because they are suffering from diabetes? As a treatment, they might be taking injections of insulin. This is a hormone which is produced by the pancreas and helps in regulating blood sugar levels. If it is not secreted in proper amounts, the sugar level in the blood rises causing many harmful effects.

Exploiting any source of energy disturbs the environment in some way or the other. In any given situation, the source we would choose depends on factors such as the ease of extracting energy from that source, the economics of extracting energy from the source, the efficiency of the technology available and the environmental damage that will be caused by using that source. Though we talk of ‘clean’ fuels like CNG, it would be more exact to say that a particular source is cleaner than the other. We have already seen that burning fossil fuels causes air pollution. In some cases, the actual operation of a device like the solar cell may be pollution-free, but the assembly of the device would have caused some environmental damage. Research continues in these areas to produce longer lasting devices that will cause less damage throughout their life.

You are going through the Science notebook of your brother. You suddenly come across a question stating ‘what is the reason behind regular formation of cramps in cricketers ? Your brother stated the answer as ‘ cramps are developed due to tear in ligament’. Is this answer correct ? State reasons for your answers.,"No, the answer is not correct. Sometimes during rigorous physical work or exercise the amount of oxygen declines in our muscle cells. At this time when the oxygen is less in amount, pyruvate breaks down in insufficient oxygen and form lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide and water. Cramps are formed in the body of cricketers due to the sudden formation of lactic acid.","process breaks up the three-carbon pyruvate molecule to give three molecules of carbon dioxide. The other product is water. Since this process takes place in the presence of air (oxygen), it is called aerobic respiration. The release of energy in this aerobic process is a lot greater than in the anaerobic process. Sometimes, when there is a lack of oxygen in our muscle cells, another pathway for the break-down of pyruvate is taken. Here the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid which is also a three-carbon molecule. This build-up of lactic acid in our muscles during sudden activity causes cramps.

The pressure of blood inside the artery during ventricular systole (contraction) is called systolic pressure and pressure in artery during ventricular diastole (relaxation) is called diastolic pressure. The normal systolic pressure is about 120 mm of Hg and diastolic pressure is 80 mm of Hg.
 Blood pressure is measured with an instrument called sphygmomanometer. High blood pressure is also called hypertension and is caused by the constriction of arterioles, which results in increased resistance to blood flow. It can lead to the rupture of an artery and internal bleeding.

 Figure 9.6 Sex determination in human beings
 We have discussed the idea that the two sexes participating in sexual reproduction must be somewhat different from each other for a number of reasons. How is the sex of a newborn individual determined? Different species use very different strategies for this. Some rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus, in some animals like a few reptiles, the temperature at which fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the animals developing in the eggs will be male or female. In other animals, such as snails, individuals can change sex, indicating that sex is not genetically determined. However, in human beings, the sex of the individual is largely genetically determined. In other words, the genes inherited from our parents decide whether we will be boys or girls. But so far, we have assumed that similar gene sets are inherited from both parents. If that is the case, how can genetic inheritance determine sex? The explanation lies in the fact that all human chromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes have a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22 such pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is odd in not always being a perfect pair. Women have a perfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men have a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X while the other is a short one called Y. So women are XX, while men are XY. Now, can we work out what the inheritance pattern of X and Y will be? As Fig. 9.6 shows, half the children will be boys and half will be girls. All children will inherit an X chromosome from their mother regardless of whether they are boys or girls. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by what they inherit from their father. A child who inherits an X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one who inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy.

"Reproductive process gives rise to new individuals that are similar but with some variations. Thus, the similarities between parents and their offsprings are due to heredity and the dissimilarities are due to ‘variation’. Continuity of life is maintained through heredity and evolution. (i) What do you mean by variation ? (ii) Why is variation beneficial for the species, but not necessary for the individual ?",(i) Variation refers to the difference in the characters or traits among the individuals of a species. (ii) Variation enables the organisms to adapt themselves in changing environment. It form the basis of heredity. They form raw materials for evolution and development of new species.,"e have seen that reproductive processes give rise to new individuals that are similar, but subtly different. We have discussed how some amount of variation is produced even during asexual reproduction. And the number of successful variations are maximised by the process of sexual reproduction. If we observe a field of sugarcane we find very little variations among the individual plants. But in a number of animals including human beings, which reproduce sexually, quite distinct variations are visible among different individuals. In this chapter, we shall be studying the mechanism by which variations are created and inherited. The long-term consequences of the accumulation of variations are also an interesting point to be considered. We shall be studying this under evolution.
 9 . 1 A CCUMUL ATION OF V VARIA ARIATION ARIA TION DURING REPRODUCTION
 Figure 9.1 Creation of diversity over succeeding generations. The original organism at the top will give rise to, say, two individuals, similar in body design, but with subtle differences. Each of them, in turn, will give rise to two individuals in the next generation. Each of the four individuals in the bottom row will be different from each other. While some of these differences will be unique, others will be inherited from their respective parents, who were different from each other.
 8.1.1 The Importance of Variation Populations of organisms fill well-defined places, or niches, in the ecosystem, using their ability to reproduce. The consistency of DNA copying during reproduction is important for the maintenance of body design features that allow the organism to use that particular niche. Reproduction is therefore linked to the stability of populations of species. However, niches can change because of reasons beyond the control of the organisms. Temperatures on earth can go up or down, water levels can vary, or there could be meteorite hits, to think of a few examples. If a population of reproducing organisms were suited to a particular niche and if the niche were drastically altered, the population could be wiped out. However, if some variations were to be present in a few individuals in these populations, there would be some chance for them to survive. Thus, if there were a population of bacteria living in temperate waters, and if the water temperature were to be increased by global warming, most of these bacteria would die, but the few variants resistant to heat would survive and grow further. Variation is thus useful for the survival of species over time.

"It is a disgrace for the Indian society which consider birth of a girl child as burden. This narrow view point of the Indian patriarchal society has lead to the horrified practice of female foeticide. Escalating demands for dowry is considered as the main reason behind it.

 We must also consider the possible health consequences of having sex. We have discussed in Class IX that diseases can be transmitted from person to person in a variety of ways. Since the sexual act is a very intimate connection of bodies, it is not surprising that many diseases can be sexually transmitted. These include bacterial infections such as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as warts and HIV-AIDS. Is it possible to prevent the transmission of such diseases during the sexual act? Using a covering, called a condom, for the penis during sex helps to prevent transmission of many of these infections to some extent. The sexual act always has the potential to lead to pregnancy. Pregnancy will make major demands on the body and the mind of the woman, and if she is not ready for it, her health will be adversely affected. Therefore, many ways have been devised to avoid pregnancy. These contraceptive methods fall in a number of categories. One category is the creation of a mechanical barrier so that sperm does not reach the egg. Condoms on the penis or similar coverings worn in the vagina can serve this purpose. Another category of contraceptives acts by changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not released and fertilisation cannot occur. These drugs commonly need to be taken orally as pills. However, since they change hormonal balances, they can cause side-effects too. Other contraceptive devices such as the loop or the copper-T are placed in the uterus to prevent pregnancy. Again, they can cause side effects due to irritation of the uterus. If the vas deferens in the male is blocked, sperm transfer will be prevented. If the fallopian tube in the female is blocked, the egg will not be able to reach the uterus. In both cases fertilisation will not take place. Surgical methods can be used to create such blocks. While surgical methods are safe in the long run, surgery itself can cause infections and other problems if not performed properly. Surgery can also be used for removal of unwanted pregnancies. These may be misused by people who do not want a particular child, as happens in illegal sex-selective abortion of female foetuses. For a healthy society, the female-male sex ratio must be maintained. Because of reckless female foeticides, child sex ratio is declining at an alarming rate in some sections of our society, although prenatal sex determination has been prohibited by law. We have noted earlier that reproduction is the process by which organisms increase their populations. The rates of birth and death in a given population will determine its size. The size of the human population is a cause for concern for many people. This is because an expanding population makes it harder to improve everybody’s standard of living. However, if inequality in society is the main reason for poor standards of living for many people, the size of the population is relatively unimportant. If we look around us, what can we identify as the most important reason(s) for poor living standards? 139

"While playing near a sugarcane field, Mohan noticed that the plants are almost similar to one another.

Mango reproduces sexually, hence there is larger variation. (i) Why sugarcane cannot reproduce sexually ? (ii) Can mango reproduce asexually ? (iii) If a person wants to have a flower garden, what type of plants should he grow ?","(i) Because they do not bear flowers. (ii) Yes, by grafting and layering. (iii) Since, the flower garden will be ornamental in natural, the person should plant saplings which are obtained from the same parent asexually. This will give a uniform look to his garden.","8.2.5 Vegetative Propagation There are many plants in which parts like the root, stem and leaves develop into new plants under appropriate conditions. Unlike in most animals, plants can indeed use such a mode for reproduction. This property of vegetative propagation is used in methods such as layering or grafting to grow many plants like sugarcane, roses, or grapes for agricultural purposes. Plants raised by vegetative propagation can bear flowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds. Such methods also make possible the propagation of plants such as banana, orange, rose and jasmine that have lost the capacity to produce seeds. Another advantage of vegetative propagation is that all plants produced are genetically similar enough to the parent plant to have all its characteristics.

"Fossils are the remains, traces or impression of the dead animals and plants of geological past. Fossils are formed layer by layer in the earth’s crust. Fossils of prokaryotes were found in older rocks than those of eukaryotes. Invertebrates were formed before vertebrates. Among vertebrates, fishes appeared earlier than amphibians and amphibians appeared earlier than reptiles, which are earlier than birds and mammals. Thus, fossils provide evidence for evolution. (i) What is the main factor on which formation of fossil depends ? (ii) What is fossil dating ? Why the study of fossils important ?",(i) Decomposition of organisms. (ii) The age of fossils can be estimated by fossil dating. 1 The study of fossils is important because : (i) It helps to analyse racial history of plants and animals. (ii) It helps to measure the geological time.,"How do we know how old the fossils are? There are two components to this estimation. One is relative. If we dig into the earth and start finding fossils, it is reasonable to suppose that the fossils we find closer to the surface are more recent than the fossils we find in deeper layers. The second way of dating fossils is by detecting the ratios of different isotopes of the same element in the fossil material. It would be interesting to find out exactly how this method works!

"Evolution is the change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms through successive generations. After a population splits into smaller groups, these groups evolve independently and diversity into new species. A hierarchy of anatomical and genetic similarities, geographical distribution of similar species and the fossil record indicate that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor. Laetoli is a site of Tanzania famous for its hominid (human and its fossil ancestors) footprints, preserved in volcanic ash. (i) What is the main reason for evolution according to Darwin ? (ii) ‘Both Human beings and chimpanzee have a common ancestor’. Justify the statement by giving reason behind the conclusion.",(i) Natural selection and generation of new species. (ii) (a) Changes due to genetic drift and natural selection will result in isolation of two subpopulation which become more and more different from each other. 		(b) Characters of the fossils also stated the characteristics of ancestors.,"e have seen that reproductive processes give rise to new individuals that are similar, but subtly different. We have discussed how some amount of variation is produced even during asexual reproduction. And the number of successful variations are maximised by the process of sexual reproduction. If we observe a field of sugarcane we find very little variations among the individual plants. But in a number of animals including human beings, which reproduce sexually, quite distinct variations are visible among different individuals. In this chapter, we shall be studying the mechanism by which variations are created and inherited. The long-term consequences of the accumulation of variations are also an interesting point to be considered. We shall be studying this under evolution.

 Figure 9.1 Creation of diversity over succeeding generations. The original organism at the top will give rise to, say, two individuals, similar in body design, but with subtle differences. Each of them, in turn, will give rise to two individuals in the next generation. Each of the four individuals in the bottom row will be different from each other. While some of these differences will be unique, others will be inherited from their respective parents, who were different from each other.

Each of them, in turn, will give rise to two individuals in the next generation. Each of the four individuals in the bottom row will be different from each other. While some of these differences will be unique, others will be inherited from their respective parents, who were different from each other.
 Inheritance from the previous generation provides both a common basic body design, and subtle changes in it, for the next generation. Now think about what would happen when this new generation, in its turn, reproduces. The second generation will have differences that they inherit from the first generation, as well as newly created differences (Fig. 9.1). Figure 9.1 would represent the situation if a single individual reproduces, as happens in asexual reproduction. If one bacterium divides, and then the resultant two bacteria divide again, the four individual bacteria generated would be very similar. There would be only very minor differences between them, generated due to small inaccuracies in DNA copying. However, if sexual reproduction is involved, even greater diversity will be generated, as we will see when we discuss the rules of inheritance. Do all these variations in a species have equal chances of surviving in the environment in which they find themselves? Obviously not. Depending on the nature of variations, different individuals would have

What is the theory behind the precipitation reaction between aqueous solution of barium chloride with aqueous solution of sodium sulphate ?,"When a solution of sodium sulphate is mixed with a solution of barium chloride, the following double displacement reaction takes place : → BaSO4(s) + 2NaCl(aq) Na2SO4(aq) + BaCl2(aq)  In this reaction, sulphate ions from sodium sulphate are displaced by chloride ions (Cl–) and chloride ions in barium chloride are displaced by sulphate ions. As a result, a white precipitate of barium sulphate is formed and sodium chloride remains in the solution.","Take about 3 mL of sodium sulphate solution in a test tube. In another test tube, take about 3 mL of barium chloride solution. Mix the two solutions (Fig. 1.9). What do you observe?

"Temporary magnets and permanent magnets play an important role in our day to day life. A magnet has the ability to attract the magnetic elements.

Magnets are used in junk yard to make new cars and in roller-coasters too. (i) State the objectives for this observation. (ii) Estimate the values of electromagnets used by people around you.","(i) Objectives : To understand the need to have temporary and permanent magnets. To understand the need to use different materials for making magnets.

Even weak ion currents that travel along the nerve cells in our body produce magnetic fields. When we touch something, our nerves carry an electric impulse to the muscles we need to use. This impulse produces a temporary magnetic field. These fields are very weak and are about one-billionth of the earth’s magnetic field. Two main organs in the human body where the magnetic field produced is significant, are the heart and the brain. The magnetic field inside the body forms the basis of obtaining the images of different body parts. This is done using a technique called Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Analysis of these images helps in medical diagnosis. Magnetism has, thus, got important uses in medicine.

Suddenly the news spread in the school that the fire had broken out in examination room. All the important papers and office documents were burnt. The reason for this mishap was short circuiting. What is short circuiting and what precautions can be taken to avoid such tragic incidents ?,"Short-circuiting takes place if live wire and neutral wire come into direct contact due to damage of insulation of live wire. Use fuse, connecting wire should be of good quality, wire should be properly insulated externally. Associated Value : The learners will become more educated to handle emergency situation like electric fire more carefully.","Figure 13.20 gives a schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuits. In each separate circuit, different appliances can be connected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a separate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order that each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected parallel to each other. Electric fuse is an important component of all domestic circuits. We have already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous chapter (see Section 12.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the appliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur when the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This occurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the appliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly increases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse prevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage by stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating that takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit. Overloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply voltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many appliances to a single socket.
 In our houses we receive AC electric power of 220 V with a frequency of 50 Hz. One of the wires in this supply is with red insulation, called live wire. The other one is of black insulation, which is a neutral wire. The potential difference between the two is 220 V. The third is the earth wire that has green insulation and this is connected to a metallic body deep inside earth. It is used as a safety measure to ensure that any leakage of current to a metallic body does not give any severe shock to a user.

 Fuse is the most important safety device, used for protecting the circuits due to short-circuiting or overloading of the circuits.

For example, tube light and fan in all rooms two TV’s, computer, light of toilet & kitchen were switched on. Sohan told his friend that this is not the way to use electricity. Now the question arises whether this habit of consuming electrical energy is acceptable or not. Will it effect the economic condition of the family, as well as the nation how ?","No. Yes, it will affect the economic condition of family as well as the nation because both renewable and mostly non-renewable sources of energy is used to generate large amount of electricity. We should conserve the energy. Associated Value : The learners will be encouraged to adopt eco-friendly attitude which is also a need of the hour.","In ancient times, wood was the most common source of heat energy. The energy of flowing water and wind was also used for limited activities. Can you think of some of these uses? The exploitation of coal as a source of energy made the industrial revolution possible. Increasing industrialisation has led to a better quality of life all over the world. It has also caused the global demand for energy to grow at a tremendous rate. The growing demand for energy was largely met by the fossil fuels – coal and petroleum. Our technologies were also developed for using these energy sources. But these fuels were formed over millions of years ago and there are only limited reserves. The fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy, so we need to conserve them. If we were to continue consuming these sources at such alarming rates, we would soon run out of energy! In order to avoid this, alternate sources of energy were explored. But we continue to be largely dependent on fossil fuels for most of our energy requirements (Fig. 14.1). Burning fossil fuels has other disadvantages too. We learnt in Class IX about the air pollution caused by burning of coal or petroleum products. The oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur that are released on burning fossil fuels are acidic oxides. These lead to acid rain which affects our water and soil resources. In addition to the problem of air pollution, recall the green-house effect of gases like carbon dioxide.
 Think it over How would our lives change if we could no longer get electricity supply? The availability of electrical energy to each individual in a country is one of the parameters to measure the growth of the country. The pollution caused by burning fossil fuels can be somewhat reduced by increasing the efficiency of the combustion process and using various techniques to reduce the escape of harmful gases and ashes into the surroundings. Besides being used directly for various purposes – in gas stoves and vehicles, do you know fossil fuels are the major fuels used for generating electricity? Let us produce some electricity at our own small plant in the class and see what goes into producing our favourite form of energy.
 14.4 ENVIRONMENT AL CONSEQUENCES ENVIRONMENTAL We have studied various sources of energy in the previous sections. Exploiting any source of energy disturbs the environment in some way or the other. In any given situation, the source we would choose depends on factors such as the ease of extracting energy from that source, the economics of extracting energy from the source, the efficiency of the technology available and the environmental damage that will be caused by using that source. Though we talk of ‘clean’ fuels like CNG, it would be more exact to say that a particular source is cleaner than the other. We have already seen that burning fossil fuels causes air pollution. In some cases, the actual operation of a device like the solar cell may be pollution-free, but the assembly of the device would have caused some environmental damage. Research continues in these areas to produce longer lasting devices that will cause less damage throughout their life.

 Our resources like forests, wildlife, water, coal and petroleum need to be used in a sustainable manner. We can reduce pressure on the environment by sincerely applying the maxim of ‘Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose and Recycle’ in our lives. Management of forest resources has to take into account the interests of various stakeholders. The harnessing of water resources by building dams has social, economic and environmental implications. Alternatives to large dams exist. These are localespecific and may be developed so as to give local people control over their local resources.

There were plenty of livestocks and the household used cooking gas from the plant. Also their farm had rich vegetation. They contacted sarpanch of the village and convinced him to set up a biogas plant for village community. (i) Mention the values displayed by Mr. Nair, Nikhil and Neha. (ii) Explain the possible arguments given by Nikhil and Neha to the Sarpanch to convince him to set up community biogas plant. ","(i) Mr. Nair’s readiness to adopt improvised technology for efficient use of fuel. Nikhil and Neha had concern for the whole village community and wanted that all should be benefitted by this technology and the environment be pollution free. (ii) Nikhil and Neha explained to them that by setting up community biogas plant, the plant and animal waste would be disposed of in better manner. They would get manure and better fuel too. ","14.2.4 Improvements in the Technology for using Conventional Sources of Energy Bio-Mass We mentioned earlier that wood has been used as a fuel for a long time. If we can ensure that enough trees are planted, a continuous supply of fire-wood can be assured. You must also be familiar with the use of cow-dung cakes as a fuel. Given the large live-stock population in India, this can also assure us a steady source of fuel. Since these fuels are plant and animal products, the source of these fuels is said to be bio-mass. These fuels, however, do not produce much heat on burning and a lot of smoke is given out when they are burnt. Therefore, technological inputs to improve the efficiency of these fuels are necessary. When wood is burnt in a limited supply of oxygen, water and volatile materials present in it get removed and charcoal is left behind as the residue. Charcoal burns without flames, is comparatively smokeless and has a higher heat generation efficiency. Similarly, cow-dung, various plant materials like the residue after harvesting the crops, vegetable waste and sewage are decomposed in the absence of oxygen to give bio-gas. Since the starting material is mainly cow-dung, it is popularly known as ‘gobar-gas’. Bio-gas is produced in a plant as shown in Fig. 14.4.

"Traffic jams, outside the school gate was a common sight since most of the students came on their own cars. This became a topic for discussion on every P.T.A meeting. On one such P.T.A. meeting, the principal pointed out the examples of four of their teachers who were car pooling for the past several years. She asked the parents also to adopt this method to sort out the problem. (a) List two values shown by the teachers mentioned by the Principal. (b) Explain two advantages that will occur if more parents emulated the example of these teachers.  3","(a) (i) They share a common concern for the need to conserve fossil fuels which are nonrenewable. (ii) They value cooperation and co-ordination for a common cause of energy conservation. (b) If parents would adopt car pooling then the number of cars on street would reduce. This would save a lot of petrol or diesel which is a fossil fuel. Apart from saving money, there would be less pollution in air because burning fossil fuel causes air pollution.  3","Our resources like forests, wildlife, water, coal and petroleum need to be used in a sustainable manner. We can reduce pressure on the environment by sincerely applying the maxim of ‘Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose and Recycle’ in our lives. Management of forest resources has to take into account the interests of various stakeholders. The harnessing of water resources by building dams has social, economic and environmental implications. Alternatives to large dams exist. These are localespecific and may be developed so as to give local people control over their local resources. The fossil fuels, coal and petroleum, will ultimately be exhausted. Because of this and because their combustion pollutes our environment, we need to use these resources judiciously.

We saw in this chapter that there are four main stakeholders when it comes to forests and wildlife. Which among these should have the authority to decide the management of forest produce? Why do you think so? 4. How can you as an individual contribute or make a difference to the management of (a) forests and wildlife, (b) water resources and (c) coal and petroleum? 5. What can you as an individual do to reduce your consumption of the various natural resources? 6. List five things you have done over the last one week to — (a) conserve our natural resources. (b) increase the pressure on our natural resources. 7. On the basis of the issues raised in this chapter, what changes would you incorporate in your lifestyle in a move towards a sustainable use of our resources?
 In ancient times, wood was the most common source of heat energy. The energy of flowing water and wind was also used for limited activities. Can you think of some of these uses? The exploitation of coal as a source of energy made the industrial revolution possible. Increasing industrialisation has led to a better quality of life all over the world. It has also caused the global demand for energy to grow at a tremendous rate. The growing demand for energy was largely met by the fossil fuels – coal and petroleum. Our technologies were also developed for using these energy sources. But these fuels were formed over millions of years ago and there are only limited reserves. The fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy, so we need to conserve them. If we were to continue consuming these sources at such alarming rates, we would soon run out of energy! In order to avoid this, alternate sources of energy were explored. But we continue to be largely dependent on fossil fuels for most of our energy requirements (Fig. 14.1). Burning fossil fuels has other disadvantages too. We learnt in Class IX about the air pollution caused by burning of coal or petroleum products. The oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur that are released on burning fossil fuels are acidic oxides. These lead to acid rain which affects our water and soil resources. In addition to the problem of air pollution, recall the green-house effect of gases like carbon dioxide.
 Think it over How would our lives change if we could no longer get electricity supply? The availability of electrical energy to each individual in a country is one of the parameters to measure the growth of the country. The pollution caused by burning fossil fuels can be somewhat reduced by increasing the efficiency of the combustion process and using various techniques to reduce the escape of harmful gases and ashes into the surroundings. Besides being used directly for various purposes – in gas stoves and vehicles, do you know fossil fuels are the major fuels used for generating electricity? Let us produce some electricity at our own small plant in the class and see what goes into producing our favourite form of energy.

Preeti in her summer vacations went to a village with her mother. She saw that many women in the village were busy preparing cakes from cowdung. She also saw that they were using these cowdung cakes as a fuel in Chulhas for cooking food. Preeti was surprised to see this and asked her mother about the cakes. (i) Name other source of fuel which is prepared from cowdung. (ii) Name the gases which are present in this fuel. (iii) What values did this fuel indicate ?,"(i) Biogas. (ii) Methane, Carbon dioxide. (iii) Values : (a) It has high calorific value. (b) It burns without smoke. (c) It does not leave any residue.","Consider the various options we have when we choose a fuel for cooking our food. What are the criteria you would consider when trying to categorise something as a good fuel? Would your choice be different if you lived (a) in a forest? (b) in a remote mountain village or small island? (c) in New Delhi? (d) lived five centuries ago? How are the factors different in each case?
 After going through the two activities above, we can see that the particular source of energy, or fuel, we select for performing some work depends on many different factors. For example, while selecting a fuel, we would ask ourselves the following questions. (i) How much heat does it release on burning? (ii) Does it produce a lot of smoke? (iii) Is it easily available? Can you think of three more relevant questions to ask about a fuel? Given the range of fuels we have today, what are the factors which would limit our choices when it comes to a particular task like cooking our food? Would the fuel selected also depend on the work to be done? For example, would we choose one fuel for cooking and another for heating the room in winter? We could then say that a good source of energy would be one n which would do a large amount of work per unit volume or mass, n be easily accessible, n be easy to store and transport, and n perhaps most importantly, be economical.

Hydro power plants convert the potential energy of falling water into electricity. Since there are very few water-falls which could be used as a source of potential energy, hydro power plants are associated with dams. In the last century, a large number of dams were built all over the world. As we can see from Fig. 14.1, a quarter of our energy requirement in India is met by hydro power plants.

 Do You Know?
 How is nuclear energy generated? In a process called nuclear fission, the nucleus of a heavy atom (such as uranium, plutonium or thorium), when bombarded with low-energy neutrons, can be split apart into lighter nuclei. When this is done, a tremendous amount of energy is released if the mass of the original nucleus is just a little more than the sum of the masses of the individual products. The fission of an atom of uranium, for example, produces 10 million times the energy produced by the combustion of an atom of carbon from coal. In a nuclear reactor designed for electric power generation, such nuclear ‘fuel’ can be part of a selfsustaining fission chain reaction that releases energy at a controlled rate. The released energy can be used to produce steam and further generate electricity.
 The major hazard of nuclear power generation is the storage and disposal of spent or used fuels – the uranium still decaying into harmful subatomic particles (radiations). Improper nuclear-waste storage and disposal result in environmental contamination. Further, there is a risk of accidental leakage of nuclear radiation. The high cost of installation of a nuclear power plant, high risk of environmental contamination and limited availability of uranium makes large-scale use of nuclear energy prohibitive. Nuclear energy was first used for destructive purposes before nuclear power stations were designed. The fundamental physics of the fission chain reaction in a nuclear weapon is similar to the physics of a controlled nuclear reactor, but the two types of device are engineered quite differently.
 Nuclear fusion Currently all commercial nuclear reactors are based on nuclear fission. But there is another possibility of nuclear energy generation by a safer process called nuclear fusion. Fusion means joining lighter nuclei to make a heavier nucleus, most commonly hydrogen or hydrogen isotopes to create helium, such as 2 H + 2H → 3He (+ n) It releases a tremendous amount of energy, according to the Einstein equation, as the mass of the product is little less than the sum of the masses of the original individual nuclei. Such nuclear fusion reactions are the source of energy in the Sun and other stars. It takes considerable energy to force the nuclei to fuse. The conditions needed for this process are extreme – millions of degrees of temperature and millions of pascals of pressure. The hydrogen bomb is based on thermonuclear fusion reaction. A nuclear bomb based on the fission of uranium or plutonium is placed at the core of the hydrogen bomb. This nuclear bomb is embedded in a substance which contains deuterium and lithium. When the nuclear bomb (based on fission) is detonated, the temperature of this substance is raised to 107 K in a few microseconds. The high temperature generates sufficient energy for the light nuclei to fuse and a devastating amount of energy is released.

 14.4 ENVIRONMENT AL CONSEQUENCES ENVIRONMENTAL We have studied various sources of energy in the previous sections. Exploiting any source of energy disturbs the environment in some way or the other. In any given situation, the source we would choose depends on factors such as the ease of extracting energy from that source, the economics of extracting energy from the source, the efficiency of the technology available and the environmental damage that will be caused by using that source. Though we talk of ‘clean’ fuels like CNG, it would be more exact to say that a particular source is cleaner than the other. We have already seen that burning fossil fuels causes air pollution. In some cases, the actual operation of a device like the solar cell may be pollution-free, but the assembly of the device would have caused some environmental damage. Research continues in these areas to produce longer lasting devices that will cause less damage throughout their life.

Another advantage is that they can be set up in remote and inaccessible hamlets or very sparsely inhabited areas in which laying of a power transmission line may be expensive and not commercially viable. Silicon, which is used for making solar cells, is abundant in nature but availability of the special grade silicon for making solar cells is limited.

(i) How can Ranbir obtain charcoal from wood ? (ii) Why is charcoal considered as better fuel than wood ? Give two reasons. (iii) State the values that prompted this action of Ranbir. ,"(i) Charcoal can be produced by cutting trees, 1 kg of wood on destructive distillation produces only 0.25 kg of charcoal. (ii) (a) Charcoal has high calorific value. (b) Charcoal does not produce any smoke. (iii) No regard for environment, disregard for health.","In ancient times, wood was the most common source of heat energy. The energy of flowing water and wind was also used for limited activities. Can you think of some of these uses? The exploitation of coal as a source of energy made the industrial revolution possible. Increasing industrialisation has led to a better quality of life all over the world. It has also caused the global demand for energy to grow at a tremendous rate. The growing demand for energy was largely met by the fossil fuels – coal and petroleum. Our technologies were also developed for using these energy sources. But these fuels were formed over millions of years ago and there are only limited reserves. The fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy, so we need to conserve them. If we were to continue consuming these sources at such alarming rates, we would soon run out of energy! In order to avoid this, alternate sources of energy were explored. But we continue to be largely dependent on fossil fuels for most of our energy requirements (Fig. 14.1). Burning fossil fuels has other disadvantages too. We learnt in Class IX about the air pollution caused by burning of coal or petroleum products. The oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur that are released on burning fossil fuels are acidic oxides. These lead to acid rain which affects our water and soil resources. In addition to the problem of air pollution, recall the green-house effect of gases like carbon dioxide.
 Think it over How would our lives change if we could no longer get electricity supply? The availability of electrical energy to each individual in a country is one of the parameters to measure the growth of the country. The pollution caused by burning fossil fuels can be somewhat reduced by increasing the efficiency of the combustion process and using various techniques to reduce the escape of harmful gases and ashes into the surroundings. Besides being used directly for various purposes – in gas stoves and vehicles, do you know fossil fuels are the major fuels used for generating electricity? Let us produce some electricity at our own small plant in the class and see what goes into producing our favourite form of energy.

"A school organized a study tour for its students to observe how do people in village use energy resources for their living. They observed that in one of the villages, people use wood and cow dung as a fuel while in the nearby village they saw modern technology was used by the villagers for better sanitation and management of their biowaste and sewage materials by establishing biogas plant.

(c) State the associated values which you would get from this excursion tour.",(a) Second villagers because they utilises the biowaste for established biogas plant. (b) Biogas is cheap and does not cause pollution. (c) Knowledge and Awareness.,"14.2.4 Improvements in the Technology for using Conventional Sources of Energy Bio-Mass We mentioned earlier that wood has been used as a fuel for a long time. If we can ensure that enough trees are planted, a continuous supply of fire-wood can be assured. You must also be familiar with the use of cow-dung cakes as a fuel. Given the large live-stock population in India, this can also assure us a steady source of fuel. Since these fuels are plant and animal products, the source of these fuels is said to be bio-mass. These fuels, however, do not produce much heat on burning and a lot of smoke is given out when they are burnt. Therefore, technological inputs to improve the efficiency of these fuels are necessary. When wood is burnt in a limited supply of oxygen, water and volatile materials present in it get removed and charcoal is left behind as the residue. Charcoal burns without flames, is comparatively smokeless and has a higher heat generation efficiency. Similarly, cow-dung, various plant materials like the residue after harvesting the crops, vegetable waste and sewage are decomposed in the absence of oxygen to give bio-gas. Since the starting material is mainly cow-dung, it is popularly known as ‘gobar-gas’. Bio-gas is produced in a plant as shown in Fig. 14.4.

[Board Term-I Set (45), 2012]","The correct method is opted by Raghav i.e., mixing of conc. H2SO4 to water slowly with constant stirring. The reaction is highly exothermic and heat generated is evenly distributed in the water. In the other method opted by Raman, the heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and causes burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. ","Take 10 mL water in a beaker. Add a few drops of concentrated H2SO4 to it and swirl the beaker slowly. Touch the base of the beaker. Is there a change in temperature? Is this an exothermic or endothermic process? Repeat the above Activity with sodium hydroxide pellets and record your observations.
 The process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly exothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric acid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly to water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid, the heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look out for the warning sign (shown in Fig. 2.5) on the can of concentrated sulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets. Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the concentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is called dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.
 Mixing concentrated acids or bases with water is a highly exothermic process.

As these chemicals are not degradable, these get accumulated progressively at each trophic level. As human beings occupy the top level in any food chain, the maximum concentration of these chemicals get accumulated in our bodies. This phenomenon is known as biological magnification. This is the reason why our food grains such as wheat and rice, vegetables and fruits, and even meat, contain varying amounts of pesticide residues. They cannot always be removed by washing or other means.

Brushing our teeth twice a day is a well-known saying.

The best way to prevent this is to clean the teeth using toothpaste which are generally basic. These can neutralize the excess acid and prevent tooth decay. Associated Value : The learner will be motivated to keep her teeth properly cleaned.,"have often heard adults complaining about ‘acidity’. Can this be related to what has been discussed above? The exit of food from the stomach is regulated by a sphincter muscle which releases it in small amounts into the small intestine. From the stomach, the food now enters the small intestine. This is the longest part of the alimentary canal which is fitted into a compact space because of extensive coiling. The length of the small intestine differs in various animals depending on the food they eat. Herbivores eating grass need a longer small intestine to allow the cellulose to be digested. Meat is easier to digest, hence carnivores like tigers have a shorter small intestine. The small intestine is the site of the complete digestion of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. It receives the secretions of the liver and pancreas for this purpose. The food coming from the stomach is acidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act. Bile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats. Fats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes it difficult for enzymes to act on them. Bile salts break them down into smaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action. This is similar to the emulsifying action of soaps on dirt that we have learnt about in Chapter 4. The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which contains enzymes like trypsin for digesting proteins and lipase for breaking down emulsified fats. The walls of the small intestine contain glands which secrete intestinal juice. The enzymes present in it finally convert the proteins to amino acids, complex carbohydrates into glucose and fats into fatty acids and glycerol. Digested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner lining of the small intestine has numerous finger-like projections called villi which increase the surface area for absorption. The villi are richly supplied with blood vessels which take the absorbed food to each and every cell of the body, where it is utilised for obtaining energy, building up new tissues and the repair of old tissues. The unabsorbed food is sent into the large intestine where its wall absorb more water from this material. The rest of the material is removed from the body via the anus. The exit of this waste material is regulated by the anal sphincter.
 Dental caries Dental caries or tooth decay causes gradual softening of enamel and dentine. It begins when bacteria acting on sugars produce acids that softens or demineralises the enamel. Masses of bacterial cells together with food particles stick to the teeth to form dental plaque. Saliva cannot reach the tooth surface to neutralise the acid as plaque covers the teeth. Brushing the teeth after eating removes the plaque before the bacteria produce acids. If untreated, microorganisms may invade the pulp, causing inflammation and infection.

"Nature of image formed by mirrors depends on the nature of the mirror and the position of the object in some cases. In a single array, one can make mirrors of various nature. A universal mirror, an object that reflects all light waves back at their source, has been created by scientists in Europe and Asia. Unlike an ordinary mirror, which reflects object at 90 degrees, a universal mirror reflects object back at any angle. A mirror may be flat or curved.

(b) Convex mirror are used as rear-view mirrors in vehicles. (c) Plane mirrors are used to see our virtual image.","The curved surface of a shining spoon could be considered as a curved mirror. The most commonly used type of curved mirror is the spherical mirror. The reflecting surface of such mirrors can be considered to form a part of the surface of a sphere. Such mirrors, whose reflecting surfaces are spherical, are called spherical mirrors. We shall now study about spherical mirrors in some detail.
 AL MIRRORS 10.2 SPHERIC SPHERICAL The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or outwards. A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards, that is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror. A spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called a convex mirror. The schematic representation of these mirrors is shown in Fig. 10.1. You may note in these diagrams that the back of the mirror is shaded. You may now understand that the surface of the spoon curved inwards can be approximated to a concave mirror and the surface of the spoon bulged outwards can be approximated to a convex mirror. Before we move further on spherical mirrors, we need to recognise and understand the meaning of a few terms. These (a) Concave mirror (b) Convex mirror terms are commonly used in discussions about spherical mirrors. The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical Figure 10.1 mirror is a point called the pole.

 Figure 9.6 Sex determination in human beings
 Figure 9.6 Sex determination in human beings
 We have discussed the idea that the two sexes participating in sexual reproduction must be somewhat different from each other for a number of reasons. How is the sex of a newborn individual determined? Different species use very different strategies for this. Some rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus, in some animals like a few reptiles, the temperature at which fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the animals developing in the eggs will be male or female. In other animals, such as snails, individuals can change sex, indicating that sex is not genetically determined. However, in human beings, the sex of the individual is largely genetically determined. In other words, the genes inherited from our parents decide whether we will be boys or girls. But so far, we have assumed that similar gene sets are inherited from both parents. If that is the case, how can genetic inheritance determine sex? The explanation lies in the fact that all human chromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes have a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22 such pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is odd in not always being a perfect pair. Women have a perfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men have a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X while the other is a short one called Y. So women are XX, while men are XY. Now, can we work out what the inheritance pattern of X and Y will be? As Fig. 9.6 shows, half the children will be boys and half will be girls. All children will inherit an X chromosome from their mother regardless of whether they are boys or girls. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by what they inherit from their father. A child who inherits an X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one who inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy.
 How is the sex of the child determined in human beings?

"Reproductive health covers in all those aspects of general health which help a person to lead a normal, safe and satisfying reproductive life. But the overall burden of reproductive ill health is very high and many women die every year due to the complications of pregnancy and child birth. Most maternal deaths occur due to haemorrhage, septic, obstructed labour and unsafe abortions. Male participation in the family welfare programme is very poor and acceptance of vasectomy is particularly low. Research related to reproductive health encompasses safe motherhood, prevention and management of complication of abortions, reproductive tract infection and sexually transmitted diseases. (i) What is STD ? Name two STDs which can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy. (ii) Reproductive health is of prior importance to reduce maternal mortality. Suggest some measures which can save mother from unnecessary pregnancy and from STDs.","(i) STDs are sexually transmitted diseases. Two STDs are — AIDS, Gonorrhea. (ii) Some measures to prevent pregnancy : (a) Use of intrauterine contraceptive devices. (b) Use of oral pills. (c) Use of cervical caps. (d) Surgical method Tubectomy (e) Use of vaginal pills. (f) Use of condoms.","We must also consider the possible health consequences of having sex. We have discussed in Class IX that diseases can be transmitted from person to person in a variety of ways. Since the sexual act is a very intimate connection of bodies, it is not surprising that many diseases can be sexually transmitted. These include bacterial infections such as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as warts and HIV-AIDS. Is it possible to prevent the transmission of such diseases during the sexual act? Using a covering, called a condom, for the penis during sex helps to prevent transmission of many of these infections to some extent. The sexual act always has the potential to lead to pregnancy. Pregnancy will make major demands on the body and the mind of the woman, and if she is not ready for it, her health will be adversely affected. Therefore, many ways have been devised to avoid pregnancy. These contraceptive methods fall in a number of categories. One category is the creation of a mechanical barrier so that sperm does not reach the egg. Condoms on the penis or similar coverings worn in the vagina can serve this purpose. Another category of contraceptives acts by changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not released and fertilisation cannot occur. These drugs commonly need to be taken orally as pills. However, since they change hormonal balances, they can cause side-effects too. Other contraceptive devices such as the loop or the copper-T are placed in the uterus to prevent pregnancy. Again, they can cause side effects due to irritation of the uterus. If the vas deferens in the male is blocked, sperm transfer will be prevented. If the fallopian tube in the female is blocked, the egg will not be able to reach the uterus. In both cases fertilisation will not take place. Surgical methods can be used to create such blocks. While surgical methods are safe in the long run, surgery itself can cause infections and other problems if not performed properly. Surgery can also be used for removal of unwanted pregnancies. These may be misused by people who do not want a particular child, as happens in illegal sex-selective abortion of female foetuses. For a healthy society, the female-male sex ratio must be maintained. Because of reckless female foeticides, child sex ratio is declining at an alarming rate in some sections of our society, although prenatal sex determination has been prohibited by law. We have noted earlier that reproduction is the process by which organisms increase their populations. The rates of birth and death in a given population will determine its size. The size of the human population is a cause for concern for many people. This is because an expanding population makes it harder to improve everybody’s standard of living. However, if inequality in society is the main reason for poor standards of living for many people, the size of the population is relatively unimportant. If we look around us, what can we identify as the most important reason(s) for poor living standards? 139

"From the time of conception, the girl child was discriminated against all her life because daughters are perceived as an economic and social burden and also of the obsession for a male child in our patriarchal society. Sunita got married in a very rich family and was living a very happy life. Soon she became pregnant and gave the news to all her family members. To her surprise, her husband and in-law, forced her for the prenatal sex determination of the sex of the foetus and got her aborted when they found that it was a girl child. (a) Do you think it was correct to go for the prenatal sex determination ? According to you is there any difference in between the female and the male child ? (b) Why do you think that Sunita should not be blamed for giving birth to a girl child ? ","(a) No, it was incorrect. No, there is no difference between a girl and a boy. The sex determination is a matter of chance. (b) It is the father, who is responsible for the male or female child.

 We have discussed the idea that the two sexes participating in sexual reproduction must be somewhat different from each other for a number of reasons. How is the sex of a newborn individual determined? Different species use very different strategies for this. Some rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus, in some animals like a few reptiles, the temperature at which fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the animals developing in the eggs will be male or female. In other animals, such as snails, individuals can change sex, indicating that sex is not genetically determined. However, in human beings, the sex of the individual is largely genetically determined. In other words, the genes inherited from our parents decide whether we will be boys or girls. But so far, we have assumed that similar gene sets are inherited from both parents. If that is the case, how can genetic inheritance determine sex? The explanation lies in the fact that all human chromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes have a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22 such pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is odd in not always being a perfect pair. Women have a perfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men have a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X while the other is a short one called Y. So women are XX, while men are XY. Now, can we work out what the inheritance pattern of X and Y will be? As Fig. 9.6 shows, half the children will be boys and half will be girls. All children will inherit an X chromosome from their mother regardless of whether they are boys or girls. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by what they inherit from their father. A child who inherits an X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one who inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy.

"Sexual reproduction is a type of reproduction in which the two sexes, namely, male and female are involved. The male sexual unit is known as male gamete or sperm in humans while female sexual unit is termed as female gamete or ova. Thus, the two major processes, i.e., formation of gametes and fusion of gametes constitute sexual reproduction. (i) What is fertilisation ? (ii) “Sexual reproduction is considered to be superior to a sexual reproduction in terms of variation in species.” Comment any four points in respect of this statement.",(i) Fusion of a male gamete with a female gamete is known as fertilisation. (ii) (a) It promotes diversity of characters in the offsprings. 		(b) It results in new combination of genes brought together in gamete. 		(c) It increases genetic variation. 		(d) It plays a prominent role in the origin of new species.,"Reproduction, unlike other life processes, is not essential to maintain the life of an individual organism. Reproduction involves creation of a DNA copy and additional cellular apparatus by the cell involved in the process. Various organisms use different modes of reproduction depending on their body design. In fission, many bacteria and protozoa simply divide into two or more daughter cells. Organisms such as hydra can regenerate if they are broken into pieces. They can also give out buds which mature into new individuals. Roots, stems and leaves of some plants develop into new plants through vegetative propagation. These are examples of asexual reproduction where new generations are created from a single individual. Sexual reproduction involves two individuals for the creation of a new individual. DNA copying mechanisms creates variations which are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. Modes of sexual reproduction allow for greater variation to be generated. Reproduction in flowering plants involves transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma which is referred to as pollination. This is followed by fertilisation. Changes in the body at puberty, such as increase in breast size in girls and new facial hair growth in boys, are signs of sexual maturation. The male reproductive system in human beings consists of testes which produce sperms, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, urethra and penis. The female reproductive system in human beings consists of ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus and vagina. Sexual reproduction in human beings involves the introduction of sperm in the vagina of the female. Fertilisation occurs in the fallopian tube. Contraception to avoid pregnancy can be achieved by the use of condoms, oral pills, copper-T and other methods.

"Food chain is a sequence of organisms through which energy is transferred in the form of food by the process of one organism consuming the other.

This makes our environment clean. (ii) Consumers are the organisms which depend on others for their survival, or food. Consumers are herbivores, carnivores or omnivores. Man is omnivore which depend on others for its food either plants or flesh.","We have seen in earlier classes that organisms can be grouped as producers, consumers and decomposers according to the manner in which they obtain their sustenance from the environment. Let us recall what we have learnt through the self sustaining ecosystem created by us above. Which organisms can make organic compounds like sugar and starch from inorganic substances using the radiant energy of the Sun in the presence of chlorophyll? All green plants and certain bacteria which can produce food by photosynthesis come under this category and are called the producers. Organisms depend on the producers either directly or indirectly for their sustenance? These organisms which consume the food produced, either directly from producers or indirectly by feeding on other consumers are the consumers. Consumers can be classed variously as herbivores, carnivores, omnivores and parasites. Can you give examples for each of these categories of consumers? n Imagine the situation where you do not clean the aquarium and some fish and plants have died. Have you ever thought what happens when an organism dies? The microorganisms, comprising bacteria and fungi, break-down the dead remains and waste products of organisms. These microorganisms are the decomposers as they break-down the complex organic substances into simple inorganic substances that go into the soil and are used up once more by the plants. What will happen to the garbage, and dead animals and plants in their absence? Will the natural replenishment of the soil take place, even if decomposers are not there?

"The ozone layer is a layer of the earth’s atmosphere in which most of the atmosphere’s ozone is concentrated. It protects the earth from harmful radiation like high energy U-V radiations from passing through it. Protective role of the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere is so vital that scientists believe life on earth probably would not have evolved and could not exist today without it. In 1970’s, scientist discovered that chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) can reach the stratosphere and destroy the ozone gas. In 1985, scientist discovered that every year, the ozone layer over Antarctica becomes drastically thinner during southern hemisphere spring, which forms a ‘Ozone hole’ over Antarctica.

Ozone at the higher levels of the atmosphere is a product of UV radiation acting on oxygen (O2) molecule. The higher energy UV radiations split apart some moleculer oxygen (O2) into free oxygen (O) atoms. These atoms then combine with the molecular oxygen to form ozone as shown— UV O2  →O+O
 O + O2 → O3 ( Ozone)
 The amount of ozone in the atmosphere began to drop sharply in the 1980s. This decrease has been linked to synthetic chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used as refrigerants and in fire extinguishers. In 1987, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) succeeded in forging an agreement to freeze CFC production at 1986 levels. It is now mandatory for all the manufacturing companies to make CFC-free refrigerators throughout the world.
 The use of chemicals like CFCs has endangered the ozone layer. Since the ozone layer protects against the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, this could damage the environment.

However, its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where the size of the particles is relatively larger.
 11.6.1 Tyndall Effect The earth’s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles. These particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles of dust and molecules of air. When a beam of light strikes such fine particles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us, after being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of scattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect which you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a fine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole. Thus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can also be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense forest. Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light. The colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering particles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of larger size scatter light of longer wavelengths. If the size of the scattering particles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear white.

"Four friends went to a picnic. The weather was pleasant. They played various games and then had snacks. Suddenly, Shyam one of them noticed seven colours in the sky. He said to others, “Wow what a rainbow“? The Ram, one of them, asked him “What is Rainbow“? He then explained to all about its formation. After that everyone in the group thanked him for the knowledge, he had given to them. (i) If you were in the place of Shyam, how you would have explained such a natural phenomenon. (ii) Which device can be used to obtain such a phenomenon. (iii) If Shyam was facing the rainbow, the where was the sun ? (iv) What is the moral value which is shown by Shyam?","(i) Rainbow is formed by the dispersion of Sunlight by the tiny water droplets present in the atmosphere after the rainfall. These water droplets act like a prism. Rays of Sunlight enter the water droplets. At the points of incidence, they refract and disperse, then gets reflected internally and finally gets refracted again at the point of emergence. Thus, the different colours of this spectrum called rainbow reach the observer’s eye. (ii) Prism. (iii) The Sun was behind Shyam. (iv) Knowledge increases by sharing, friendship, love and affection with nature.","11.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL ASS PRISM GLASS You must have seen and appreciated the spectacular colours in a rainbow. How could the white light of the Sun give us various colours of the rainbow? Before we take up this question, we shall first go back to the refraction of light through a prism. The inclined refracting surfaces of a glass prism show exciting phenomenon. Let us find it out through an activity.
 Activity 11.2 n n n n n
 Take a thick sheet of cardboard and make a small hole or narrow slit in its middle. Allow sunlight to fall on the narrow slit. This gives a narrow beam of white light. Now, take a glass prism and allow the light from the slit to fall on one of its faces as shown in Fig. 11.5. Turn the prism slowly until the light that comes out of it appears on a nearby screen. What do you observe? You will find a beautiful band of colours. Why does this happen?

 allowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through the second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging from the other side of the second prism. This observation gave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven colours. Any light that gives a spectrum similar to that of sunlight is often referred to as white light. A rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky after a rain shower (Fig. 11.7). It is caused by dispersion of sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the atmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a direction opposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets act like small prisms. They refract and disperse the incident sunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it again when it comes out of the raindrop (Fig. 11.8). Due to the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different colours reach the observer’s eye. You can also see a rainbow on a sunny day when you look at the sky through a waterfall or through a water fountain, with the Sun behind you.

"In a beautiful valley, there was a village. Trains passes from the village, the whistle and the sound of train mixed with the sound of waterfall seemed to be very pleasant to everyone. Children of that village loved to play near the railway track. One very light foggy day, a group children found that a fish plate was missing from the track. Knowing this, all of the villagers became tensed. Aditya, one of the children suddenly put his ear to the line and tried to know whether a train is coming or not and he knew that a train is coming. He asked his friends to inform the railway cabin crew and he himself put off his red shirt and starting running towards the train, waving his red shirt. Timely, the driver and cabin man got the information and a major accident hadn’t taken place. (a) Name the two physical phenomenon of science used by Aditya. (b) Why did Aditya use a red shirt instead of the other colours ? (c) What moral values were shown by Aditya ?",(a) (i) Sound travel through a medium. 		(ii) Scattering of light. (b) The red is least scattered by fog or smoke so it can be seen from a large distance. (c) (i) Proper knowledge and its application 		(ii) Concern for each other 		(iii) Friendship 		(iv) Health Concern,"11.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue? The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size smaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in scattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer wavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8 times greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter wavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters our eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been any scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark. The sky appears dark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not prominent at such heights. You might have observed that ‘danger’ signal lights are red in colour. Do you know why? The red is least scattered by fog or smoke. Therefore, it can be seen in the same colour at a distance.

(iii) By creating awareness among public for conservation of forest and wildlife to achieve sustainable development.,"16.2.2 Management of forest We need to consider if the goals of all the above stakeholders with regard to the management of the forests are the same. Forest resources are often made available for industrial use at rates far below the market value while these are denied to the local people. The Chipko Andolan (‘Hug the Trees Movement’) was the result of a grassroot level effort to end the alienation of people from their forests. The movement originated from an incident in a remote village called Reni in Garhwal, high-up in the Himalayas during the early 1970s. There was a dispute between the local villagers and a logging contractor who had been allowed to fell trees in a forest close to the village. On a particular day, the contractor’s workers appeared in the forest to cut the trees while the men folk were absent. Undeterred, the women of the village reached the forest quickly and clasped the tree trunks thus preventing the workers from felling the trees. Thus thwarted, the contractor had to withdraw. Inherent in such a competition to control a natural resource is the conservation of a replenishable resource. Specifically the method of use was being called into question. The contractor would have felled the trees, destroying them forever. The communities traditionally lop the branches and pluck the leaves, allowing the resource to replenish over time. The Chipko movement quickly spread across communities and media, and forced the government, to whom the forest belongs, to rethink their priorities in the use of forest produce. Experience has taught people that the destruction of forests affected not just the availability of forest products, but also the quality of soil and the sources of water. Participation of the local people can indeed lead to the efficient management of forests. An Example of People’s Participation in the Management of Forests In 1972, the West Bengal Forest Department recognised its failures in reviving the degraded Sal forests in the south-western districts of the state. Traditional methods of surveillance and policing had led to a ‘complete alienation of the people from the administration’, resulting in frequent clashes between forest officials and villagers. Forest and land related conflicts in the region were also a major factor in fuelling the militant peasant movements led by the Naxalites. Accordingly, the Department changed its strategy, making a beginning in the Arabari forest range of Midnapore district. Here, at the insistence of a far-seeing forest officer, A.K. Banerjee, villagers were involved in the protection of 1,272 hectares of badly degraded sal forest. In return for help in protection, villagers were given employment in both silviculture and harvesting operations, 25 per cent of the final harvest, and allowed fuelwood and fodder collection on payment of a nominal fee. With the active and willing participation of the local community, the

This management should also ensure equitable distribution of resources so that all, and not just a handful of rich and powerful people, benefit from the development of these resources. Another factor to be considered while we exploit these natural resources is the damage we cause to the environment while these resources are either extracted or used. For example, mining causes pollution because of the large amount of slag which is discarded for every tonne of metal extracted. Hence, sustainable natural resource management demands that we plan for the safe disposal of these wastes too. The present day global concerns for sustainable development and conservation of natural resources are of recent origin as compared to the long tradition and culture of nature conservation in our country. Principles of conservation and sustainable management were well established in the pre-historic India. Our ancient literature is full of such examples where values and sensitivity of humans towards nature was glorified and the principle of sustainability was established at its best.

 In ancient times, wood was the most common source of heat energy. The energy of flowing water and wind was also used for limited activities. Can you think of some of these uses? The exploitation of coal as a source of energy made the industrial revolution possible. Increasing industrialisation has led to a better quality of life all over the world. It has also caused the global demand for energy to grow at a tremendous rate. The growing demand for energy was largely met by the fossil fuels – coal and petroleum. Our technologies were also developed for using these energy sources. But these fuels were formed over millions of years ago and there are only limited reserves. The fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy, so we need to conserve them. If we were to continue consuming these sources at such alarming rates, we would soon run out of energy! In order to avoid this, alternate sources of energy were explored. But we continue to be largely dependent on fossil fuels for most of our energy requirements (Fig. 14.1). Burning fossil fuels has other disadvantages too. We learnt in Class IX about the air pollution caused by burning of coal or petroleum products. The oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur that are released on burning fossil fuels are acidic oxides. These lead to acid rain which affects our water and soil resources. In addition to the problem of air pollution, recall the green-house effect of gases like carbon dioxide.
 Think it over How would our lives change if we could no longer get electricity supply? The availability of electrical energy to each individual in a country is one of the parameters to measure the growth of the country. The pollution caused by burning fossil fuels can be somewhat reduced by increasing the efficiency of the combustion process and using various techniques to reduce the escape of harmful gases and ashes into the surroundings. Besides being used directly for various purposes – in gas stoves and vehicles, do you know fossil fuels are the major fuels used for generating electricity? Let us produce some electricity at our own small plant in the class and see what goes into producing our favourite form of energy.

But in early teenage years, a whole new set of changes occurs that cannot be explained simply as body enlargement. Instead, the appearance of the body changes. Proportions change, new features appear, and so do new sensations. Some of these changes are common to both boys and girls. We begin to notice thick hair growing in new parts of the body such as armpits and the genital area between the thighs, which can also become darker in colour. Thinner hair can also appear on legs and arms, as well as on the face. The skin frequently becomes oily and we might begin to develop pimples. We begin to be conscious and aware of both our own bodies and those of others in new ways. On the other hand, there are also changes taking place that are different between boys and girls. In girls, breast size begins to increase, with darkening of the skin of the nipples at the tips of the breasts. Also, girls begin to menstruate at around this time. Boys begin to have new thick hair growth on the face and their voices begin to crack. Further, the penis occasionally begins to become enlarged and erect, either in daydreams or at night. All of these changes take place slowly, over a period of months and years. They do not happen all at the same time in one person, nor do they happen at an exact age. In some people, they happen early and quickly, while in others, they can happen slowly. Also, each change does not become complete quickly either. So, for example, thick hair on the face in boys appears as a few scattered hairs first, and only slowly does the growth begin to become uniform. Even so, all these changes show differences between people. Just as we have differently shaped noses or fingers, so also we have different patterns of hair growth, or size and shape of breast or penis. All of these changes are aspects of the sexual maturation of the body. Why does the body show sexual maturation at this age? We have talked about the need for specialised cell types in multi-cellular bodies to carry out specialised functions. The creation of germ-cells to participate in sexual reproduction is another specialised function, and we have seen that plants develop special cell and tissue types to create them. Human beings also develop special tissues for this purpose. However, while the body of the individual organism is growing to its adult size, the resources of the body are mainly directed at achieving this growth. While that is happening, the maturation of the reproductive tissue is not likely to be a major priority. Thus, as the rate of general body growth begins to slow down, reproductive tissues begin to mature. This period during adolescence is called puberty. So how do all the changes that we have talked about link to the reproductive process? We must remember that the sexual mode of reproduction means that germ-cells from two individuals have to join together. This can happen by the external release of germ-cells from the bodies of individuals, as happens in flowering plants. Or it can happen by two individuals joining their bodies together for internal transfer of germ-cells for fusion, as happens in many animals. If animals are to

Electrical impulses are an excellent means of quick transfer of information in animals but there are limitations to the use of electrical impulses. List such two limitations. State the other means of communication used by most multi-cellular organisms between the cells. ,"Two limitations are : (i) They reach only those cells that are connected by nervous tissue and not each and every cell in the animal body. (ii) Once an electrical impulse is generated in a cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms before it can generate and transmit electrical impulse. Other means of communication is chemical communication or chemical co-ordination by compounds called hormones.","Electrical impulses are an excellent means for this. But there are limitations to the use of electrical impulses. Firstly, they will reach only those cells that are connected by nervous tissue, not each and every cell in the animal body. Secondly, once an electrical impulse is generated in a cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms before it can generate and transmit a new impulse. In other words, cells cannot continually create and transmit electrical impulses. It is thus no wonder that most multicellular organisms use another means of communication between cells, namely, chemical communication. If, instead of generating an electrical impulse, stimulated cells release a chemical compound, this compound would diffuse all around the original cell. If other cells around have the means to detect this compound using special molecules on their surfaces, then they would be able to recognise information, and even transmit it. This will be slower, of course, but it can potentially reach all cells of the body, regardless of nervous connections, and it can be done steadily and persistently. These compounds, or hormones used by multicellular organisms for control and coordination show a great deal of diversity, as we would expect. Different plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and responses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from where they act and simply diffuse to the area of action. Let us take an example that we have worked with earlier [Activity 7.2]. When growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised at the shoot tip, helps the cells to grow longer. When light is coming from one side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot. This concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the side of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to bend towards light. Another example of plant hormones are gibberellins which, like auxins, help in the growth of the stem. Cytokinins promote cell division, and it is natural then that they are present in greater concentration in areas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds. These are examples of plant hormones that help in promoting growth. But plants also need signals to stop growing. Abscisic acid is one example of a hormone which inhibits growth. Its effects include wilting of leaves.

A gland secretes a particular hormone. The deficiency of this hormone in the body causes a particular disease in which the blood sugar level rises. (i) Name the gland and the hormone secreted by it. (ii) Mention the role played by this hormone. (iii) Name the disease caused due to deficiency of this hormone.  5,"(i) Pancreas, hormone — Insulin. (ii) Helps in regulating the blood sugar levels. (iii) Diabetes.","If it is so important that hormones should be secreted in precise quantities, we need a mechanism through which this is done. The timing and amount of hormone released are regulated by feedback mechanisms. For example, if the sugar levels in blood rise, they are detected by the cells of the pancreas which respond by producing more insulin. As the blood sugar level falls, insulin secretion is reduced.

"A lady bought a new iron container and kept blue vitriol solution into it. On the next day, she found that the container becomes porous and the blue colour of the solution fades. She goes to the shopkeeper and complained. But the shopkeeper argued that the container is of good quality and will not give her money back. An aware person Mohan came there and asked the matter and told that the container is of good quality and you have kept the wrong substance in it, so fault is all yours. On the basis of the above passage, answer the following questions : (i) Why the container becomes porous when blue vitriol solution is kept into it ? (ii) What qualities are exhibited by Mohan ?","(i) Because iron being more reactive displaces copper from copper sulphate solution by itself and form green coloured ferrous sulphate.

Gold is a very precious metal. Pure gold is very soft and it is therefore not suitable for making jewellery. It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. But sometimes jewellers mix a large quantity of copper and silver in gold to earn more profit. (i) What precautions should you take while purchasing the gold jewellery ? (ii) Why does Government insist on purchasing Hall Marked jewellery ?,"(i) We should always purchase the gold jewellery from a branded shop with proper receipt and Hall Marked certificate. (ii) Government insists on purchasing hall marked jewellery as it contains the gold and its alloyed metal (i.e., copper or silver) in a fixed ratio. Associated Value : They will be more careful and educated and thus can’t be fooled easily while shopping jewellery and other products.","Pure gold, known as 24 carat gold, is very soft. It is, therefore, not suitable for making jewellery. It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. Generally, in India, 22 carat gold is used for making ornaments. It means that 22 parts of pure gold is alloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver.

"One day Madhu visited an aluminium industry with her father. She found that molten alumina was taken in the fused state for electrolytic reduction process. She asked her father the reason for using fused alumina as an electrolyte instead of the solution of aluminium salt, although the latter can save ample amount of energy. Madhu’s father was pleased with her why nothing could be done about that wastage of energy in that particular instance. What could be his explanation ? What values you infer from this passage ?","Aluminium cannot be prepared from its salt solution because of its highly electropositive nature. It does not get discharged at the cathode.

 3.4.5 Extracting Metals towards the Top of the Activity Series The metals high up in the reactivity series are very reactive. They cannot be obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example, carbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium, aluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals have more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained by electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium are obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals are deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas, chlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode). The reactions are – At cathode At anode
