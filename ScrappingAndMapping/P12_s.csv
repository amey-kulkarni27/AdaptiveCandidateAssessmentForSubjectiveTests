What is ‘Balance of Power’? How could a state achieve this? ,"‘Balance of Power’ is a component of traditional security policy—It is a widely accepted fact that countries of world never had same geography, population, financial resources, military, etc. So, balance of power is integral in states. When small countries look around them, they see that some countries are bigger and stronger. This is a clue to who might be a threat in the future. For instance, a neighbouring country may not say it is preparing for attack. There may be no obvious reason for attack. But the fact that this country is very powerful is a sign that some point in the future, it may choose to be aggressive. Governments are, therefore, very sensitive to the balance of power between their country and other countries. They do work hard to maintain a favourable balance of power with other countries, especially those close by, those with whom they have differences, or with those they have had conflicts in the past. A good part of maintaining a balance of power is to build up one’s military power, although economic and technological power are also important as they are the bases for military power.","Q.1. What is ‘Balance of Power’? How could a state achieve this? [NCERT] Ans. ‘Balance of Power’ is a component of traditional security policy—It is a widely accepted fact that countries of world never had same geography, population, financial resources, military, etc. So, balance of power is integral in states. When small countries look around them, they see that some countries are bigger and stronger. This is a clue to who might be a threat in the future.

A good part of maintaining a balance of power is to build up one’s military power, although economic and technological power are also important as they are the bases for military power. Q.2. What are the objectives of military alliances? Give an example of a functioning military, alliance with its specific objectives. [NCERT] Ans. An alliance is a coalition of states that coordinate their actions to deter or defend against military attack. Most alliances are formalised in written treaties and are based on a fairly clear identification of who constitutes the threat. Countries form alliances to increase the effective power relative to another country or alliance. NATO is a powerful organisation, which is still into existence. It aims at maintaining military security of American and West European countries that came under the leadership of USA. It also aims at maintaining military, cultural and economic dominance on western countries. Q.3. What are the four elements of security? Give an example of each. [CBSE Sample Paper] Ans. There are the four elements of security: 1. Deterrence: The condition where war is tried to be prevented, like nuclear power acted as a deterrent between both the super powers during the Cold War. 2. Military Power: To raise military power to limit or prevent the war and to face external power.
 3. Balance of power: Every country works hard to maintain a favourable balance of power, especially in military. For example, purchasing weapons from foreign countries for modernisation of military by India and Pakistan. 4. To form alliances: Some countries form an alliance to increase their military power and coordinate their actions to deter or defend against military attack done on any of the country. For example, ‘NATO’ and ‘Warsaw Pact’ were established by America and USSR respectively. Q.4. Explain the process of confidence building under traditional security conception. Ans. Traditional security also accepts confidence building as a means of avoiding violence. Confidence building is a process in which countries share their thoughts and information with their rivals. They tell each other about their military intentions and, up to a point, their military plans. This is a way to show that they are not planning a surprise attack. They also tell each other about the kind of forces they possess, and they may share information on where those forces are deployed. In short, confidence building is a process designed to ensure that rivals do not go to war through misunderstanding or misperception. Q.5. Explain the importance of cooperation in the field of ‘Traditional Security.’ [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. The importance of cooperation in the field of ‘Traditional Security’ is disarmament, arms control, and confidence building. Disarmament requires all states to give up certain kinds of weapons. For example, the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and 1992 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) banned the production and possession of these weapons. Arms control regulates the acquisition or development of weapons. The AntiBallistic Missile (ABM) Treaty 1972 tried to stop the United States and the Soviet Union from using ballistic missiles as a defensive shield to launch a nuclear attack. Confidence Building is accepted as a means of avoiding violence. It is a process in which countries share ideas and information with their rivals. Q.6. What is disarmament? Ans. Disarmament literally means ‘not keeping arms’. But no country can safeguard its boundaries without its military capability. So, disarmament refers to limit traditional weapons within a boundary by preventing nuclear weapons. The competition of weapons among countries have caused a global threat to international peace. The need of the hour is to end this competition and establish international peace. Q.7. What are the reasons behind increase in terrorism at international level?

 Explain balance of power as a component of traditional security policy. How could a state achieve this balance? [CBSE Delhi 2016] Ans. Traditional notion of external security– The greatest danger to a country is from military threats. The source of such a security threat emerges from another country which, through its military action, threatens the core values of sovereignity, independence and territorial integrity. Military action even endangers the life of ordinary residents of a country. In a war, it is highly unlikely that only soldiers would die or be hurt. In all the likelihood, men and women, who are ordinary citizens and soft targets are made victims in a war, to break their support for the war. Components of external security: 1. Avoidance of War: Governments may even make the choice of surrender when actually in a war, but this may not be promoted as a country’s defence policy. Security policy, is hence, concerned with preventing war, which is known as deterrence, and with limiting or ending war, which is called defence. 2. Balance of Power: Every country looks around to see potential bigger or stronger countries which can pose as a threat in the future. For instance, a neighbouring country might not declare that it is preparing for an attack. But the very fact, that the neighbour is powerful, points to the fact that in future the neighbour can be aggressive. Over here we can cite the example of South Asia. Even though India has never declared that it would attack upon its neighbours– Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, etc., yet these countries are skeptical about India’s military designs because of its preparedness, size and potential. All governments, are therefore, quite sensitive to the ‘Balance of Power’ between their country and other states. They strive hard to maintain a favourable balance with the other states especially with those with whom they had differences or conflicts in the past. For maintaining balance of power, they build up military power along with economic and technological power as the latter two are the very basis of a country’s hand or military power. Q.4.Write a note on ‘ways of traditional security policy’. Ans. The most important of these are disarmament arms control and confidence building: 1. Disarmament: It requires all states to give up certain kinds of weapons. For example, the 1972 Biological weapons convention (BWC) and the 1992 Chemical weapons convention (CWC) banned the production and possession of these weapons. More than 155 states acceded to the BWC and 181 states acceded to the CWC. Both conventions include all the great powers. But the superpowers — the US and Soviet Union did not want to give up the third type of weapons of mass destruction, namely, nuclear weapons, so they pursued arms control.

Explain the process of confidence building under traditional security conception.,"Traditional security also accepts confidence building as a means of avoiding violence. Confidence building is a process in which countries share their thoughts and information with their rivals. They tell each other about their military intentions and, up to a point, their military plans. This is a way to show that they are not planning a surprise attack. They also tell each other about the kind of forces they possess, and they may share information on where those forces are deployed. In short, confidence building is a process designed to ensure that rivals do not go to war through misunderstanding or misperception.","Alliance building comes under traditional security. Many countries are involved in an alliance. They take steps in the direction of preventing war or defend against military attack. It aims at national interests. Q.13. What are the choices available to a state when its security is threatened, according to traditional security perspective? [NCERT] Ans. In the traditional conception of security, the greatest danger to a country is from military threats. The source of this danger is another country which by threatening military action endangers the core values of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. Agriculture, trade, business and industries of the region of war are affected adversely. Quite often, ordinary women and men are made targets of war to break their support to the war. In responding to the threat of a war, a government has three basic choices: 1. To surrender 2. To prevent the other side from attacking by promising to raise the costs of war to an unacceptable level; 3. To defend itself when war actually breaks out so as to deny the attacking country its objectives. Q.14. Distinguish between the internal and external notion of traditional security. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Internal notion of traditional security: (i) Internal military conflicts.
 (ii) Separatist movements: Internally, these states feared threats from separatist movements which wanted to form independent states. Sometimes, both external and internal threats submerged. This was because a neighbour might aid and abet internal separatist movements leading to tension between the two neighbouring states. (iii) Internal wars: Internal wars now account for more than 95% of the armed conflicts all over the world. There has been a steep rise twelve times in the number of civil wars, between 1946 and 1991 the highest jump in over 200 years. External notion of traditional security: (i) Danger to a country from military threats The source of such a security threat emerges from another country which, through its military action, threatens the core values of sovereignity, independence and territorial integrity. Military action even endangers the life of ordinary residents of a country. In a war, it is highly unlikely that only soldiers would die or be hurt. In all the likelihood, men and women, who are ordinary citizens and soft targets are made victims in a war, to break their support for the war. (ii) Deterrence, defence and balance of power Governments may even make the choice of surrender when actually in a war, but this may not be promoted as a country’s defence policy. Security policy, is hence, concerned with preventing war, which is known as deterrence, and with limiting or ending war, which is called defence. (iii) Alliance building as components of traditional security An alliance is a coalition of countries to deter or defend themselves unitedly against any possible military attack. Most alliances are formal written treaties based on a clear identification of potential threatening countries. Countries form military alliances to revitalise their effective power strength against other possible military alliance threats. (Any two points) Q.15. Nuclear weapons as deterrence or defence have limited usage against contemporary security threats to states. Explain the statement. [NCERT] Ans. Non-traditional notions of security go beyond military threats to include a wide range of threats and dangers affecting the conditions of human existence. These threats are poverty, epidemic, global warming, etc. Military attack causes threat not only the country but also affects whole human existence. Hunger, disease and natural disasters kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined. When war was considered as the greatest threat condition to the security, it occurred due to nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are of no use in front of these threats at present. They cannot contribute in any way to solve them. Q.16. Rapid environmental degradation is causing a serious threat to security. Do you agree with the statement? Substantiate your arguments.
 3. Balance of power: Every country works hard to maintain a favourable balance of power, especially in military. For example, purchasing weapons from foreign countries for modernisation of military by India and Pakistan. 4. To form alliances: Some countries form an alliance to increase their military power and coordinate their actions to deter or defend against military attack done on any of the country. For example, ‘NATO’ and ‘Warsaw Pact’ were established by America and USSR respectively. Q.4. Explain the process of confidence building under traditional security conception. Ans. Traditional security also accepts confidence building as a means of avoiding violence. Confidence building is a process in which countries share their thoughts and information with their rivals. They tell each other about their military intentions and, up to a point, their military plans. This is a way to show that they are not planning a surprise attack.

In short, confidence building is a process designed to ensure that rivals do not go to war through misunderstanding or misperception. Q.5. Explain the importance of cooperation in the field of ‘Traditional Security.’ [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. The importance of cooperation in the field of ‘Traditional Security’ is disarmament, arms control, and confidence building. Disarmament requires all states to give up certain kinds of weapons.

Arms Control: Arms Control regulates the acquisition or development of weapons. The Anti-ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 1972 tried to stop the United States and Soviet Union from using ballistic missiles as a defensive shield to launch a nuclear attack. While it did allow both countries to deploy a very limited number of defensive systems, it stopped them from large-scale production of those systems. The US and Soviet Union signed a number of other arms control treaties including the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty II or SALT II and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). The Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 was an arms control treaty in the sense that it regulated the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Those countries that had tested and manufactured nuclear weapons before 1967were allowed to keep their weapons; and those that had done to were to give up the right to acquire them. 3. Confidence Building: Traditional security also accepts confidence building as a means of avoiding violence. Confidence building is a process in which countries share ideas and information with their rivals. They tell each other about their military intentions and, upto a point, their military plans. This is a way of show that they are not planning a surprise attack. They also update each other about the kind of forces they possess, and they may share information on where those forces are deployed. In short, confidence building is a process designed to ensure that countries do not go to war through misunderstanding or misperception. All in all, traditional conceptions of security are principally concerned with the use or threat of use of military force. In traditional security, force is both the principal threat to security and the principal means of achieving security. Q.5. Explain non-traditional conception of security. Ans. 1. Human security: Human security is all about the protection of people more than the protection of countries. Human security and state security should be same. But secure states do not automatically mean secure peoples. Protecting citizens from foreign attack may be a necessary condition for the security of individuals, but it is certainly not a sufficient one. Indeed, during the last 100 years, more people have been killed by their own governments than by foreign armies. All defenders of human security agree that its primary goal is the protection of individuals. However, there are differences about precisely what threats individuals should be protected from. Advocates of the ‘narrow’ concept of human security focus on violent threats to individuals or, as former UN secretary–General Kofi Annan puts it, “the protection of communities and individuals from internal violence.” Proponents of the ‘broad’ concept of human security argue that the threat agenda should include hunger, disease and natural disasters because these kill far more people than war, genocide and terrorism combined. Human security policy, they argue, should protect people from these threats and violence too. In its broadest formulation, the human security agenda also envelops economic security and ‘threats’ to ‘human dignity’. Put differently, the expansive formulation stresses what has been called ‘freedom from wants’ and ‘freedom from fear’ respectively.

What are the reasons behind increase in terrorism at international level?  ,"Following are the reasons behind increasing terrorism on international level: 1. Information and Technology have paved way for terrorism in its way of execution. That is why, terrorism is a global problem all over the world. 2. Globalisation of economy is responsible behind the situations like theft, hijacking plains or planting of bombs, etc. The exchange of currency of any country has become easier for terrorists. 3. There is a competition of selling modernised weapons. The mastermind, government and traders are equally responsible behind spreading terror at individual level. 4.

Information and Technology have paved way for terrorism in its way of execution. That is why, terrorism is a global problem all over the world. 2. Globalisation of economy is responsible behind the situations like theft, hijacking plains or planting of bombs, etc. The exchange of currency of any country has become easier for terrorists. 3. There is a competition of selling modernised weapons. The mastermind, government and traders are equally responsible behind spreading terror at individual level. 4. Advanced transport systems and mediums have enhanced terrorism. Q.8. Identify and elaborate any four sources of security threats. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. Following are the new sources of security threats: 1. Terrorism: It refers to political violence that targets civilians deliberately and indiscriminately. International terrorism involves the citizens or territory of more than one country. Terrorist groups seek to change a political context or condition that they do not like by force or threat of force. Civilian targets are usually chosen to terrorise the public and to use the unhappiness of the public as a weapon against national governments or other parties in conflict. 2. Global Poverty: Global Poverty is another source of insecurity. World population now at 650 crore will reach 700 to 800 within 25 years and may eventually level out of 900 to 1000 crore. Currently, half the world’s population growth occurs in just six countries—India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Among the World’s poorest countries, population is expected to triple in the next 50 years, whereas many rich countries will see population’s shrinkage in that period. High growth rate, high per capita income, high Education level and low population growth will make rich states or rich social groups get richer where as low growth rate, low per capita income, low education level and huge population growth reinforce each other to make poor states and poor groups become poorer. 3. Migration: Poverty in the South has also led to large-scale migration to seek a better life, especially better economic opportunities in the North. This has created international political frictions. International law and norms make a distinction between migrants and refugees. States are generally supposed to accept refugees,but they do not have to accept migrants. While refugees leave their country of origin, people who have fled their homes but remain within national borders are called internally displaced people. 4.

Identify and elaborate any four sources of security threats. ,"Following are the new sources of security threats: 1. Terrorism: It refers to political violence that targets civilians deliberately and indiscriminately. International terrorism involves the citizens or territory of more than one country. Terrorist groups seek to change a political context or condition that they do not like by force or threat of force. Civilian targets are usually chosen to terrorise the public and to use the unhappiness of the public as a weapon against national governments or other parties in conflict. 2. Global Poverty: Global Poverty is another source of insecurity. World population now at 650 crore will reach 700 to 800 within 25 years and may eventually level out of 900 to 1000 crore. Currently, half the world’s population growth occurs in just six countries—India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Among the World’s poorest countries, population is expected to triple in the next 50 years, whereas many rich countries will see population’s shrinkage in that period. High growth rate, high per capita income, high Education level and low population growth will make rich states or rich social groups get richer where as low growth rate, low per capita income, low education level and huge population growth reinforce each other to make poor states and poor groups become poorer. 3. Migration: Poverty in the South has also led to large-scale migration to seek a better life, especially better economic opportunities in the North. This has created international political frictions. International law and norms make a distinction between migrants and refugees. States are generally supposed to accept refugees,but they do not have to accept migrants. While refugees leave their country of origin, people who have fled their homes but remain within national borders are called internally displaced people. 4. Health Epidemics: Health Epidemics such as HIV-AIDS, bird flu, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have rapidly spread across countries through migration,  business, tourism and military operations. One country’s success or failure in limiting the spread of these diseases affects infections in other countries. By 2003, an estimated 4 crore people were infected with HIV-AIDS worldwide, twothirds of them in Africa and half of the rest in South Asia.","[CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. Following are the reasons behind increasing terrorism on international level: 1. Information and Technology have paved way for terrorism in its way of execution. That is why, terrorism is a global problem all over the world. 2. Globalisation of economy is responsible behind the situations like theft, hijacking plains or planting of bombs, etc. The exchange of currency of any country has become easier for terrorists. 3. There is a competition of selling modernised weapons. The mastermind, government and traders are equally responsible behind spreading terror at individual level. 4. Advanced transport systems and mediums have enhanced terrorism. Q.8. Identify and elaborate any four sources of security threats. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans.

How many types of human rights are there?,"Human rights is an issue of human security. Human rights have come to be classified into three types: 1. Political Right seen as voting right, right to contest election and freedom of speech and assembly. 2. Economic and social rights such as right to earn, right to work, right of social security, etc. 3. Right to colonised people or ethnic and indigenous minorities. More emphasis have been given to these rights but there is no agreement on which set of rights should be considered as universal human rights, nor what the international community should do when rights are being violated. Since the 1990s, developments such as Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, the genocide in Rwanda, and the Indonesian military’s killing of people in East Timor have led to a debate on whether or not the UN should intervene to stop human rights abuses.

List any four policy directive principles of state mentioned in Indian constitution to promote and international peace and security. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Measures of environmental protection, security to wild animals and increase in international peace and security have been mentioned in Article 51 of Indian constitution. On the basis of which India would regulate its foreign policy. Following are the principles: 1. To increase international peace and security. 2. To maintain justified and respectful relations between nations. 3. Foster respect for international law and treaty obligations in the dealings of organised peoples with one another. 4. To make efforts to mediate international controversies and promote settlement of international disputes by arbitration. Q.11. Explain the concept of ‘Human Security.’ [CBSE (AI) 2015]
 Ans. Human Security means the protection of the people more than the protection of states. The proponents of human security argue that the primary aim of the state is the protection of its individuals. According to them the concept of human security should include hunger, diseases and natural disasters as they kill even more people than war.Thus, human security should protect people from these threats as well as from violence and war. In its broadest formulation, the human security agenda also encompasses economic security and ‘threats to human dignity’. Q.12. Explain four components of India’s security strategy. [CBSE Delhi, (AI) 2014] Ans. India’s security strategy has four broad components, which have been used in a varying combinations from time to time. 1. Strengthening Military Capabilities: India has been involved in conflicts with its neighbour—Pakistan in 1947-48, 1965, 1971 and 1999; and China in 1962. Since it is surrounded by nuclear-armed countries in the South Asian Region, India’s decision to conduct nuclear test in 1998 was justified by the Indian government in terms of safeguarding national security. India first tested a nuclear device in 1974. 2. Strengthen International Norms: India’s security strategy has been to strengthen international norms and international institutions to protect its security interests. India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru supported the cause of Asian solidarity, decolonisation, disarmament and the UN as a forum in which international conflicts could be settled. Most importantly it used non-alignment to help carve out an area of peace outside the bloc politics of the two superpowers. India joined 160 countries that have signed and ratified the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which provides a road map for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases to check global warming. Indian troops have been sent abroad on UN peacekeeping missions in support of cooperative security initiatives. 3. Internal Security: The third component of Indian security strategy is geared towards meeting security challenges within the country. Several militant groups from areas such as Nagaland, Mizoram, Punjab and Kashmir among others have, from time to time sought to break away from India. India has tried to preserve national unity by adopting a democratic political system, which allows different communities and groups of people to freely articulate their grievances and share political power. 4. Economic Growth: There has been an attempt in India to develop its economy in a way that the vast mass of citizens are lifted out of poverty and misery and huge economic inequalities are not allowed to exist. The attempt has not quite succeeded; we are still a very poor and unequal country. Yet democratic politics allows spaces for articulating the voice of the poor and the deprived citizens.

Mention any three features that distinguish the Soviet economy from that of a capitalist country like the US. [NCERT] Ans. (i) Soviet economy abolished the institution of private property and consciously designed a society based on the principles of equality. Land and productive assets were owned and controlled with Soviet States. (ii) On the contrary to capitalist economy, Soviet economy gave primacy to state and institution of the communist party. Russia dominated in every area. People from other regions felt neglected and suppressed. (iii) Unlike capitalist countries, economy of Soviet union was planned and controlled by the state. Private companies, private entrepreneurs, production and distribution were kept away whereas in capitalist country like USA, land and other productive assets, factories, mills, companies, etc. were owned by individuals or group of individuals, companies or capitalists or entrepreneurs. Soviet Union used much of its resources in maintaining a nuclear and military arsenal. Its arms race with the US deprived citizen of their economical and high living standards. Q.3. Write any two reasons responsible for disintegration of Soviet Union. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Or Clarify any three reasons responsible for the disintegration of Soviet Union. [CBSE Delhi 2014]
 ‘perestroika’(restructuring) and glasnost (openness). He decided to improve relations with Western countries along with America on the domestic front. 5. Gorbachev felt that economy had become stagnant. This led to shortage of all consumer goods. A large part of population started having doubted outlook for governing system. 6. The public of Soviet Union was dissatisfied with the bureaucratic and authoritarian system. In spite of similarities among all republics of Soviet Union, people felt neglected and suppressed due to increased domination of Russia. Members and managers at governing state had more facilities as compared to common people. This also led to public outrage. 7. A Coup took place in 1991, which was encouraged by Communist party hardliners. The people had tasted freedom by then and did not want the old-style rule of the communist party. All these factors forced Gorbachev to reform. Q.5. Describe the loopholes of Soviet System. [CBSE Delhi 2010] Ans. Soviet Union Emerged as a superpower after the Second World War. It developed in all areas but still it had the following loopholes which led to its destruction: 1. The economic, social and political life of Soviet citizens was fully under the control of state. Soviet system became very bureaucratic making life very difficult for its citizens. 2. Communist party of Soviet Union had a tight control over all institutions and was unaccountable to the people. The party bureaucrats gained more privilege than ordinary citizens, which increased in satisfaction among common citizens. 3. Lack of democracy and the absence of freedom of speech stifled people, who often expressed their dissent in jokes and cartoons. 4. The party refused to recognized the urge of people in the fifteen different republic that formed the Soviet union to manage their own affairs including their cultural affairs. Although on paper, Russia was only one of the fifteen republics that together constituted the USSR. But in reality, Russia dominated everything and people from other regions felt neglected and often suppressed. 5. In the arms race, the Soviet Union managed to match the US from time to time, but at great cost. The Soviet Union lagged behind the west in technology, infrastructure (e.g., transport, power) and most importantly, in fulfilling the political or economic aspirations of citizens. 6. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 weakened the system even further. Though wages continued to grow, productivity and technology fell considerably behind that of the West. This led to the shortages in all consumer goods. Food imports increased every year. Q.6. Explain process of disintegration of Soviet Union during the period of Mikhail Gorbachev.
 Ans. Mikhail Gorbachev became president of Soviet Union in 1985. Reforms were necessary to keep the USSR abreast of the information and technological revolutions taking place in West. To resolve this situation, he introduced reform policies of ‘perestroika’ (restructuring) and ‘glasnost’ (openness); However Gorbachev’s decision to normaliserelations with the West and democratise and reforms the Soviet Union had some other effects that neither he nor anyone else intended or anticipated. The people in the East European countries, which were earlier the part of the Soviet bloc started to protest against their own governments and Soviet control. Unlike in the past, the Soviet Union, under Gorbachev, did not intervene when the disturbances occurred and the communist regimes collapsed one after another. These developments were accompanied by a rapidly escalating crisis within the USSR that hastened its disintegration. Gorbachev initiated the policies of economic and political reform and democratisation within the country. The reforms were opposed by leaders within the communist party. This increased the speed of disintegration of Soviet Union. The effect of ‘Glasnost’ (openness) policy first took place in Lithuania. Movement for the freedom from USSR began. Soon it spread to Estonia and Latvia. But Gorbachev took the favour of Glasnost instead resolving the matter. In October 1989, he declared that Warsaw pact members were free to decide their own future. In the next month, November 1989, citizens of Germany toppled the Berlin Wall. In February 1990, elections held at Soviet Parliament (Duma). Gorbachev stripped the Soviet Communist Party of its 72 years old monopoly owned power by calling on the Soviet Parliament (Duma) to permit multiparty politics. It had surprising consequences. The communist party which ruled for last 72 years lost the elections. Lithunia declared its independence in March 1990. Russian Parliament declared its independence from Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin played an important role in this process. This was the most deepest indication of disintegration of Soviet Union. The public revolt that occurred to remove of communist party in all the republics of Soviet Union after falling of Berlin Wall in 1989 was so powerful that it wasn’t possible to resolve it with the help of military force. In December 1991, under the leadership of Yeltsin, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, three major republics of the USSR, declared that the Soviet Union was disbanded. And in this way, Soviet Union was disintegrated. Q.7. Explain how did the Cuban Missile Crisis drive the world on the brink of a nuclear war? [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. (i) In April 1961, the USSR was worried that USA would attack Cuba and overthrow the government of Fidel Castro. Therefore, the leaders of Cuba decided to convert the country into a Russian base. (ii) Consequently, the USSR placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. This strategic move put the USA for the first time, under the fire from close range.

Write any two reasons responsible for disintegration of Soviet Union.  Or Clarify any three reasons responsible for the disintegration of Soviet Union.  ,"Political leaders and ideologists have different methodology on the subject of reasons of disintegration of Soviet Union. Soviet Union was disintegrated due to the following reasons: 1. Leaders of Soviet Union guaranteed respected standard of living after Soviet revolution to common citizens, who were unable to manage the square meals during bureaucratic and authoritarian system at the time of establishment of Soviet System. There was an improvement in the standard of living of Soviet citizens after revolution undoubtedly. But the reforms couldn’t bring out the improvements to an appropriate level which gave rise to the dissatisfaction amongst citizens. 2. Communist party had an undocked control over Soviet Union. Party failed to accomplish/fulfil the aspirations of public. Public of republics felt neglected and suppressed under the domination of Russia. 3. Soviet Union emerged as a superpower after the Second World War. Due to this, the other superpower America had to compete.

This affected the way to improve economic life of the people. Q.4. Explain any four consequences of Shock Therapy. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Main consequences of shock therapy, adopted in 1990 were as follows: 1. Collapse of Industries: In Russia, the large state-controlled industrial complex almost collapsed, as about 90 per cent of its industries were put up for sale to private individuals and companies. Since the restructuring was carried out through market forces and not by the government – directed industrial policies, it led to the virtual disappearance of all the industries. This was called ‘the largest garage sale in history’ as valuable industries were undervalued and sold at throwaway prices. 2. Collapse of Food Security: The value of the ruble, the Russian currency, declined dramatically. The rate of inflation was so high that people lost all their savings. The collective farm system disintegrated leaving people without food security, and Russia started to import food. 3. Social Change: The old system of social welfare was systematically destroyed. The withdrawal of government subsidies pushed large sections of the people into poverty. The middle classes were pushed to the periphery of society, and the academic and intellectual man power disintegrated or migrated. A mafia emerged in most of these countries and started controlling many economic activities. Privatisation led to new disparities. Post-Soviet states, especially Russia, were
 ‘perestroika’(restructuring) and glasnost (openness). He decided to improve relations with Western countries along with America on the domestic front. 5. Gorbachev felt that economy had become stagnant. This led to shortage of all consumer goods. A large part of population started having doubted outlook for governing system. 6. The public of Soviet Union was dissatisfied with the bureaucratic and authoritarian system. In spite of similarities among all republics of Soviet Union, people felt neglected and suppressed due to increased domination of Russia. Members and managers at governing state had more facilities as compared to common people. This also led to public outrage. 7. A Coup took place in 1991, which was encouraged by Communist party hardliners. The people had tasted freedom by then and did not want the old-style rule of the communist party. All these factors forced Gorbachev to reform. Q.5. Describe the loopholes of Soviet System. [CBSE Delhi 2010] Ans. Soviet Union Emerged as a superpower after the Second World War. It developed in all areas but still it had the following loopholes which led to its destruction: 1. The economic, social and political life of Soviet citizens was fully under the control of state. Soviet system became very bureaucratic making life very difficult for its citizens. 2. Communist party of Soviet Union had a tight control over all institutions and was unaccountable to the people. The party bureaucrats gained more privilege than ordinary citizens, which increased in satisfaction among common citizens. 3. Lack of democracy and the absence of freedom of speech stifled people, who often expressed their dissent in jokes and cartoons. 4. The party refused to recognized the urge of people in the fifteen different republic that formed the Soviet union to manage their own affairs including their cultural affairs. Although on paper, Russia was only one of the fifteen republics that together constituted the USSR. But in reality, Russia dominated everything and people from other regions felt neglected and often suppressed. 5. In the arms race, the Soviet Union managed to match the US from time to time, but at great cost. The Soviet Union lagged behind the west in technology, infrastructure (e.g., transport, power) and most importantly, in fulfilling the political or economic aspirations of citizens. 6. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 weakened the system even further. Though wages continued to grow, productivity and technology fell considerably behind that of the West. This led to the shortages in all consumer goods. Food imports increased every year. Q.6. Explain process of disintegration of Soviet Union during the period of Mikhail Gorbachev.
 Ans. Mikhail Gorbachev became president of Soviet Union in 1985. Reforms were necessary to keep the USSR abreast of the information and technological revolutions taking place in West. To resolve this situation, he introduced reform policies of ‘perestroika’ (restructuring) and ‘glasnost’ (openness); However Gorbachev’s decision to normaliserelations with the West and democratise and reforms the Soviet Union had some other effects that neither he nor anyone else intended or anticipated. The people in the East European countries, which were earlier the part of the Soviet bloc started to protest against their own governments and Soviet control. Unlike in the past, the Soviet Union, under Gorbachev, did not intervene when the disturbances occurred and the communist regimes collapsed one after another. These developments were accompanied by a rapidly escalating crisis within the USSR that hastened its disintegration. Gorbachev initiated the policies of economic and political reform and democratisation within the country. The reforms were opposed by leaders within the communist party. This increased the speed of disintegration of Soviet Union. The effect of ‘Glasnost’ (openness) policy first took place in Lithuania. Movement for the freedom from USSR began. Soon it spread to Estonia and Latvia. But Gorbachev took the favour of Glasnost instead resolving the matter. In October 1989, he declared that Warsaw pact members were free to decide their own future. In the next month, November 1989, citizens of Germany toppled the Berlin Wall. In February 1990, elections held at Soviet Parliament (Duma). Gorbachev stripped the Soviet Communist Party of its 72 years old monopoly owned power by calling on the Soviet Parliament (Duma) to permit multiparty politics. It had surprising consequences. The communist party which ruled for last 72 years lost the elections. Lithunia declared its independence in March 1990. Russian Parliament declared its independence from Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin played an important role in this process. This was the most deepest indication of disintegration of Soviet Union. The public revolt that occurred to remove of communist party in all the republics of Soviet Union after falling of Berlin Wall in 1989 was so powerful that it wasn’t possible to resolve it with the help of military force. In December 1991, under the leadership of Yeltsin, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, three major republics of the USSR, declared that the Soviet Union was disbanded. And in this way, Soviet Union was disintegrated. Q.7. Explain how did the Cuban Missile Crisis drive the world on the brink of a nuclear war? [CBSE Sample Paper 2015] Ans. (i) In April 1961, the USSR was worried that USA would attack Cuba and overthrow the government of Fidel Castro. Therefore, the leaders of Cuba decided to convert the country into a Russian base. (ii) Consequently, the USSR placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. This strategic move put the USA for the first time, under the fire from close range.
 (iii) This move of the USSR made the Americans aware of an imminent danger. The US president J.F. Kennedy was determined to get Nikita Khrushchev to remove the missiles and nuclear weapons from Cuba. (iv) The American warships were ordered to intercept the Soviet ships heading towards Cuba. The overall situation became tense and volatile. (v)The prospects of this clash made the whole world nervous, for it would have been no ordinary war. The Cuban Missile Crisis was a high point of what came to be known as the Cold War. Q.8. How did the Soviet Union suddenly disintegrate? Explain any six reasons. [CBSE (AI) 2016] Or Describe any six factors responsible for the disintegration of USSR. [CBSE Delhi 2015] Ans. Political leaders and ideologists have different methology on the subject of reasons of disintegration of Soviet Union. Soviet Union was disintegrated due to the following reasons: 1. Leaders of Soviet Union guaranteed respected standard of living after Soviet revolution to common citizens, who were unable to manage square meals during bureaucratic and authoritarian system at the time of establishment of Soviet System. There was an improvement in the standard of living of Soviet citizens afterrevolution undoubtedly. But the reforms couldn’t bring out the improvements to an appropriate level, which raised dissatisfaction among citizens. 2. Communist party had a complete control over Soviet Union. Party failed to accomplish/fulfill the aspirations of public. Public of republics felt neglected and suppressed under the domination of Russia. 3. Soviet Union emerged as a superpower after the Second World War. Due to this, the other superpower, America had to compete. Arms race began after the formation of Soviet Union. It emerged as an atomic power in 1948-49. Ths US progressed continuously and consistently whereas Soviet Union’s resources were wasted in the competition. This affected the development and improvement of economic life of people. 4. Some people believed that Soviet Union had dominated Eastern Europe after the Second World War. Soviet Union had to opt a policy for the development of those countries by sparing a large part of its economic equipments in order to gain an effective control on them. 5. Communist party was the only party that ruled for 72 years after the revolution of 1917. Due to this, the party members became bureaucrats. They were not answerable to citizens. Furthermore, the standard of living of members and

What are the reasons for growing concerns about the environment? ,Environment concern is a very serious issue because of the following facts: (i) Cultivable area throughout the world is decreasing and losing in fertility. (ii) Water bodies getting polluted due to pollution. (iii) Rapid decline in the total amount of ozone in the earth’s stratosphere. (iv) Global coastal pollution has increased due to land based activities.,"Q.1. Why there is a sharp decline in the quality of coastal pollution? Ans. 1. Coastal land-based activities 2. Intensive human settlement in coastal zones. Q.2. Why have fishing industries been destroyed in the Aral sea? Ans. Around the Aral sea, toxic water have completely destroyed the fishing industry. Q.3. What was the point of concern of Northern States in ‘Rio Summit’? Ans. Northern states were concerned with Ozone depletion and global warming. Q.4. Why is it said that history of petroleum is also the history of war and struggles? [CBSE (AI) 2016] Ans. It is true because World Economy is based on petroleum and immense wealth is associated with oil. It generates political struggles and wars to have control over it. Q.5. What was the cause of worry of Southern states? Ans. Southern states were anxious to address the relationship between economic development and environmental management. Q.6. What is way of ‘Sustainable development’? Ans. ‘Sustainable development’ is an approach of economic development without harming the environment. Q.7. What is the role of Antarctica continent with respect to world atmosphere? Ans. Antarctica maintains climate equilibrium in the world. Q.8. How is marine ecosystem of Antarctica? Ans. Antarctica has a highly productive marine ecosystem, comprising of few plants (e.g., microscopic algae, fungi and lichen) marine mammal, fish and hoards of birds adapted to harsh conditions. Q.9. What are the reasons for increase in pollution in Antarctica? Ans. Globally, coastal pollution is increasing. Although the open sea is relatively clean, the coastal waters are becoming increasingly polluted largely due to land-based activities. Q.10. Why has land environment been an issue?
 Ans. Land environment is an issue because throughout the world, cultivable area is barely expanding anymore and a substantial portion of existing agricultural land is losing futility, grasslands have been overgrazed and fisheries over harvested. Water bodies have suffered extensive depletion. Q.11. Why did thousands of people have to leave their homes around the Aral sea? Ans. Around the Aral sea, thousands of people had to leave their homes as the toxic water has completely destroyed the fishing industry. The shipping industry and all related activities have collapsed. Rising concentration of salt has caused low crop yields. Numerous studies have been conducted but no solution to the problems has been found. Q.12. Identify the most important outcome of the Rio Summit. [CBSE (AI) 2015] Ans. Outcomes of Rio Summit: (i) The Rio Summit produced conventions dealing with climate change, biodiversity, forestry, etc. (ii) It recommended a list of developmental practices called ‘Agenda 21.’ (iii) There was consensus on sustainable development. (Any one) Q.13. What changes can be seen in the outer atmosphere of the Earth? Ans. Amount of Ozone gas is decreasing due to the hole in the ozone layer of atmosphere. A steady decline in the total amount of ozone in the Earth’s stratosphere poses a real danger to the ecosystems and human health. Q.14. What is the importance of ‘Antarctica Region’? Ans. Antarctic plays an important role in maintaining climatic equilibrium and deep ice cores provide an important source of information about greenhouse gas concentrations and atmospheric temperatures of hundred and thousands of years ago. It comprises 90 per cent of all terrestrial ice and 70 per cent of planetary fresh water. Q.15. Why have issues related to global environmental protection become a priority concern of states since the 1990s? [NCERT] Ans. The consequences on environment due to economic development were felt by various countries from 1960. In 1990s, issues related to global environmental protection became the priority concerns. The growing focus on environmental issues within the arena of global politics was firmly consolidated at the United Nations conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 1992. This was also called the Earth Summit. The Summit

Explain the role of Environment Movements to meet the challenge of Environmental Degradation. ,"Environmental movements meet the challenge of environmental degradation by: (i) Social movements such as the Chipko movement resist the degradation of their surrounding environment and become a popular movement. (ii) They ensure information campaigns in school, colleges and through popular media to highlight issues of environmental degradation. (iii) They pressurise governments to effectively combat climate change such as in Paris negotiations. (iv) These movements began ground campaigns such as cleaning beaches, etc. and thereby involve public participation. ","[NCERT] Ans. It has become essential to adopt some ways of environment conservation because of environment degradation due to economic development. But this poses a great threat to pace of economic development. It is a serious challenge in front of world to adopt such approach which neither affect or degrade the environment nor slows down the pace of economic development. From state level to international level steps and initiatives have been taken in this direction. Most significant responses to this challenge have come not from the governments but rather from groups of environmentally conscious volunteers working in different part of the world. It is within social movements that new forms of political action are born on reinvented. These movements raise new ideas and long-term visions of what we should do and what we should not do in our individual and collective lives. Here are just a few examples to show that diversity is an important trait of contemporary environmental movements. 1. Movement in Favour of forest: Forest clearing in the Third world countries at an alarming rate, despite three decades of environmental activism. The destruction of the world’s last remaining grand forests has actually increased in last decade. The forest movement of the South, in Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Malaysia, Indonesia, Continental Africa and India, etc. are faced with enormous pressures. 2. Mines Related Movements: The minerals industry is one of the most powerful forms of industry on the planet. A large number of economies of the South are now being reopened to MNCs through the liberalisation of the global economy. The mineral industry’s extraction of earth, its use of chemicals, its pollution of waterways and land, its clearance of native vegetation, its displacements of community, amongst other factors, continue to invite criticism and resistance in various parts of the world. One example is that of the Philippines, where a vast network of groups and organisations campaigned against the Western Mining Corporation (WMC), an Australia-based multinational company. Much opposition to the company in its own country. 3. Dam Opposing Movements: Another groups of movements are those involved in struggles against mega dams. In every country where a mega dam is being built, one is likely to find an environmental movement opposing it. Increasingly antidam movements are pro-river movements for more sustainable and equitablemanagement of river systems and valleys. The early 1980s saw the first anti-dam movement launched in the North, namely, the campaign to save the Franklin River and its surrounding forests in Australia. At present, there has been a spurt in mega- dam building in the South, from Turkey to Thailand to South Africa, from Indonesia to China. India has had some of the leading anti-dam pro river movements. Narmada Bachao Andolan and Tehri movement are examples of such movements. It is significant note that, in anti-dam and other environmental movements in India, the most important shared idea is nonviolence. Q.20. Explain the arguments in favour of India on environment related issues. [CBSE Delhi 2013]
 Or Explain arguments in favour of India on any three issues of environment. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. Arguments in favour of India on issues related to environment are as follows: 1. India signed and ratified the 1997 Kyoto Protocol in August 2002. India, China and other developing countries were exempted from the requirement of the Kyoto Protocol because their contribution to the emission of greenhouse gases during the industrialisation period was not significant. However, at the G-8 meeting in June2005, India pointed out that the per capita emission rates of developing countries are a tiny fraction of those in the developed world. Following the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. India is of the view that the major responsibility of curbing emission rests with the developed countries, which have accumulated emissions over a long period of time. 2. India’s international negotiating position relies heavily on principles of historical responsibility, as enshrined in UNFCCC. This acknowledges that developed countries are responsible for most historical and current greenhouse gas emissions, and emphasizes that economic and socio development are the first and overridingpriorities of the developing country parties’, so India is wary of recent discussions within UNFCCC about introducing binding commitments on speedily industrialising countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. India feels the controversies that very spirit of UNFCCC. Neither does it seem fair to impose restrictions on India when the country’s rise in per capita carbon emission by 2030 is likely to still represent less than half the world average of 3.8 tonnes in 2000. Indian emissions are predicted to rise from 0.9 tonnes per capita in 2000 to 1.6 tonnes per capita in 2030. 3. The Indian government is already participating in global efforts through a number of programmes. For example, India’s National Auto-fuel Policy mandates cleaner fuels for vehicles. The Energy Conservation Act, passed in 2001, outlines initiatives to improve energy efficiency. Similarly, the Electricity Act of 2003 advocates and promotes the use of renewable energy. Recent trends in importing natural gas and encouraging the adoption of clean coal technologies show that India has been making true efforts. The government also intended to launch a National Mission on Biodiesel, using about 11 million hectares of land to produce bio diesel by 2011-12. And India has one of the largest renewable energy programmes in the world. 4. A review of the implementation of the agreements at the Earth Summit in Rio was undertaken by India at 1997. One of the key conclusions was that there had been no meaningful progress with respect to transfer of new and additional financial resources and environmentally sound technology on concessional terms to developing nations. India encourage SAARC countries to adopt a common position on major global environmental issues, so that the region’s voice carries greater weight. Q.21. Compromise and accommodation are the two essential policies required by states to save planet Earth. Substantiate the statement in the light of the ongoing negotiations between the North and South on environmental issues.
 [NCERT] Ans. Issues of environment is not just related to any individual or country, rather it is related to all those people of countries living on Earth. Thus, in order to save it, mutual and cooperative efforts are required instead of individual efforts. It is important that every country adopts the policy of resolvement and cooperation. There is difference in the approach to environment between the countries of the North and the South. The developed countries of the North want to discuss the environmental issue as it stands now and wants everyone to be equally responsible for ecological conservation. The developing countries of the south feel that much of the ecological degradation in the world is the result of industrial development undertaken by the developed countries. If they have caused more degradation, they must also take more responsibility for undoing the damage now. Moreover, the developing countries are in the process of industrialisation and they must not be subjected to the same restrictions, which apply to the developed countries. Thus, the special needs of the developing countries must be taken into consideration in the development, application, and interpretation of rules of international environmental law. This argument was accepted in the Rio Declaration at the Earth Summit in 1992 and is called the principle of Common but differentiated responsibilities. The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also provides that the parties should act to protect the climate system on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities. The parties to the Convention, agreed that the largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries. It was also acknowledged that per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low. China, India, and other developing countries were, therefore, exempted from the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol. Q.22. What are ‘global commons’? Why is it said that international cooperation over the global commons is not easy? [CBSE Delhi 2016] Ans. Global commons are the resources which are not owned by any one country but rather owned by international community such as earth’s atmosphere, Antarctica, the ocean floor and the outer space. It is difficult to achieve consensus on common environmental agenda. History of outer space as global common shows that the management of these areas is influenced by North East inequalities. Like Earth’s atmosphere and the ocean floor, the crucial issue here is technology and development. The benefits of exploitative activities in outer space are far from being equal either for the present or the future.
 One example that can be cited is of the Philippines, where a vast network of groups and organisations campaigned against the Western Mining Corporation (WMC), an Australia-based multinational company. Q.5. Explain the role of Environment Movements to meet the challenge of Environmental Degradation. [CBSE Delhi 2016] Ans. Environmental movements meet the challenge of environmental degradation by: (i) Social movements such as the Chipko movement resist the degradation of their surrounding environment and become a popular movement. (ii) They ensure information campaigns in school, colleges and through popular media to highlight issues of environmental degradation. (iii) They pressurise governments to effectively combat climate change such as in Paris negotiations. (iv) These movements began ground campaigns such as cleaning beaches, etc. and thereby involve public participation.

Q.1 What is globalisation? Enlighten any three reasons for globalisation. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Or Define globalisation. Explain any three reasons for globalisation. ,"Globalisation means globalise the social relationship in such a way that events taking place in some parts of the world could have an impact on another part of the world. Thus, globalisation is a process in which whole earth became a global village, in which socio-economic contact is based on mutual cooperation. Main reasons for Globalisation are as follows: 1. Revolution in Communication Technique: Technology remains a critical element. There is no doubt that the invention of telegraph, the telephone, and the microchip in more recent times has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. When printing initially came into being, it laid the basis for the creation of nationalism. Technology has affected us at individual and collective levels. Technological advancements have stimulated the transfer and movement of capital, thoughts, commodities and people from one part of the world to another and that too, easily. The movement of capital and commodities has been more than the movement of peoples across different parts of the world. 2. Flow of Capital and Commodities: Economic concept of the world has to play an important role in world politics. The mention of economic globalisation draws our attention immediately to the role of international institutions like IMF and the WTO and the role they play in determining economic policies across the world. Yet globalisation must not be viewed in such narrow terms. Economic globalisation involves many factors other than these international institutions. A much broader way of understanding of economic globalisation require us to look at the distribution of economic gains, i.e., who get the most from globalisation and who gets less, indeed who loses from it. 3. Impact of an event on all the people of World: Globalisation, however, does not emerge merely because of the availability of improved communications. What is important is for people in different parts of the world is to recognise these interconnections with the rest of the world. Currently, we are aware of the fact that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on the another part of the world. The Bird Flu or Tsunami is not confined to any particular nation. It does not respect national boundaries. Similarly, when major economic events take place, their  impact is felt outside their immediate local, national or regional environment at the international level.","Q.1 What is globalisation?

 impact is felt outside their immediate local, national or regional environment at the international level. Q.2. What is global ‘mutual connection’? What are its components? [NCERT] Ans. Global mutual connection means the free flow of ideas, capital commodities and people from one part of the world to another. In present times, different parts of world have come close to each other. And its credit goes to the development of means of communication. The invention of telegraph, the telephone and the microchips has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. Printing connected people living at different corners of the globe. But Globalisation however does not emerge merely because of the availability of improved communications. But people in different partsof the world recognise that they are connected to each other.

How do technologies contribute in the direction of globalisation? Explain. [CBSE Delhi 2013, CBSE Delhi 2015] Or How has technology contributed to the globalisation? [NCERT] Ans. Revolution in Communication Technique: Technology remains a critical element. There is no doubt that the invention of telegraph, the telephone, and the microchip in more recent times has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world.

Technological advancements have stimulated the transfer and movement of capital, thoughts, commodities and people from one part of the world to another and that too, easily. The movement of capital and commodities has been more than the movement of peoples across different parts of the world. Q.4. Why is globalisation a multidimensional concept? Ans. Globalisation is a multidimensional concept because it cannot be limited within a certain sphere. Its effect can be seen in all the sectors like economic, political and cultural. It would be a blunder to accept globalisation only as an economic, political or a cultural event. The impact of globalisation is vastly uneven— it affects some parts more than others. Q.5. Define globalisation. Explain any one criticism for globalisation. [CBSE Delhi (C) 2014]
 Ans.Globalisation means globalise the social relationship in such a manner that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on another part of the world. Thus globalisation is a process in which whole earth became a global village, in which socioeconomic contact is based on mutual corporation. Apart from the sphere of economics and politics, Globalisation has affected us culturally. What we eat, drink, think and wear reflect our culture. Imposition of Western Culture on the rest of the world is leading the world to homogenous culture. It is the result of US Hegemony. Cultures seeking to buy into the dominant American dream is dangerous not only for poor countries but also for the whole of humanity, for it might lead to the shinkage of the rich cultural heritage of the entire globe. Q.6. Clarify any two positive and any two negative effects of globalisation. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. Two positive effects of globalisation are as follows: (i) As a consequence of globalisation, enhanced technologies are available with states. With these technologies, it has become easy for state to collect information about its citizens. (ii) Globalisation improves economical aspects. Economic policy of openness makes business flourish. The countries following these policies progress and prosper immensely. Negative effects of globalisation are as follows: (i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. (ii) Powerfully influenced by the American way of life, globalisation has given rise to the cultural pollution in many countries of the world. Q.7. Explain any four reasons for resistance to globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. Following are the reasons for the resistance to globalisation: (i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that make the rich richer and the poor poorer. (ii) Wea kening of the state leads to the reduction in the capacity of the state to protect the interests of its citizens, especially poor. (iii) Many countries also fear the weakening of state in political terms. Economically, they want a return to self-reliance and protectionism, at least in certain areas of the economy.

It would be a blunder to accept globalisation only as an economic, political or a cultural event. The impact of globalisation is vastly uneven— it affects some parts more than others. Q.5. Define globalisation. Explain any one criticism for globalisation. [CBSE Delhi (C) 2014]
 impact is felt outside their immediate local, national or regional environment at the international level. Q.2. What is global ‘mutual connection’? What are its components? [NCERT] Ans. Global mutual connection means the free flow of ideas, capital commodities and people from one part of the world to another. In present times, different parts of world have come close to each other. And its credit goes to the development of means of communication. The invention of telegraph, the telephone and the microchips has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. Printing connected people living at different corners of the globe. But Globalisation however does not emerge merely because of the availability of improved communications. But people in different partsof the world recognise that they are connected to each other. Currently, we are aware of the fact that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on another part of the world like Bird Flu or Tsunami. Q.3. How do technologies contribute in the direction of globalisation? Explain. [CBSE Delhi 2013, CBSE Delhi 2015] Or How has technology contributed to the globalisation? [NCERT] Ans. Revolution in Communication Technique: Technology remains a critical element. There is no doubt that the invention of telegraph, the telephone, and the microchip in more recent times has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. When printing initially came into being, it laid the basis for the creation of nationalism. Technology has affected us at individual and collective levels. Technological advancements have stimulated the transfer and movement of capital, thoughts, commodities and people from one part of the world to another and that too, easily. The movement of capital and commodities has been more than the movement of peoples across different parts of the world. Q.4. Why is globalisation a multidimensional concept? Ans. Globalisation is a multidimensional concept because it cannot be limited within a certain sphere. Its effect can be seen in all the sectors like economic, political and cultural. It would be a blunder to accept globalisation only as an economic, political or a cultural event. The impact of globalisation is vastly uneven— it affects some parts more than others. Q.5. Define globalisation. Explain any one criticism for globalisation. [CBSE Delhi (C) 2014]
 Ans.Globalisation means globalise the social relationship in such a manner that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on another part of the world. Thus globalisation is a process in which whole earth became a global village, in which socioeconomic contact is based on mutual corporation. Apart from the sphere of economics and politics, Globalisation has affected us culturally. What we eat, drink, think and wear reflect our culture. Imposition of Western Culture on the rest of the world is leading the world to homogenous culture. It is the result of US Hegemony. Cultures seeking to buy into the dominant American dream is dangerous not only for poor countries but also for the whole of humanity, for it might lead to the shinkage of the rich cultural heritage of the entire globe. Q.6. Clarify any two positive and any two negative effects of globalisation. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Ans. Two positive effects of globalisation are as follows: (i) As a consequence of globalisation, enhanced technologies are available with states. With these technologies, it has become easy for state to collect information about its citizens. (ii) Globalisation improves economical aspects. Economic policy of openness makes business flourish. The countries following these policies progress and prosper immensely. Negative effects of globalisation are as follows: (i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. (ii) Powerfully influenced by the American way of life, globalisation has given rise to the cultural pollution in many countries of the world. Q.7. Explain any four reasons for resistance to globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. Following are the reasons for the resistance to globalisation: (i) Globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that make the rich richer and the poor poorer. (ii) Wea kening of the state leads to the reduction in the capacity of the state to protect the interests of its citizens, especially poor. (iii) Many countries also fear the weakening of state in political terms. Economically, they want a return to self-reliance and protectionism, at least in certain areas of the economy.

 Q.1 What is globalisation? Enlighten any three reasons for globalisation. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Or Define globalisation. Explain any three reasons for globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans. Globalisation means globalise the social relationship in such a way that events taking place in some parts of the world could have an impact on another part of the world. Thus, globalisation is a process in which whole earth became a global village, in which socio-economic contact is based on mutual cooperation. Main reasons for Globalisation are as follows: 1. Revolution in Communication Technique: Technology remains a critical element. There is no doubt that the invention of telegraph, the telephone, and the microchip in more recent times has revolutionised communication between different parts of the world. When printing initially came into being, it laid the basis for the creation of nationalism. Technology has affected us at individual and collective levels. Technological advancements have stimulated the transfer and movement of capital, thoughts, commodities and people from one part of the world to another and that too, easily. The movement of capital and commodities has been more than the movement of peoples across different parts of the world. 2. Flow of Capital and Commodities: Economic concept of the world has to play an important role in world politics. The mention of economic globalisation draws our attention immediately to the role of international institutions like IMF and the WTO and the role they play in determining economic policies across the world. Yet globalisation must not be viewed in such narrow terms. Economic globalisation involves many factors other than these international institutions. A much broader way of understanding of economic globalisation require us to look at the distribution of economic gains, i.e., who get the most from globalisation and who gets less, indeed who loses from it. 3. Impact of an event on all the people of World: Globalisation, however, does not emerge merely because of the availability of improved communications. What is important is for people in different parts of the world is to recognise these interconnections with the rest of the world. Currently, we are aware of the fact that events taking place in one part of the world could have an impact on the another part of the world. The Bird Flu or Tsunami is not confined to any particular nation. It does not respect national boundaries. Similarly, when major economic events take place, their
 impact is felt outside their immediate local, national or regional environment at the international level. Q.2. What is global ‘mutual connection’? What are its components? [NCERT] Ans. Global mutual connection means the free flow of ideas, capital commodities and people from one part of the world to another. In present times, different parts of world have come close to each other.

The impact of globalisation is vastly uneven— it affects some parts more than others.","[CBSE (AI) 2011] Ans. Globalisation refers to create social relationship world wide in such a way that a small event in a different region affects the another event taking place in a far off region. Thus globalisation is a process in which the whole earth is termed as a ‘global village’ and socio-economic contacts are based on mutual cooperation.Globalisation is different from internationalisation: (i) Globalisation focuses to link its economy with that of other countries by liberalisation and adoption of new economic policy. It strictly opposes indifferent and trade obstacles. (ii) Globalisation focuses towards international brotherhood, international institution like—USSR, World Bank, human rights and problems related to environment along with cooperation at international level and to fight against terrorism by communication. Q.8. Explain two economic consequences of globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2014] Ans. Economic consequences are as follows: 1. The most economic consequences of economic globalisation is greater economic flows among different countries of the world. In economic globalisation, flow of capital, commodities and ideas take place at a very high speed. Globalisation has involved greater trade in commodities across the globe. Restrictions imposed by different countries on allowing the imports of other countries have been reduced, which has eased the expansion of trade at global level. Investment on capital has also become easy. Investors now can take more profit by investing in developing and economically backward countries. 2. Economic globalisation has created an intense division of opinion all over the world. Those who are concerned about social justice are worried about the extent of state withdrawal caused by processes of economic globalisation. They point out that it is likely to profit only a small section of the population while impoverishing those who are dependent on government for job and welfare (education, health, sanitation, etc.) They have emphasised the need to ensure institutional safeguards or creating ‘social safety nets’ to minimise the negative effects of the globalisation on those who are economically weak. Q.9. Explain any four political consequences of globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2014] Or Explain any two political consequences of Globalisation. [CBSE Delhi 2012] Ans.

(iii) The permanent members were not chosen through an election while nonpermanent members are elected by general assembly. Q.15. Though the UN has failed in preventing wars and related miseries, nations prefer its continuation. What makes the UN an indispensable organisation? [NCERT] Ans. Though the UN has failed in preventing wars and related miseries, nations prefer its continuation. Following are the reasons behind this thinking: 1. UN has failed in preventing small scale war. But the greatest success of UN lies in preventing the whole world from third world war which can destroy the human kind. 2. UN is the only international organisation in which 193 member countries are included. It provides a platform to discuss on issues like international peace, security, economy, social aspects with open minds. 3. It is the only platform where mutual differences are settled not by war but peacefully by filing a complaint against each other in UN security council. It has prohibited the use of chemicals and nuclear weapons.
 4. UN provides medical aid in emergency and loan from World Bank and IMF to backward countries. 5. Works on certain areas like – education, epidemic, health and terrorism which cannot be done without international cooperation. 6. Unipolar system is there in the world and US hegemony is seen in the world. UN can control US. It can hold a discussion between US and other countries on certain issues. UN, alongwith its member nations can react to US hegemony and actions. Q.16. ‘Reforming the UN means restructuring of the security council.’ Do you agree with this statement? Give arguments for or against this position. [NCERT] Ans. Security Council is an integral part of the United Nations. It acts as UN’s executive head. There are five permanent members and ten non-permanent members. America, Britain, China, France and Russia are its permanent members. The non-permanent members serve for only two years at a time. There are two ways to vote to take decision in Security council. In Procedural means, vote of atleast 9 members out of 15 members should be in favour of the proposal. While taking decisions related to military, finance or other important issues, all five permanent nations should agree in addition to the votes in favour of the proposal. In other words, the proposal does not pass if any one of the permanent member is not in its favour, irrespective of the number of votes came in its favour. This process of election in the security council is known as ‘veto’ power of the permanent-members of the UN. The Security Council is a powerful organistion of the UN. It can give directions to other countries to resolve conflicts between nations or can solve them by intervention, maintaining peace, law, order and security by resolving conflicts as it is the responsibility of the Security Council. If these peaceful ways do not work, then the Security Council adopts coercive method before war. It can even order the country found guilty to break trade-commerce-financial and diplomatic relations. If coercive method does not work, then military actions against the country found guilty, can also be taken. Reforms in structure of the Security Council can pave way for the UN’s improvement as the Security Council is the backbone of the UN. The structure of the Security Council is such that it plays role of a judge in all matters, so UN cannot be improved without structural reforms in the Security Council. Q.17. Although UN has failed to act as effective checks on the hegemony of US, nations prefer its continuation. Suggest any three suitable arguments to justify the relevance of UN in the post-cold war era. [CBSE Sample Paper 2016] Ans. Relevance of UN in the post-cold war period: (i) In the unipolar world, the UN can and has served to bring US and rest of the world into discussion on various issues.

It  provides loan and grants to the member countries. More poorer nation need not to pay that back. In this way, it exercises enormous influence on the economic policies of global economy.","Q.1. Describe the process of evolution of the UN. Or Describe the UN. Ans. The First World War encouraged the world to invest in an international organisation to deal with conflict. Many believed that such an organisation would help the world to avoid war. As a result, ‘League of Nations’ was established in 1920. But it could not succeed in its objectives. Second World war began on 1st September 1939. Many more people died and were wounded in this war than ever before. The UN was founded as a successor to the ‘League of Nations’. It was established in 1945, immediately after the second world war. The UN’s objective is to prevent international conflict and to facilitate cooperation among states. It was founded with the hope that it would act to stop the conflicts between states escalating into war and if war broke out, to limit the extent of hostilities. Furthermore, since conflicts often arose from lack of social and economic development, the UN was intended to bring countries together to improve the prospects of social and economic development all over the world. The organisation was set up with 51 founder members and by 2017, the UN had 193 members. These included almost all independent states. In the UN General Assembly, all members have one vote each. In the UN security council, there are five permanent members. These are: the United Sates, Russia, the United Kingdom, France and China. These states were selected as permanent members as they were the mostpowerful immediately after the second world war and because they constituted the victors in the wars.The UN’s representative head is the Secretary General. The present Secretary General is Antonio Guterres from Portugal. He is the ninth secretary General of the UN. The main organs of UN are as follows: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

 (vi) The UN has failed on multiple counts to protect individuals from genocide, disease and ensure peace such as in Rwandan genocide. Similarly, the UN needs to take a proactive role in climate change negotiations. Q.11. As a citizen of India how would you support India’s candidature for the permanent membership of the Security Council? Justify your proposal. [NCERT] Ans. India should gain permanent membership of the Security Council because of the following features of India: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.
 India is the second most populous country in the world. India is the largest democracy of the world. It is emerging as an Economic power at the International Frontier. India has participated in virtually all the initiatives of the UN. It’s role in the UN’s peacekeeping efforts is a long and substantial one. India is member of UN since beginning.
 Q.12. Why did India support membership of China in UN? Ans. When matter of China’s membership arose in UN, India stood in favour of China and got succeeded in making China a member of UN. Following are the reasons that motivated India to do so: 1. China has a huge population and excluding such a huge populous state from UN is not a wise move. 2. India wanted to strengthen its relation with China. 3. China’s geographical and political structure would help other member states of UN. 4. China’s fast progression in all the sectors in the past few decades, cannot be neglected. Q.13. Why was the need of improvement in UN felt and what were the parameters chosen for permanent and non-permanent membership of UN Security Council? Ans. After the end of cold war, the question facing the world was: Is UN doing enough or does it require reforms for better functioning?While the case of reform has widespread support, getting agreement on what to do is difficult. In 1992, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution. It has three basic elements which are as follows: 1. The Security Council no longer represents contemporary political realities. 2. Its decisions reflect only western values and interests and are dominated by a few powers. 3. It lacks equitable representation.

How was European Union established?,"Second World War shattered many of the assumptions and structures on which the European states had based their relations. In 1945, the European states confronted the ruin of their economies and the destruction of the assumptions and structures on which Europe had been founded, European integration after 1945 was aided by the Cold War. America extended massive financial help for reviving Europe’s economy under the ‘Marshall Plan’. The US also created a new collective security structure under NATO. Under the Marshall Plan, the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) was established in 1948 to channel aid to the west European states. The Councilof Europe, established in 1949, was another step forward in political cooperation. The process of economic integration of Western European countries led to the formation of European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957. This process acquired a political dimension with the creation of the European Parliament. The collapse of the Soviet bloc put Europe on a fast track and resulted in the establishment of the ‘European Union’ in 1992.","Q.1. How was European Union established? Ans.

Before and during the Second World War, south eastern region of Asia suffered the economical and political consequences of repeated colonialisms, both European and Japanese. At the end of the war, it confronted problems of nation building, the ravages of poverty and economic backwardness and the pressure to align with great poweror another during the cold war. This was the receipt for conflict, which the countries of southeast Asia could ill afford. Efforts at Asian and Third World Unity, such as the Bandung conference and the Non-Aligned Movement were ineffective in establishing the conventions for informal cooperation and interaction. Hence, the Southeast Asian nations sought an alternative by establishing the Association for southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN was established in 1967 by five countries of this region – Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand – by signing the ‘Bangkok Declaration’. Q.3. Write any four features of ASEAN. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. (i) ASEAN countries adopted a form of interaction, that is informal, nonconfrontationist, and cooperative. This was known as ‘ASEAN way’.

America thinks that safety and peace is essential in the region as there is a hugepopulation and huge market in South Asia. Q.11. Why were superpowers more interested in South Asian countries during the Cold War era? How did this affect the region? Ans. South Asia is the region where lots of internal affairs and global struggles exist. American involvement in South Asia rapidly increased after the cold war because this region could provide ports against its enemies - Soviet Union and China. America looked towards India but since India became a member of non-aligned movement, it headed towards Pakistan. A series of issues arose in this region. Issues like boundary affairs and distribution of river waters have made this region unrest. The fact that the region can develop if the countries cooperate with each other was observed by citizens of these countries. Q.12. Why did India interfere in the affair of East Pakistan? Ans. After independence, people of East Pakistan resented the domination of Western Pakistan and the imposition of the Urdu language. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led the popular struggle against West Pakistani domination. They demanded autonomy for the eastern region. In 1970, national assembly elections were held in Pakistan. The Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur won all the seats in East Pakistan and secured a majority (313 out of 167) is proposed constituent assembly for the whole of Pakistan. But the government dominated by the West Pakistani leadership refused to convene the assembly. Sheikh Mujibur was arrested. Under the military rule of General YahyaKhan, the Pakistan army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. Thousands were killed by the Pakistani army. This led to a large scale migration into India, creating a huge refugee problem for India. The government of India supported the demand of the people of East Pakistan for independence and helped them financially and militarily. This resulted in a war between India and Pakistan in December 1971 that ended in the surrender of the Pakistani forces in East Pakistan and the formation of ‘Bangladesh’ as an independent country. Q.13. Why did India had to call back its army from Sri Lanka? Ans. There was a considerable pressure from Tamil people in India to effect that the Indian government should protect the interests of the Tamils in Sri Lanka. On 29 July, 1987, India signed an accord with Sri Lanka in which provincial councils in northern and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka were formed and provincial autonomy to them was given. The aim of the agreement was to save interests of Tamil and their identity by maintaining sovereignty of Sri Lanka. It was also decided that ‘Tamil Tigers’ would end the struggle and give up their weapons. But the agreement could not be implemented completely. Sri Lanka said India to sent military troops in order to establish peace in north-eastern states of country. Indian military troops tried to establish peace in Sri Lanka with the help of Sri Lankan government. Eventually, the Indian army got into a

How did new world order start?,"It is believed that new world order started in December 1991 after the disintegration of Soviet Union and the hegemony of US was established in this new economy.

The dominance of US can be seen on Dunbarton Oaks, Yalta Conference, San Francisco conference and Potsdam conference. This is also true that from the establishment of UN in 24 October, 1945, US hegemony is still existing on this world organization. It has also played an important role in decisionmaking of UN over various problems of Korea, Congo, Vietnam, Cyprus, Philistine, Kashmir, etc. It was appropriately said by scholar that the world affairs were depicted under the leadership of Britain.

Q.5. Give a brief description of Iraq War. Ans. US, in regard to destruction of 9/11, concentrated on Iraq after defeating Afghanistan. The news was spreaded in the world that Iraq’s President has an illegal collection of weapons of mass destruction.

On 19 March 2003, the US launched its invasion of Iraq under the codename ‘operation Iraqi freedom’. Even UN’s permission was not taken for this invasion. The government of Saddam Hussein fell swiftly. Since no evidence of WMD has been unearthed in Iraq, it is speculated that the invasion was motivated by other objectives, such as controlling Iraqi oilfields and installing a regime friendly to the US. Even after winning, US has not been able to ‘pacify’ Iraq. Instead, a full-fledged insurgencies against US Occupation was ignited in Iraq. While the US has lost over 3,000 military personnel in the war, Iraqi casualties are very much higher. 50,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed in the US-led invasion. Q.6. Write a short note on ‘First Gulf War’. Ans. The ‘First Gulf War’ revealed the vast technological gap that had opened up between the US military capability and that of other states. The highly publicised use of socalled ‘smart bombs’ by the US led observers to call this a ‘computer war’. Widespread television coverage also made it as ‘video game war’, with viewers around the worldwatching the destruction of Iraqi forces live on TV in the comfort of their living rooms. Incredibly, the US may actually have made a profit from the war. The US received more money from countries like Germany, Japan and Saudi Arabia that it had spent on the war.

History tells us that empires decline because they decay from within. Similarly the biggest constraints to American hegemony lie within the heart of hegemony itself. Although, none of these constraints seemed to operate in the years following 9/11, but it now appears that all three of these constraints are slowly beginning to operate again. These are as follows: (i) Institutional Architecture of America: The first constraint is the institutional architecture of America itself. A system of division of powers between the three branches of the government, places significant breaks upon the unrestrained and immoderate exercise of America’s military power of the executive branch. This isthe best example of constraints on American hegemony today. (ii) Domestic Nature of American Power: The second constraint on American hegemony is internal and domestic nature of American power. Although the American mass media may from time to time impose or promote a particular perspective on domestic public opinion in the US, there is nevertheless a deep skepticism regarding the purposes and methods of government in American political culture. This factor is a huge constraint on US military action overseas.

Q.9. Describe US hegemony as a soft power. [CBSE (AI) 2014] Or ‘US’s hegemony as a soft power cannot be denied.’ Comment. Ans. After the Second World War, America’s cultural superiority along with military and soft power dominance can also be seen. Here, hegemony implies class ascendancy in the social, political and particularly ideological spheres. Hegemony arises when the dominant country can win the consent of dominated classes, by persuading the dominated classes to view the world in a manner favourable to the ascendancy of the dominant class. A dominant power deploys notonly military power but also ideological resources to shape the behavior of competing and lesser powers. Consent, in other words, goes hand-in-hand with, and often more effective than, coercion. The predominance of the US in the world today is based not only on its military power and economic powers, but also on its cultural presence. India’s example can justify this. It is the dream of every literate Indian that he/she wants to go settle in US by any means because they feel their future is secured in US. India is adopting culture, living sense of US. US has been benefitted by this reaction is expanding its dominance. Even during the Cold War, the society of Soviet Union was very much impressed by the improvised of US. The youth of Soviet Union was most impressed by wearing the popular blue jeans. As a result, they used to feel satisfied after purchasing blue jeans from market ever if they spend their yearly income. These blue jeans were not available in their own country. During the Cold War, the US found it difficult to score victories against the Soviet Union in the realm of hard power. It was in the area of structural power and soft power that the US scored notable victories. The interest of citizens of Soviet Union in blue jeans clearly shows this. The US culture is very attractive and is most powerful. It is that aspect of soft power where the country wins the consent of dominated classes.

List challenges to democracy in Pakistan. ,"There are several challenges to democracy in Pakistan. The social dominance of the military, clergy and landowning aristocracy has led to the frequent overthrow of elected governments and the establishment of military government. Pakistan’s conflict with India has made the pro-military groups more powerful. These groups have often said that political parties and democracy in Pakistan are flawed, that Pakistan’s security would be harmed by selfish-minded parties and chaotic democracy, and that the army’s stay in power is justified while democracy has not been completely successful in Pakistan, there has been a strong pro-democracy sentiment in the country, Pakistan has a courageous and relatively free press and a strong human rights movement.","Q.1. Describe any two major issues between India and Pakistan which led to war of 1971. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. War of 1971 held because of two main reasons: (i) Refugee problem in 1971: A disintegrated Pakistan came in elections of 1970. Parties of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Sheikh Mujibur succeeded in Western and Eastern Pakistan respectively. Bengali population of eastern Pakistan voted heavily against Western Pakistan. Rulers of Western Pakistan considered citizens of eastern Pakistan as ‘another level’ citizens. Pakistan didn’t consider decision of democracy taken by eastern Pakistan valid. They also refused to convene the assembly of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Sheikh Mujibur was arrested and Pakistani army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. This led to a large scale migration into India, creating a huge refugee problem in India. The government of India supported people of east Pakistan. Consequently, India had a war with Pakistan. (ii) To support Bangladesh for its independence: In 1971, people of eastern Pakistan resented the domination of Western Pakistan and the imposition of an Urdu language. Thousands were killed by the Pakistani army which led to huge scale migration into India. India too gave them shelter. In addition to this, India support Bangladesh in its struggle for independence. Pakistan strongly opposed this step of India and attacked on its airports on 3 December, 1971. Indian army too attacked Pakistan. Pakistan lost the war which resulted in the transformation of eastern Pakistan into newly independent country ‘Bangladesh’. Q.2. ‘Pakistan has witnessed both civilian and democratic system’. Explain. Ans. Pakistan has witnessed civilian system many times despite of citizens aspiration for democracy. In last 65 years, almost 29-30 years were ruled by civilians in Pakistan from 1947 to 2012. General Ayub Khan, General Yahya, General Zia-ul-Haq and General Pervez Musharraf were among the leaders of civil-rule. The first military rule inPakistan was established under the leadership of General Ayub Khan and was succeeded in announcing constitution ruler of Pakistan through the drama of elections. But he couldn’t befool public and public outrage increased. Unstability and dissatisfaction against him was increasing in Pakistan army. General Yahya took advantage, overthrew the government and himself became the dictator. Separation of eastern part of Pakistan and Pakistan’s defeat from India banished Yahya Khan from his power and an elected government under the leadership of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto came into power. Within the period of 7 years, Bhutto government was removed by General Zia-ul-Haq by a military revolution and was hanged after sometime.Dissatisfaction
 towards military rule of General Zia-ul-Haq and democratic government under the leadership of Benezir Bhutto, daughter of Bhutto was established in Pakistan. According to the structure of political democratic structure of Pakistan from 1988 to 1999, Benezir Bhutto’s government centered around Pakistan People’s Party and Muslim league of Nawaz Sharif. In starting of 1999, military under leadership of General Parvez Musharraf overthrew government of Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister of Pakistan and was dismissed from Pakistan. General Musharraf got himself elected as the President. Announcement of emergency in Pakistan was done in the last months of 2006. Elections were planned on 8 January 2008 but were postponed due to death of Benezir Bhutto during campaigning. Recently, ordinary elections took place in Pakistan, where Pakistan Muslim League (PML) was formed and Nawaz Sharif was elected as Prime Minister. Q.3.

The reasons behind unstable democracy in Pakistan are as follows: (i) The social dominance of the military, clergy and landowning aristocracy has led to the frequent overthrow of elected governments and the establishment of military government. Pakistan’s conflict with India has made the pro-military groups more powerful. These groups have often said that political parties and democracy inPakistan are flawed, that Pakistan’s security would be harmed by selfish-minded parties and chaotic democracy, and that army’s stay in power, is therefore, justified. While democracy has not been fully successful in Pakistan, there has been a strong prodemocracy sentiment in the country. (ii) Pakistan has a courageous and relatively free press and a strong human rights movement. The lack of genuine international support for its democratic rule in Pakistan has further encouraged the military to continue its dominance. The United States and other western countries have encouraged the military’s authoritarian rule in the past, for their own reasons. Given the fact that the threat of what they call as ‘Global Islamic Terrorism’ and the apprehension that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal might fall into the hands of these terrorist groups, the military regime in Pakistan has been seen as the protector of Western interests in West Asia and South Asia. Q.4. Explain any three factors that are responsible for the failure of building a stable democratic rule in Pakistan. Ans. The factors responsible for the failure of building a stable democratic rule in Pakistanare as follows: 1.

","the Awami league led by Shiekh Mujib won all seats in East Pakistan and secured majority in the proposed constituent assembly for the whole of Pakistan. But the government dominated by the West Pakistan refused to convene the assembly. 4. Shiekh Mujib was arrested and under the military rule of General Yahya Khan, the Pakistani army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. This led to a large scale migration into India, creating huge refugee problem for India. 5. The government of India supported the demands of the people of east Pakistan for their Independence and helped them financially and militarily. 6. This resulted in a war between India and Pakistan in December 1971 that ended in the formation of Bangladesh as an independent nation. Q.9. Give a description of India-Sri Lanka relationship by describing ethnic conflicts of Sri Lanka. Ans. Sri Lanka is a small island located at South of India. Like India, Sri Lanka has successfully operated a democratic system since their independence from the British. But lives of the citizens have become bothersome due to ethnic conflicts. Sri Lanka has majority of Sri Lankan natives called ‘Sinhalas’. But a large number of Tamils, who had migrated from India to Sri Lanka are also settled there. They live mainly at Northeastern parts of Sri Lanka. The migration continued even after the independence. Majority of country, i.e., Sinhalas do not like Tamils living in Sri Lanka. They believe that Sri Lanka belongs to Sinhalas only. In 1964, ‘Shastri-Sinimavo Bandaranaike agreement’ was signed to solve the problem concerning Indian Tamils but that couldn’t be implemented properly.After some years, left wing extremists revolted against government in Sri Lanka and government was busy in suppressing them. The neglect and hatred of Tamil by Sinhalas led to fights. Violent fights took place between both communities in 1983. Sri Lankan army suppressed Tamils heartlessly. A serious reaction was seen on Tamilians. The ‘Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam’ (LTTE) was formed and demanded ‘Tamil Eelam’ or a separate country for the Tamils of SriLanka. Firing by aeroplanes in order to destroy Tamil’s military base by Sri Lankan government further worsened the situation. Pressure was put on Tamil Nadu government by Tamils to take measures in the direction of saving their interests and security. The difficulties in the relationship between the governments of India and Sri Lanka are mostly over ethnic conflict in the island nation. Indian leaders and citizens find it impossible to remain neutral when Tamils are politically unhappy and are being killed. After the military intervention in 1987, the Indian government now prefers a policy of disengagement visà-vis Sri Lanka’s internal troubles. India signed a free trade agreement with Sri Lanka, which strengthened relations between two-countries. India’s help in post-tsunami reconstruction in Sri Lanka has also brought the two countries closer. Q.10. Describe important issues or struggles held between India and Pakistan. Ans. Following struggles have taken place between India and Pakistan:
 growing interest of America. America does not want Nepal to go under the influence of China, after Tibet. This applies to India as well. Q.7. Why did citizens of East Pakistan revolt against West Pakistan? Ans. The people of East Pakistan resented the domination of Western Pakistan and the imposition of the Urdu language. Soon after the partition, they began protests against the unfair treatment meted out to the Bengali culture and language. They also demanded fair representation in administration and a fair share in political power. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led the popular struggle against West Pakistan domination. He demanded autonomy for the eastern region. Q.8. How did India clear the doubts of other countries of South Asia regarding SAFTA? Ans. India has allowed trading of the products made by other countries of South Asia without paying any trade tariffs. This was announced in SAARC summit organised at Delhi on April 2007. India thinks that free trade across the borders of countries of South Asia would increase trade relations (according to SAFTA) and formation of a free trade zone would increase political cooperation. India has bilateral agreements with Nepal and Sri Lanka. Q.9. What were the challenges faced by Sri Lanka after independence? Ans. Sri Lanka had to face challenge from ethnic conflict after independence. Sri Lanka was dominated by the forces that represented the interest of the majority of Sinhala community. They were hostile to a large number of Tamils who had migrated from India to Sri Lanka and settled there. This migration continued even after the independence.They were only 19 per cent of the total population. The Sinhala nationalists thought that Sri Lanka should not give ‘concessions’ to the Tamils. The neglect of Tamil concerns led to militant Tamil nationalism for interests of culture, language and identity. Q.10. How are the external powers influencing bilateral relations in South Asia? [NCERT] Ans. South Asia has been under the influence of external powers due to its natural formation. India adopted the policy of non-alignment during the cold war but Pakistan became a member of NATO, thus affecting India-Pakistan relations and leading to conflicts and tensions. Pakistan supported terrorist activities in India with the assistance given by America. China and USA play an important role in politics of South Asia. IndiaChina relations became bitter on issues of Tibet crises and McMohan line. Chinese support to Pakistan was one of the reasons for bitterness in their relations. In recent years, India-China economic relations have improved. American coherence has been increased in this region from the end of Cold War. America has tried to maintain cordial relationship with India and Pakistan. Economic development, globalisation and
 liberalisation have increased the role of America in this region. America thinks that safety and peace is essential in the region as there is a hugepopulation and huge market in South Asia. Q.11. Why were superpowers more interested in South Asian countries during the Cold War era? How did this affect the region? Ans. South Asia is the region where lots of internal affairs and global struggles exist. American involvement in South Asia rapidly increased after the cold war because this region could provide ports against its enemies - Soviet Union and China. America looked towards India but since India became a member of non-aligned movement, it headed towards Pakistan. A series of issues arose in this region. Issues like boundary affairs and distribution of river waters have made this region unrest. The fact that the region can develop if the countries cooperate with each other was observed by citizens of these countries. Q.12. Why did India interfere in the affair of East Pakistan? Ans. After independence, people of East Pakistan resented the domination of Western Pakistan and the imposition of the Urdu language. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led the popular struggle against West Pakistani domination. They demanded autonomy for the eastern region. In 1970, national assembly elections were held in Pakistan. The Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur won all the seats in East Pakistan and secured a majority (313 out of 167) is proposed constituent assembly for the whole of Pakistan. But the government dominated by the West Pakistani leadership refused to convene the assembly. Sheikh Mujibur was arrested. Under the military rule of General YahyaKhan, the Pakistan army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. Thousands were killed by the Pakistani army. This led to a large scale migration into India, creating a huge refugee problem for India. The government of India supported the demand of the people of East Pakistan for independence and helped them financially and militarily. This resulted in a war between India and Pakistan in December 1971 that ended in the surrender of the Pakistani forces in East Pakistan and the formation of ‘Bangladesh’ as an independent country. Q.13. Why did India had to call back its army from Sri Lanka? Ans. There was a considerable pressure from Tamil people in India to effect that the Indian government should protect the interests of the Tamils in Sri Lanka. On 29 July, 1987, India signed an accord with Sri Lanka in which provincial councils in northern and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka were formed and provincial autonomy to them was given. The aim of the agreement was to save interests of Tamil and their identity by maintaining sovereignty of Sri Lanka. It was also decided that ‘Tamil Tigers’ would end the struggle and give up their weapons. But the agreement could not be implemented completely. Sri Lanka said India to sent military troops in order to establish peace in north-eastern states of country. Indian military troops tried to establish peace in Sri Lanka with the help of Sri Lankan government. Eventually, the Indian army got into a
 fight with LTTE. Shri Premdas became Presidentof Sri Lanka. He was completely against the presence of Indian army in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan citizens saw this as an India’s attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka. Indian Tamils were also unhappy with the proceedings being done against them (Sri Lankan Tamilians) by India. Sri Lankan President Premdasa openly demanded India to take back its armed forces on 29 July, 1989. Uncertainty and strain continued for some time in Sri Lanka. But in December 1989, after the formation of new government, Indian Peace Keeping Force was called back from Sri Lanka on 31 March, 1990. Q.14. What steps have been taken to normalise Indo-Pak relations by Indian rulers in last two decades? Ans. Pakistan’s support to terrorism in Kashmir still continues. Despite of this, Prime Minister Gujral tried to improve bilateral relations. Prime Minister Vajpayee did Lahore Bus Tour and signed Lahore announcement letter in order to promote harmony. In return to this, kargil war was held between both the countries as an undisclosed war. Agra-talks of 2001 failed and terrorist attack on Parliament in December 2001 inspired India to end all diplomatic relations with Pakistan. Pakistan’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) is alleged to be involved in managing in Anti-Indian campaigns. Diplomatic initiatives were again started in 2003 but this was a pain staking way and both the countries were heading for friendly solution carefully. This pause was broken down by Vajpayee’s visit to Islamabad and to start cricket between both countries again. A Re-evaluation of relationship of both the countries was proposed by Manmohan Singh (former Prime Minister of India). Hindrance was seen during Mumbai bomb blast in 2006 but both countries agreed to continue discussion. SAARC summit held at New Delhi 2007 paved way for peace and friendliness in this area between both the countries. They accepted that terrorisom is a challenge in the way of peace and security. When Pakistani Prime Minister visited India in 2014, people of both the countries hoped for a fresh start and improved relations. But Pakistan’s irresponsible attitude towards terrorism cannot be trusted upon. It agrees on eliminating terrorism but does not take any initiative. Instead, it promotes terrorism. Q.15. Mention some of the recent agreements between India and Pakistan. [NCERT] Ans. Although India-Pakistan relations seem revolving around conflicts, there have been a series of efforts to manage tensions and build peace. Following are the recent agreements between them: 1. India-Pakistan held differences over distribution of Indus river waters. Indus River Treaty was signed by India and Pakistan in 1960 by mediation of World Bank. Despite of the differences, the treaty is still in effect. 2. After Indo-Pak war of 1971, Shimla pact was signed by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Indira Gandhi.

","Q.1. Describe any two major issues between India and Pakistan which led to war of 1971. [CBSE Delhi 2013] Ans. War of 1971 held because of two main reasons: (i) Refugee problem in 1971: A disintegrated Pakistan came in elections of 1970. Parties of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Sheikh Mujibur succeeded in Western and Eastern Pakistan respectively. Bengali population of eastern Pakistan voted heavily against Western Pakistan. Rulers of Western Pakistan considered citizens of eastern Pakistan as ‘another level’ citizens. Pakistan didn’t consider decision of democracy taken by eastern Pakistan valid. They also refused to convene the assembly of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Sheikh Mujibur was arrested and Pakistani army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. This led to a large scale migration into India, creating a huge refugee problem in India. The government of India supported people of east Pakistan. Consequently, India had a war with Pakistan. (ii) To support Bangladesh for its independence: In 1971, people of eastern Pakistan resented the domination of Western Pakistan and the imposition of an Urdu language. Thousands were killed by the Pakistani army which led to huge scale migration into India. India too gave them shelter. In addition to this, India support Bangladesh in its struggle for independence. Pakistan strongly opposed this step of India and attacked on its airports on 3 December, 1971. Indian army too attacked Pakistan. Pakistan lost the war which resulted in the transformation of eastern Pakistan into newly independent country ‘Bangladesh’. Q.2. ‘Pakistan has witnessed both civilian and democratic system’. Explain. Ans. Pakistan has witnessed civilian system many times despite of citizens aspiration for democracy. In last 65 years, almost 29-30 years were ruled by civilians in Pakistan from 1947 to 2012. General Ayub Khan, General Yahya, General Zia-ul-Haq and General Pervez Musharraf were among the leaders of civil-rule. The first military rule inPakistan was established under the leadership of General Ayub Khan and was succeeded in announcing constitution ruler of Pakistan through the drama of elections. But he couldn’t befool public and public outrage increased. Unstability and dissatisfaction against him was increasing in Pakistan army. General Yahya took advantage, overthrew the government and himself became the dictator. Separation of eastern part of Pakistan and Pakistan’s defeat from India banished Yahya Khan from his power and an elected government under the leadership of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto came into power. Within the period of 7 years, Bhutto government was removed by General Zia-ul-Haq by a military revolution and was hanged after sometime.Dissatisfaction
 towards military rule of General Zia-ul-Haq and democratic government under the leadership of Benezir Bhutto, daughter of Bhutto was established in Pakistan. According to the structure of political democratic structure of Pakistan from 1988 to 1999, Benezir Bhutto’s government centered around Pakistan People’s Party and Muslim league of Nawaz Sharif. In starting of 1999, military under leadership of General Parvez Musharraf overthrew government of Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister of Pakistan and was dismissed from Pakistan. General Musharraf got himself elected as the President. Announcement of emergency in Pakistan was done in the last months of 2006. Elections were planned on 8 January 2008 but were postponed due to death of Benezir Bhutto during campaigning. Recently, ordinary elections took place in Pakistan, where Pakistan Muslim League (PML) was formed and Nawaz Sharif was elected as Prime Minister. Q.3. Even after sharing a same history, why roots of democracy could not be strengthened in Pakistan as they are in India? [CBSE (AI) 2011] Ans. The reasons behind unstable democracy in Pakistan are as follows: (i) The social dominance of the military, clergy and landowning aristocracy has led to the frequent overthrow of elected governments and the establishment of military government. Pakistan’s conflict with India has made the pro-military groups more powerful. These groups have often said that political parties and democracy inPakistan are flawed, that Pakistan’s security would be harmed by selfish-minded parties and chaotic democracy, and that army’s stay in power, is therefore, justified. While democracy has not been fully successful in Pakistan, there has been a strong prodemocracy sentiment in the country. (ii) Pakistan has a courageous and relatively free press and a strong human rights movement. The lack of genuine international support for its democratic rule in Pakistan has further encouraged the military to continue its dominance. The United States and other western countries have encouraged the military’s authoritarian rule in the past, for their own reasons. Given the fact that the threat of what they call as ‘Global Islamic Terrorism’ and the apprehension that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal might fall into the hands of these terrorist groups, the military regime in Pakistan has been seen as the protector of Western interests in West Asia and South Asia. Q.4. Explain any three factors that are responsible for the failure of building a stable democratic rule in Pakistan. Ans. The factors responsible for the failure of building a stable democratic rule in Pakistanare as follows: 1. The social dominance of the military, clergy and landowning aristocracy has led to frequent overthrow of elected governments and establishment of military governments.

The United Nations Conference and Trade and Development  (UNCTAD) brought out a report in 1972 entitled. ‘Towards a New Trade Policy for Development’. The report proposed a reform of the global trading system. It aimed to: (i) Give the LDCs control over their natural resources exploited by the developed western countries. (ii) Obtain access to western markets so that the LDCs could sell their products and, therefore, mark trade more beneficial for the poorer countries. (iii) Reduce the cost of technology from the western countries and (iv) Provide the LDCs with a greater role in international economic institutions.","(iii) Strategic Arms Limitation Talks-II (SALT-II): After the above treaties came into force, second round was started immediately between the two superpowers.

The United Nation Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) brought out a report in 1972 entitled ‘Towards a New Trade Policy for development’. The report proposed a reform of the global trading system so as:
 1. Give the LDCs control over their natural resources exploited by the developed western nations. 2. Obtain access to the western markets so that the LDCs could sell their products and therefore make trade more beneficial for the poorer countries. 3. Reduce the cost of technology from western countries. 4. Provide the LDCs with a greater role in international economic institutions. Gradually, the nature of non-alignment changed to greater importance to economic issues. In 1961, at the first summit in Belgrade, economic issues had not been very important. The fourth summit was held at Algiers in 1972 in which 72 countries participated. In this summit, due to demand for the formation of NIEO, NAM became an ‘economic pressure group’. Further summits were held at Havana (1979), New Delhi (1986), Belgrade (1989), Cartagena (1995), Kuala Lumpur (2003) and then again at Havana (2006) aimed at north-south convention based on equality and fairness. However, by the late 1980s, NIEO’s initiative started to fade because of the developed countries, who acted as a united group against. This occurred with the aim to maintain unity among nonaligned countries due to stiff opposition of developed countries.
