"Ravi was studying in the city. In holidays he went to his village. There his father took him to his fields. He saw that the field crops were infested by insects, pests, diseases and weeds. His father was very worried. Ravi told his father what measures to be taken to protect the crop from these.  How do weeds affect the crop ?  Name any two weeds.  List any two aspects of Ravi’s behaviours that are worth appreciation here. "," Weeds damage the crops by retarding their growth. They compete with the main crop for air, water and other available nutrition.  Xanthium, Cyperinus rotundus.  Vigilance and awareness.","15.1.3 CROP PROTECTION MANAGEMENT Field crops are infested by a large number of weeds, insect pests and diseases. If weeds and pests are not controlled at the appropriate time then they can damage the crops so much that most of the crop is lost. Weeds are unwanted plants in the cultivated field, for example, Xanthium
 (gokhroo), Parthenium (gajar ghas), Cyperinus rotundus (motha). They compete for food, space and light. Weeds take up nutrients and reduce the growth of the crop. Therefore, removal of weeds from cultivated fields during the early stages of crop growth is essential for a good harvest. Generally insect pests attack the plants in three ways: (i) they cut the root, stem and leaf, (ii) they suck the cell sap from various parts of the plant, and (iii) they bore into stem and fruits. They thus affect the health of the crop and reduce yields. Diseases in plants are caused by pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and viruses. These pathogens can be present in and transmitted through the soil, water and air. Weeds, insects and diseases can be controlled by various methods. One of the most commonly used methods is the use of pesticides, which include herbicides, insecticides and fungicides. These chemicals are sprayed on crop plants or used for treating seeds and soil. However, excessive use of these chemicals creates problems, since they can be poisonous to many plant and animal species and cause environmental pollution. Weed control methods also include mechanical removal. Preventive methods such as proper seed bed preparation, timely sowing of crops, intercropping and crop rotation also help in weed control. Some other preventive measures against pests are the use of resistant varieties, and summer ploughing, in which fields are ploughed deep in summers to destroy weeds and pests.

Teacher mentioned about the organisms which enrich the soil with nutrients. Rahila was curious to know more about them. So she searched internet and came to know about Rhizobium bacteria and cyanobacteria.  What are bio-fertilizers ?  Explain how any one of the organism mention above enrich the soil with nutrients.  Why Rahila information? was curious to get more ," Biofertilizers are the substances containing living micro-organisms that add nutrients to the soil making it fertile. e.g., Rhizobium.  When applied to seeds soil or plants, it colonizes the interior of the plant and promotes growth by increasing the availability of nutrients to the plant.  Rahila was curious to know more about these particular organism and their mechanism.","Deficiency of these nutrients affects physiological processes in plants including reproduction, growth and susceptibility to diseases. To increase the yield, the soil can be enriched by supplying these nutrients in the form of manure and fertilizers.
 Q
 uestions 1. What are macro-nutrients and why are they called macronutrients? 2. How do plants get nutrients?
 FERTILIZERS Fertilizers are commercially produced plant nutrients. Fertilizers supply nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. They are used to ensure good vegetative growth (leaves, branches and flowers), giving rise to healthy plants. Fertilizers are a factor in the higher yields of high-cost farming. Fertilizers should be applied carefully in terms of proper dose, time, and observing preand post-application precautions for their complete utilisation. For example, sometimes fertilizers get washed away due to excessive irrigation and are not fully absorbed by the plants. This excess fertilizer then leads to water pollution. Also, as we have seen in the previous chapter, continuous use of fertilizers in an area can destroy soil fertility because the organic matter in the soil is not replenished and micro-organisms in the soil are harmed by the fertilizers used.

"A student visited a fish farm where he found Catla, Rohu, Mrigals, Common Carps and Grass Carps cultured in the same pond.  Name the type of fish farming observed by the student.  Mention the advantages of such a farming system.  What is the main problem in such a form of fish farming ? How do farmers overcome such problems ?"," Composite fish culture.  In such a system, a combination of five or six fish species is bred in a single fish pond. These species are selected so that they do not compete for food among them. As a result, food available in all parts of the pond is used. This increases the fish yield from the pond.  Most of the fish breed in monsoon only and even if fish seed is collected from wild it can be mixed with other species as well. So major problem is lack of availability of good food. This problem can be overcomed by breeding these fishes using hormonal stimulation.","As marine fish stocks get further depleted, the demand for more fish can only be met by such culture fisheries, a practice called mariculture.
 15.2.3 (ii) INLAND FISHERIES Fresh water resources include canals, ponds, reservoirs and rivers. Brackish water resources, where seawater and fresh water mix together, such as estuaries and lagoons are also important fish reservoirs. While capture fishing is also done in such inland water bodies, the yield is not high. Most fish production from these resources is through aquaculture. Fish culture is sometimes done in combination with a rice crop, so that fish are grown in the water in the paddy field. More intensive fish farming can be done in composite fish culture systems. Both local and imported fish species are used in such systems.

 One problem with such composite fish culture is that many of these fish breed only during monsoon. Even if fish seed is collected from the wild, it can be mixed with that of other species as well. So, a major problem in fish farming is the lack of availability of goodquality seed. To overcome this problem, ways have now been worked out to breed these fish in ponds using hormonal stimulation. This has ensured the supply of pure fish seed in desired quantities.

What alternative method did she suggest her father for this ?," Harmful Effects of Pesticides : 		 Pesticides are chemicals that cannot be decomposed by microbes or humans. So, when the crops sprayed by pesticides are consumed by humans, they get stored in their system and create problems for them. 		 Pesticides are also poisonous for some plants. This affects the plant growth and plant yield. 		 Pesticides should be used in appropriate quantities. Large amounts can be very problematic. 		 Pesticides cause environmental pollution.

Farmer ‘X’ planted Soyabean + Maize + Cowpeas in the same field simultaneously in a set row pattern. Farmer ‘Y’ planted cereal crop in one season and leguminous plants in next season on the same piece of land in preplanned succession.  Name the cropping pattern used by farmers ‘X’ and ‘Y’.  State two advantages of different cropping patterns followed by farmers ‘X’ and ‘Y’ respectively., X – Inter-cropping pattern. Y – Crop rotation.  Inter-cropping ensures maximum utilization of the nutrients supplied and prevents pests and diseases from spreading to all plants belonging to one crop. Crop rotation replenishes soil with different nutrients. Two or three crops can be grown in a year with good harvests.,"Inter-cropping is growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same field in a definite pattern (Fig.15.2). A few rows of one crop alternate with a few rows of a second crop, for example, soyabean + maize, or finger millet (bajra) + cowpea (lobia). The crops are selected such that their nutrient requirements are different. This ensures maximum utilisation of the nutrients supplied, and also prevents pests and diseases from spreading to all the plants belonging to one crop in a field. This way, both crops can give better returns.
 Fig. 15.2 : Intercropping
 The growing of different crops on a piece of land in a pre-planned succession is known as crop rotation. Depending upon the duration, crop rotation is done for different crop combinations. The availability of moisture and irrigation facilities decide the choice of the crop to be cultivated after one harvest. If crop rotation is done properly then two or three crops can be grown in a year with good harvests.

Food supplies proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals, all of which we require for body development, growth and health. Both plants and animals are major sources of food for us. We obtain most of this food from agriculture and animal husbandry. We read in newspapers that efforts are always being made to improve production from agriculture and animal husbandry. Why is this necessary? Why we cannot make do with the current levels of production? India is a very populous country. Our population is more than one billion people, and it is still growing. As food for this growing population, we will soon need more than a quarter of a billion tonnes of grain every year. This can be done by farming on more land. But India is already intensively cultivated. As a result, we do not have any major scope for increasing the area of land under cultivation. Therefore, it is necessary to increase our production efficiency for both crops and livestock. Efforts to meet the food demand by increasing food production have led to some successes so far. We have had the green revolution, which contributed to increased food-grain production. We have also had the white revolution, which has led to better and more efficient use as well as availability of milk. However, these revolutions mean that our natural resources are getting used more intensively. As a result, there are more chances of causing damage to our natural resources to the point of destroying their balance completely. Therefore, it is important that we should increase food production without degrading our environment and disturbing the balances maintaining it.

 Hence, there is a need for sustainable practices in agriculture and animal husbandry. Also, simply increasing grain production for storage in warehouses cannot solve the problem of malnutrition and hunger. People should have money to purchase food. Food security depends on both availability of food and access to it. The majority of our population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. Increasing the incomes of people working in agriculture is therefore necessary to combat the problem of hunger. Scientific management practices should be undertaken to obtain high yields from far ms. For sustained livelihood, one should undertake mixed farming, intercropping, and integrated farming practices, for example, combine agriculture with livestock/poultry/fisheries/ bee-keeping. The question thus becomes – how do we increase the yields of crops and livestock?

 Organic farming is a farming system with minimal or no use of chemicals as fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides etc. and with a maximum input of organic manures, recyled farm wastes, and bio-agents, with healthy cropping systems. Mixed farming is a system of farming on a particular farm which includes crop production, raising of livestock etc. Mixed cropping is growing of two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land. Growing two or more crops in definite row patterns is known as inter-cropping. The growing of different crops on a piece of land in pre-planned succession is called crop rotation. Varietal improvement is required for higher yield, good quality, biotic and abiotic resistance, shortening the maturity duration, wider adaptability and desirable agronomic characteristics. Farm animals require proper care and management such as shelter, feeding, breeding and disease control. This is called animal husbandry. Poultry farming is done to raise domestic fowls. Poultry production includes egg production and broiler production for poultry meat. To enhance poultry production, cross breeding is done between Indian and exotic breeds for variety improvement. Fish may be obtained from marine resources as well as inland resources. To increase production of fish, they can be cultured in marine and inland ecosystems.

Intercropping.,"all be of the same variety and germinate under the same conditions. Cultivation practices and crop yield are related to weather, soil quality and availability of water. Since weather conditions such as drought and flood situations are unpredictable, varieties that can be grown in diverse climatic conditions are useful. Similarly, varieties tolerant to high soil salinity have been developed. Some of the factors for which variety improvement is done are: • Higher yield: To increase the productivity of the crop per acre. • Improved quality: Quality considerations of crop products vary from crop to crop. Baking quality is important in wheat, protein quality in pulses, oil quality in oilseeds and preserving quality in fruits and vegetables. • Biotic and abiotic resistance: Crops production can go down due to biotic (diseases, insects and nematodes) and abiotic (drought, salinity, water logging, heat, cold and frost) stresses under different situations. Varieties resistant to these stresses can improve crop production. • Change in maturity duration: The shorter the duration of the crop from sowing to harvesting, the more economical is the variety. Such short durations allow far mers to grow multiple rounds of crops in a year. Short duration also reduces the cost of crop production. Uniform maturity makes the harvesting process easy and reduces losses during harvesting. • Wider adaptability: Developing varieties for wider adaptability will help in stabilising the crop production under dif ferent envir onmental conditions. One variety can then be grown under dif ferent climatic conditions in different areas. • Desirable agronomic characteristics: Tallness and profuse branching are desirable characters for fodder crops.

" You want to wear your favourite shirt in a party, but the problem is that it is still wet after a wash. Mention three steps with reason that you would take to dry it faster ?  It is a hot summer day; Priyanshi and Ali are wearing cotton and nylon clothes respectively.  Who do you think would be more comfortable and why ?  During rainy season we feel sticky and uncomfortable even under the fan why ?"," To dry it faster, rate of evaporation has to be increased, for this :  We can spread it to increase surface area.  We can iron it to increase temperature.  We can spread it under fan to increase wind speed.   Priyanshi will be more comfortable as in cotton clothes sweat will evaporate faster by taking latent heat of vapourization from the body and thus making it comfortable by taking away body’s heat faster.  During rainy season humidity is high so rate of evaporation is slower. 1 × 3 + 1 + 1","You must have observed that the rate of evaporation increases with– • an increase of surface area: We know that evaporation is a surface phenomenon. If the surface area is increased, the rate of evaporation increases. For example, while putting clothes for drying up we spread them out. • an increase of temperature: With the increase of temperature, more number of particles get enough kinetic energy to go into the vapour state. • a decrease in humidity: Humidity is the amount of water vapour present in air. The air around us cannot hold more than a definite amount of water vapour at a given temperature. If the amount of water in air is already high, the rate of evaporation decreases. • an increase in wind speed: It is a common observation that clothes dry faster on a windy day. With the increase in wind speed, the particles of water vapour move away with the wind, decreasing the amount of water vapour in the surrounding. DOES EVAPORATION CAUSE
 The rate of evaporation depends upon the surface area exposed to the atmosphere, the temperature, the humidity and the wind speed.

"During the training Sahil’s cricket coach taught him to pull his hands backwards while catching a fast moving cricket ball.  Was Sahil’s coach correct ?  Why does a fielder in the ground gradually pull his hands backwards with the ball, while catching a fast moving cricket ball ?  What would happen if a fielder does not take the advice properly ?  What value is associated with it ?"," Yes.  While catching a fast moving cricket ball, a fielder pulls his hands backwards with the ball. By doing so, the fielder increases the time during which the high velocity of the moving ball decreases to zero. Thus the acceleration of the ball is decreased and therefore the impact of catching the fast moving ball is also reduced and the fielder gets less hurt.  On the contrary, if the ball is stopped suddenly, the high velocity decreases to zero in a very short interval of time. Thus the rate of change of momentum of the ball is very large. Therefore, large force is applied for holding the catch that might hurt the palm of the fielder.  This shows that Sahil’s coach is intelligent and a good trainer.","Fig. 9.8: A fielder pulls his hands gradually with the moving ball while holding a catch. 120

Ravi’s mother was preparing sweets at home. She put some raisins in the water. Ravi saw the raisins and asked his mother that why the raisins had swelled up in water. His mother replied him scientifically and told that this is due to endosmosis.  What is Endosmosis ?  Why is plasma membrane called selectively permeable membrane ?  What values were shown by Ravi ?," Osmosis is the movement of water from the region of its higher concentration (pure water or dilute solution) to the region of its lower concentration, when the two are separated by a semipermeable membrane. When external water enters the cell it is known as Endosmosis.  Cell membrane is semi permeable membrane for water, ions, sugar, amino acids etc. These substances pass through the plasma membrane by an active process so it is called selectively permeable.  Ravi showed curiosity and skillfulness towards knowledge.","osmosis. The movement of water across the plasma membrane is also affected by the amount of substance dissolved in water. Thus, osmosis is the net diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane toward a higher solute concentration. What will happen if we put an animal cell or a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt in water? One of the following three things could happen: 1. If the medium surrounding the cell has a higher water concentration than the cell, meaning that the outside solution is very dilute, the cell will gain water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypotonic solution. Water molecules are free to pass across the cell membrane in both directions, but more water will come into the cell than will leave. The net (overall) result is that water enters the cell. The cell is likely to swell up. 2. If the medium has exactly the same water concentration as the cell, there will be no net movement of water across the cell membrane. Such a solution is known as an isotonic solution. Water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but the amount going in is the same as the amount going out, so there is no overall movement of water. The cell will stay the same size. 3. If the medium has a lower concentration of water than the cell, meaning that it is a very concentrated solution, the cell will lose water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypertonic solution. Again, water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but this time more water leaves the cell than enters it. Therefore the cell will shrink. Thus, osmosis is a special case of diffusion through a selectively permeable membrane. Now let us try out the following activity: 60

Sheela was washing clothes for a long time. She saw her hands and she found that the skin of her fingers was shrunk. She was amazed to see her hands and was worried.  Why does the skin of Sheela’s fingers shrink when she washes clothes for a long time ?  What makes Sheela worried ?," Clothes are washed with soap or detergent solution. This solution is hypertonic as compared to osmotic concentration of our skin cells. The washing solution, therefore, causes exosmosis in the skin cells that come in contact with if for sometime. Because of it, the skin over the fingers shrinks while washing clothes for a longtime.  Sheela was worried because her fingers had shrunk. But she didn’t know that after sometime her fingers will come back to their original shape.","You must have observed that the rate of evaporation increases with– • an increase of surface area: We know that evaporation is a surface phenomenon.

Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from solution with lower solute concentration  to the solution with higher solute concentration  through a selectively permeable membrane. The movement takes place due to the osmotic gradient created by difference in concentration of the solutions on both sides of the membrane and the end result is a state where osmotic equilibrium is reached wherein movement of the fluid ceases.  What is the importance of osmosis in daily life ? Give four examples.  Is it useful for plants or not ?,"  When your hands are immersed in dishwater for a long time, your skin looks bloated. This is an effect of osmosis. 		 When you pour salt onto a slug, water diffuses and slug shrinks as a result of osmosis. 		 When you cook food and put sauce in the liquid part of your dish, some part of the solute moves inside the solid part of the food you are cooking. The solid part could be an egg, piece of meat but the sauce is made of solute and not water, so it will move into the food. 		 Osmosis also plays an important part in the body. It helps in the transfer of water and various nutrients between blood and fluid of cells. 		 Reverse osmosis is a type of osmosis which is used to convert sewage water into clean drinking water.   Yes, it is useful for plants.","What do we infer from this activity? It appears that only living cells, and not dead cells, are able to absorb water by osmosis. Cell walls permit the cells of plants, fungi and bacteria to withstand very dilute (hypotonic) external media without bursting. In such media the cells tend to take up water by osmosis. The cell swells, building up pressure against the cell wall. The wall exerts an equal pressure against the swollen cell. Because of their walls, such cells can withstand much greater changes in the surrounding medium than animal cells.

"Akhtar, Kiran and Rahul were riding in a motorcar that was moving with a high velocity on an expressway when an insect hit the windshield and got stuck on the windscreen.

Kiran suggested that the insect suffered a greater change in momentum as compared to the change in momentum of the motorcar (because the change in the velocity of the insect was much more than that of the motorcar).  Akhtar said that since the motorcar was moving with a larger velocity, it exerted a larger force on the insect. And as a result the insect died.  Rahul while putting an entirely new explanation said that both the motorcar and the insect experienced the same force and a change in their momentum.
