Classify bacteria on the basis of their shape.,"Bacteria are classified as given below: (i) Cocci : They are oval or spherical in shape. When they occur singly, they are called Micrococcus; if in pairs Diplococcus; if in a chain, Streptococcus; and if occur in clusters, Staphylococcus. (ii) Bacilli: They are rod-like, with or without flagella. Flagella may be present at one or both the ends or around cells. Bacteria may occur singly, Bacillus; or in pairs, Diplobacillus or may form filaments, Streptobacillus. (ii) Vibrio : They are small and curved like commas. These are mostly motile. (iv) Spirillum : These are twisted like a screw. They have flagella at one end or both the ends. Certain bacteria possess flagella for locomotion.","Bacteria are the sole members of the Kingdom Monera. They are the most abundant micro-organisms. Bacteria occur almost everywhere. Hundreds of bacteria are present in a handful of soil. They also live in extreme habitats such as hot springs, deserts, snow and deep oceans where very few other life forms can survive. Many of them live in or on other organisms as parasites. Bacteria are grouped under four categories based on their shape: the spherical Coccus (pl.: cocci), the rod-shaped Bacillus (pl.: bacilli), the comma-shaped Vibrium (pl.: vibrio) and the spiral Spirillum (pl.: spirilla) (Figure 2.1).

Describe the major groups of Protista.,"The kingdom Protista includes unicellular, eukaryotic organisms. They include both Posynthetic and non-photosynthetic forms. The kingdom Protista includes protistan algae, slime moulds and protozoans. (i) Protistan algae: They are photosynthetic protists. They include dinoflagellates and diatoms. (a) Dinoflagellates: These are golden brown biflagellated Photosynthetic protists. They possess cellulose wall in the form of distinct interlocking plates. (b) Diatoms: They are group of golden brown Photosynthetic protists which are covered by two valved silicious wall called shell or frustule. They pile up at the bottom water reservoirs and form big heap called diatomite. (ii) Slime moulds : Slime moulds are both plants and animals like. They are plant like in the production of spores, and animal like in the mode of nutrition and somatic organisation. It moves freely on the substratum and feeds on bacteria, fungal and algal spores and also absorb nutrients directly from the substratum. (iii) Protozoa : These are microscopic unicellular organisms with varied shapes and forms. This may be free living, commensal or parasitic. They lack cell wall, but some possess proteinaceous flexible pellicle. Locomotion occurs by pseudopodia, flagella or cilia. These reproduce asexually by binary fission. Some reproduce sexually by conjugation.","2.2 KINGDOM PROTISTA All single-celled eukaryotes are placed under Protista, but the boundaries of this kingdom are not well defined.

Write Short notes on: (i) Methanogens (ii) Halophiles (iii) Thermoacidophiles. ,"(i) Cyanobacteria or blue-green algae are gram(+) photosynthetic prokaryotes which perform oxygenic photosynthesis (ii) Cell structure is typically prokaryotic-one envelope organisation with peptidoglycan wall naked DNA, 70S ribosomes, devoid of membrane bound cell organelles. (iii) The outer part of the protoplast contains a number of photosynthetic thylakoids. It is called as chromoplasm. (iv) Their membranes contain chlorophyll a, carotenes and xanthophylls. Chlorophyll b is absent. (v) DNA lies coiled generally in central part of the cytoplasm known as centroplasm. (vi) Small circular DNA segments may also occur in nucleoid, known as plasmid or transposons.","3.1.1 Chlorophyceae The members of chlorophyceae are commonly called green algae. The plant body may be unicellular, colonial or filamentous. They are usually grass green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and b. The pigments are localised in definite chloroplasts. The chloroplasts may be discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon-shaped in different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids located in the chloroplasts. Pyrenoids contain protein besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made of an inner layer of cellulose and an outer layer of pectose. Vegetative reproduction usually takes place by fragmentation or by formation of different types of spores. Asexual reproduction is by flagellated zoospores produced in zoosporangia. The sexual reproduction shows considerable variation in the type and formation of sex cells and it may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Some commonly found green algae are: Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Ulothrix, Spirogyra and Chara (Figure 3.1a).

What are the salient features of kingdom Fungi? ,"Kingdom Fungi : The kingdom fungi, includes achlorophyllous, spore producing, multicellular, eukaryotic organisms . Salient features: (i) The body of fungi is filamentous called mycelium. The filaments are known as hyphae. (ii) The hyphae are either multicellular or coenocytic i.e. multinucleate and without cross walls. (iii) The cell wall contain chitin and non-cellulosic polysaccharides N-acetyl - glucosamine. (iv) They have two envelop type of cellular organisation. (v) The are heterotrophic with absorptive type of nutrition. It is either saprobic or parasitic. Saprobic fungi excrete digestive enzymes in the external medium to make complex organic matter soluble for absorption. Parasitic fungi absorb nourishment directly from another living organism called host. (vi) Reserve food is glycogen and fat. (vii) Reproduction is both asexual and sexual. Asexual reproduction takes place by spores like zoospores, conidia, ascospores and basidiospores. Sexual reproduction involves fusion of similar gametes. In some fungi, the fusion of two haploid (n) cells results in diploid (2n) cell or zygote. (viii) Many fungi act as decomposers and mineralisers and thus, play an important role in nutrient cycling in the biosphere.","KINGDOM FUNGI
 The fungi constitute a unique kingdom of heterotrophic organisms. They show a great diversity in morphology and habitat. You must have seen fungi on a moist bread and rotten fruits. The common mushroom you eat and toadstools are also fungi. White spots seen on mustard leaves are due to a parasitic fungus. Some unicellular fungi, e.g., yeast are used to make bread and beer. Other fungi cause diseases in plants and animals; wheat rust-causing Puccinia is an important example. Some are the source of antibiotics, e.g., Penicillium. Fungi are cosmopolitan and occur in air, water, soil and on animals and plants. They prefer to grow in warm and humid places. Have you ever wondered why we keep food in the refrigerator ? Yes, it is to prevent food from going bad due to bacterial or fungal infections. With the exception of yeasts which are unicellular, fungi are filamentous. Their bodies consist of long, slender thread-like structures called hyphae. The network of hyphae is known as mycelium. Some hyphae are continuous tubes filled with multinucleated cytoplasm ‚Äì these are called coenocytic hyphae. Others have septae or cross walls in their hyphae.

Q. 8.. Explain in detail the various methods of asexual reproduction in fungi.,Kingdom Plantae contains all photosynthetic eukaryotic multicellular organisms and their non-photosynthetic relatives..  The salient features of kingdom Plantae are: (i) Organisms are multicellular except for some algae. (ii) They are eukaryotic. (iii) Body form is less regular and Growth is usually indefinite. (iv) Mode of nutrition is oxygenic photosynthesis. (v) The photosynthetic regions contain chlorophyll. (vi) The plants are usually fixed or free-floating. (vii) Structural differentiation into tissues is found except for certain algae. (viii) The cells contain central vacuoles. (ix) Food reserve is usually starch and fat. (x) Some of the plants are heterotrophic such as insectivorous plants. (xi) Reproduction is both asexual and sexual. Accessory spores are present in lower plants.  ,"2.4 KINGDOM PLANTAE Kingdom Plantae includes all eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing organisms commonly called plants. A few members are partially heterotrophic such as the insectivorous plants or parasites. Bladderwort and Venus fly trap are examples of insectivorous plants and Cuscuta is a parasite. The plant cells have an eukaryotic structure with prominent chloroplasts and cell wall mainly made of cellulose. You will study the eukaryotic cell structure in detail in Chapter 8. Plantae includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms. Life cycle of plants has two distinct phases ‚Äì the diploid sporophytic and the haploid gametophytic ‚Äì that alternate with each other. The lengths of the haploid and diploid phases, and whether these phases are free‚Äì living or dependent on others, vary among different groups in plants. This phenomenon is called alternation of generation. You will study further details of this kingdom in Chapter 3.

How many types of meristems are found on the basis of origin?,"Depending upon the mode of origin, meristems are classified into three types: (i) Promeristem: (a) Promeristems are also called primordial meristems or embryonic meristems. (b) These are localized groups of meristematic cells in germinating embryos or young seedlings. (c) Promeristems give rise to primary meristems where formation of new organs are initiated. (ii) Primary meristems: (a) These are the meristems, which are derived from the promeristems and retain the capacity to divide throughout the life of the plant. (b) They are represented by apical meristem, intercalary meristem and intrafascicular cambium. (c) The primary meristems form different primary permanent tissues. (d) The intrafascicular cambium, produces secondary vascular tissues and medullary rays. (iii) Secondary meristems: (a) These are the meristem, which are formed from permanent tissues by the process of differentiation. (b) They are represented by interfascicular cambium, vascular cambium, cork cambium or phellogen, wound cambium and accessory cambium. (c) They all are lateral in position and give rise to secondary permanent tissues that result in radial growth.","Root apical meristem occupies the tip of a root while the shoot apical meristem occupies the distant most region of the stem axis. During the formation of leaves and elongation of stem, some cells ‚Äòleft behind‚Äô from shoot apical meristem, constitute the axillary bud. Such buds are present in the axils of leaves and are capable of forming a branch or a flower. The meristem which occurs between mature tissues is known as intercalary meristem. They occur in grasses and regenerate parts removed by the grazing herbivores. Both apical meristems and intercalary meristems are primary meristems because they appear early in life of a plant and contribute to the formation of the primary plant body. The meristem that occurs in the mature regions of roots and shoots of many plants, particularly those that produce woody axis and appear later than primary meristem is called the secondary or lateral meristem. They are cylindrical meristems. Fascicular vascular cambium, interfascicular cambium and cork-cambium are examples of lateral meristems. These are responsible for producing the secondary tissues. Following divisions of cells in both primary and as well as secondary meristems, the newly formed cells become structurally and functionally specialised and lose the ability to divide. Such cells are termed permanent or mature cells and constitute the permanent tissues. During the formation of the primary plant body, specific regions of the apical meristem produce dermal tissues, ground tissues and vascular tissues.

Give a brief account on the components of xylem.,"Epidermal tissue system: It is the outermost protective tissue of the plant organs. It is derived from Protoderm and consists of epidermis, stomata and epidermal outgrowths. (i) Epidermis: (a) Epidermis is usually single layered, but in the leaves of some tropical plants it is more than one layer in thickness. (b) There is a layer of cutin, on the outer side of the epidermis of aerial parts of the plants called cuticle. (c) Epidermis along with cuticle protect the inner cells against loss of water, mechanical injury, attack of pathogens and leaching effect of rain. (d) The epidermis of grasses and cereals has a deposition of silica. (ii) Stomata are structures present in the epidermis of leaves which regulates the process of transpiration and gaseous exchange. (iii) Epidermal outgrowths: (a) The epidermis of most plants often bear outgrowths called epidermal outgrowths. They are of two type ‚Äì Trichomes and hairs. (a) On the stem, the epidermal hairs are called trichomes. They are usually multicellular, branched or unbranched and soft or stiff. They may be secondary also. The trichomes help in preventing water loss due to transpiration. (b) The root epidermis bears unicellular outgrowths called root hairs. It is therefore, also called piliferous layer or epiblema. It is mainly concerned with the absorption of water and minerals from the soil.","Epidermal Tissue System
 The epidermal tissue system forms the outer-most covering of the whole plant body and comprises epidermal cells, stomata and the epidermal appendages ‚Äì the trichomes and hairs. The epidermis is the outermost layer of the primary plant body. It is made up of elongated, compactly

What is root apes? Name the three meristematic regions of it.,"Meristems or meristematic tissues are the tissues which are made up of group of immature and similar cells, that are in continuous state of division, forming new cells. The cells of a meristematic tissue are characterised by the following features: (i) The cells are immature and are capable of dividing indefinitely. (ii) They are small and thin walled cells, without intercellular spaces. (iii) The cells are generally isodiametric (almost of same length and breadth) and are rounded, oval or polygonal in outline. (iv) They have thin and elastic cell wall, made up of cellulose. (v) The vacuoles are absent or are very small. Cambium cells, however, possess large vacuoles. (vi) The plastids are present in proplastid stage. (vii) The cells do not store reserve food and are in active stage of metabolism. (viii) The cells lack inorganic crystals and other ergastic substances. (ix) The meristematic cells are mother cells from which all other types of cells are formed.","Meristematic Tissues
 Growth in plants is largely restricted to specialised regions of active cell division called meristems (Gk. meristos: divided). Plants have different kinds of meristems. The meristems which occur at the tips of roots and shoots and produce primary tissues are called apical meristems (Figure 6.1).
 "
Q. 6 What is phloem? Explain its components.,"Phloem: Phloem is a complex permanent tissue, which is meant for the conduction of food within the plant. It is also called bast or leptome. Phloem consists of four types of cells: (i) Sieve elements: They are the main food conducting elements and are of two types-sieve cells and sieve tubes. (a) Sieve cells: They are elongated cells having several perforated areas called sieve areas. (b) Sieve tubes: They are elongated tubular channels. Each sieve tube is made up of several cells called sieve tube members. The end walls have many large pores or sieve pits and are known as sieve plates. Each sieve tube is associated with a companion cell. Sieve element take part in the transport of organic food. (ii) Companion cells: They are elongated thin walled parenchymatous cells, which lie on the sides of the sieve tubes. The companion cell and a sieve tube originate from the same mother cell. The companion cells play an important role in the maintenance of a pressure gradient in the sieve tubes. (iii) Phloem parenchyma: They are ordinary parenchyma cells, which are intermingled with sieve elements. They store food and also assist in the conduction of food in lateral direction. (iv) Phloem fibres: They are also called bast fibres, Phloem fibres are sclerenchymatous fibres, which occur in phloem. They provide mechanical strength. The textile fibres of flex,  hemp and jute are phloem fibres. ","and phloem fibres. Gymnosperms have albuminous cells and sieve cells. They lack sieve tubes and companion cells. Sieve tube elements are also long, tube-like structures, arranged longitudinally and are associated with the companion cells. Their end walls are perforated in a sieve-like manner to form the sieve plates. A mature sieve element possesses a peripheral cytoplasm and a large vacuole but lacks a nucleus. The functions of sieve tubes are controlled by the nucleus of companion cells. The companion cells are specialised parenchymatous cells, which are closely associated with sieve tube elements. The sieve tube elements and companion cells are connected by pit fields present between their common longitudinal walls. The companion cells help in maintaining the pressure gradient in the sieve tubes. Phloem parenchyma is made up of elongated, tapering cylindrical cells which have dense cytoplasm and nucleus. The cell wall is composed of cellulose and has pits through which plasmodesmatal connections exist between the cells. The phloem parenchyma stores food material and other substances like resins, latex and mucilage. Phloem parenchyma is absent in most of the monocotyledons. Phloem fibres (bast fibres) are made up of sclerenchymatous cells. These are generally absent in the primary phloem but are found in the secondary phloem. These are much elongated, unbranched and have pointed, needle like apices. The cell wall of phloem fibres is quite thick. At maturity, these fibres lose their protoplasm and become dead. Phloem fibres of jute, flax and hemp are used commercially. The first formed primary phloem consists of narrow sieve tubes and is referred to as protophloem and the later formed phloem has bigger sieve tubes and is referred to as metaphloem.

What are simple permanent tissues? Briefly explain their types.,"Simple permanent tissues: A simple permanent tissue is the tissue which is made up of similar permanent cells that carry out the same function or similar set of functions. Simple permanent tissues are of three types: (i) Parenchyma: (a) Parenchyma is a simple permanent living tissue which is made up of thin-walled similar isodiametric cells. (b) They may be oval, rounded or polygonal in outline. (c) The cell wall is made up of cellulose. (d) Cells may be closely packed or have small intercellular spaces for exchange of gases. Internally each cell encloses a large central vacuole and a peripheral cytoplasm containing nucleus. (e) The adjacent parenchyma cells are connected with one another by plasmodesmata. (f) The typical parenchyma is meant for the storage of food, slow conduction of various substances and for providing turgidity to the softer parts of the plants. (ii) Collenchyma: (a) Collenchyma is a simple permanent tissue of non-lignified living cells which possess pecto-cellulose thickenings in specific areas of their walls. (b) The cells are often elongated. They are circular, oval or angular in transverse section. Each cell possesses a large central vacuole and a peripheral cytoplasm. Wall possesses uneven longitudinal thickenings in specific areas. (iii) Sclerenchyma: (a) Sclerenchyma is a simple supportive tissue of highly thick-walled cells with little or no protoplasm. (b) The cell cavities are narrow. The thickening of the wall is made up of cellulose or lignin or both. (c) Sclerenchyma is of two types-Sclerenchyma fibres and Sclereids. (a) Sclerenchyma fibres: The sclerenchyma fibres are highly elongated, narrow and spindle-  shaped they have thick-walled cells with pointed or oblique end walls. The adjacent fibres possess simple oblique pits. Sclerenchyma fibres constitute the major mechanical tissue of the plants because they can bear compression, pull, bending and shearing. (b) Sclereids: They are highly thickened dead sclerenchyma cells with very narrow cavities. Sclereids are broader as compared to the fibres being isodiametric polyhedral, short or cylindrical.","Permanent Tissues
 The cells of the permanent tissues do not generally divide further. Permanent tissues having all cells similar in structure and function are called simple tissues. Permanent tissues having many different types of cells are called complex tissues. Intercelluar space

 Simple Tissues
 Simple Tissues
 A simple tissue is made of only one type of cells. The various simple tissues in plants are parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma (Figure 6.2). Parenchyma forms the major component within organs. The cells of the parenchyma are generally isodiametric. They may be spherical, oval, round, polygonal or elongated in shape. Their walls are thin and made up of cellulose. They may either be closely packed or have small intercellular spaces. The parenchyma performs various functions like photosynthesis, storage, secretion. The collenchyma occurs in layers below the epidermis in most of the dicotyledonous plants. It is found either as a homogeneous layer or in patches. It consists of cells which are much thickened at the corners due to a deposition of cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. Collenchymatous cells may be oval, spherical or polygonal and often contain chloroplasts. These cells assimilate food when they contain chloroplasts. Intercellular spaces are absent. They provide mechanical support to the growing parts of the plant such as young stem and petiole of a leaf. Sclerenchyma consists of long, narrow cells with thick and lignified cell walls having a few or numerous pits. They are usually dead and without protoplasts. On the basis of variation in form, structure, origin and development, sclerenchyma may be either fibres or sclereids. The fibres are thick-walled, elongated and pointed cells, generally occuring in groups, in various parts of the plant.

Explain how the activity of fascicular cambium and cork cambium contribute towards the growth in thickness of a dicot stem. ,"Primary growth produces growth in length and development of lateral appendages. Secondary growth is the formation of secondary tissues from lateral meristems. It increases the diameter of the stem. Secondary tissues are formed by two types of lateral meristems, fascicular cambium and cork cambium. Fascicular cambium: The vascular bundles have intrafascicular cambium between xylem and phloem. Interfascicular cambium is formed from parenchyma cells between vascular bundles. Fascicular and interfascicular cambium join to form a complete ring of vascular cambium. The cells of cambium ring divide diagonally to form secondary phloem outside and secondary xylem towards the inner side. The amount of secondary xylem produced is always greater than that of secondary phloem. Due to formation of greater amount of secondary xylem, the cambium ring moves towards the periphery and the primary xylem and phloem which were near together are separated far apart. Cork cambium: The outermost layer of cortex becomes meristematic and is called cork cambium. Sometimes hypodermis also become meristematic and forms cork cambium. The cells of cork cambium divide by periclinal division towards outer side to form cork. The cork has rectangular cells which become dead at maturity. These are highly thick walled due to the presence of a chemical called suberin. Thus cork is also called suberised tissue. The cork is impervious to water and thus outer layers like hypodermis and epidermis become dead. The cells of the cork Cambium also divide towards their inner side by periclinal divisions to form secondary cortex. It has loosely packed parenchymatous cells which are thick walled. The phellem, phellogen and phelloderm are collectively called periderm. All dead cells outer to cork cambium form bark. It includes dead cells cork, hypodermis and epidermis.","The growth of the roots and stems in length with the help of apical meristem is called the primary growth. Apart from primary growth most dicotyledonous plants exhibit an increase in girth. This increase is called the secondary growth. The tissues involved in secondary growth are the two lateral meristems: vascular cambium and cork cambium.
 "
How many vascular bundles are found on the basis of arrangements of xylem and phloem? ,"According to the arrangement of xylem and phloem, the vascular bundles are of following types: (i) Radial: The xylem and phloem form separate bundles and lie on different radii, alternating with each other. Radial bundles are the most primitive type of vascular bundles and are characteristic of roots. (ii) Conjoint: The vascular bundles which contain both xylem and phloem are called conjoint vascular bundles. The xylem and phloem are thus, arranged on the same radius. Conjoint bundles are of following three types:  (a) Collateral: A conjoint bundle with xylem towards the inner side facing the pith and phloem towards the outer side facing the cortex, is called collateral bundle. When in a collateral bundle, a strip of cambium is present between xylem and phloem, the bundle is called open bundle e.g., dicot stems. When a collateral bundle is without a strip of cambium, it is said to be closed, e.g., monocot stems. (b) Bicollateral: When a conjoint bundle has phloem both on the outer and inner side of xylem it is called bicollateral bundle. Usually a strip of cambium is present on both outer and inner sides of xylem. e.g., family Cucurbitaceae. (c) Concentric: A type of conjoint vascular bundle with one vascular element completely surrounds the other. Either the phloem surrounds xylem or xylem surrounds the phloem.","The vascular system consists of complex tissues, the phloem and the xylem.The xylem and phloem together constitute vascular bundles (Figure 6.5). In dicotyledonous stems, cambium is present between phloem and xylem. Such vascular bundles because of the presence of cambium possess the ability to form secondary xylem and phloem tissues, and hence are called open vascular bundles. In the monocotyledons, the vascular bundles have no cambium present in them. Hence, since they do not form secondary tissues they are referred to as closed. When xylem and phloem within a vascular bundle are arranged in an alternate manner along the different radii, the arrangement is called radial such as in roots. In conjoint type of vascular bundles, the xylem and phloem are jointly situated along the same radius of vascular bundles. Such vascular bundles are common in stems and leaves. The conjoint vascular bundles usually have the phloem located only on the outer side of xylem.

What is wood? Write its different types ,"Wood: A secondary xylem is called as wood. It is formed by the metabolism of the plant. i.e., secondary growth by cambium and constitutes the bulk of the plant body in dicot stems and dicot roots. Wood can be classified into the following categories: (i) Hard wood: It is the wood produced by angiosperms, It consists mainly of xylem vessels (95%) and hence called porous wood. (ii) Soft wood: It is the wood produced by gymnosperms. It consists mainly of xylem tracheids and hence called non-porous wood. (iii) Heart wood: It is the central core of wood formed during secondary growth. It consists of dead cells. The cells are dark in colour due to the presence of extractives like gums, resins, tannins etc. It is more durable and resistant to attack by microbes and insect pests. (iv) Sap wood: It is the peripheral part of the wood formed during secondary growth. It consists of living cells. The cells are lighter in colour (Compared to heart wood) as extractives are absent. It is less durable and resistant to attack by microbes and insects. (v) Early wood: It is the wood formed during favourable seasons (spring and summer). The vessels and tracheids are larger in dimensions. (vi) Late wood: It is the wood formed during unfavourable seasons (autumn and winter). The vessels and tracheids are smaller in dimension.","Monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants show marked variation in their internal structures. They differ in type, number and location of vascular bundles. The secondary growth occurs in most of the dicotyledonous roots and stems and it increases the girth (diameter) of the organs by the activity of the vascular cambium and the cork cambium. The wood is actually a secondary xylem. There are different types of wood on the basis of their composition and time of production.
 "
Why do stems of dicot plants increase in girth every year? Explain this growth with the help of suitable schematic diagrams.  Explain the process of secondary growth in the stem of weedy angiosperms with the help of schematic diagrams. ,"Secondary growth: It is the permanent increase in thickness due to the activity of the vascular cambium and cock cambium in stelar and extrastelar regions. The cock cambium gives rise to cork and secondary cortex whereas the vascular cambium gives rise to secondary xylem and secondary phloem. The roots of stem increase in girth due to secondary growth. Process of secondary growth in Typical Dicot Stem: The process of secondary growth in stem is completed in the following stages: Stage A. (i) It shows the primary structure of a young dicot stem. (ii) The vascular bundles are open and arranged in a ring. (iii) The cortex, medullary says and pith are well marked. (iv) The cambium between the phloem and xylem is called fascicular cambium' (intrafascicular  cambium). Stage B. (i) The medullary rays (parenchyma cells) in line with the intrafascicular cambium becomes meristematic and form the 'inter -fascicular cambium'. (ii) The intrafascicular and interfascicular cambium join and form a continuous cambial ring. Stage C. (i) By the meristematic activity of cambial cells, the secondary phloem is produced towards outside and the secondary xylem towards inside. (ii) Secondary xylem is produced in much amount than secondary phloem due to more divisions taking place towards the xylem. The primary and secondary phloems get gradually crushed due to the continued formation and accumulation of secondary xylem. Stage D. (i) Secondary growth continues resulting in the increasing amount of vascular tissue. (ii) The wood (older secondary xylem) is pushed towards the centre. (iii) The pith and the primary xylem get traced. This wood is called 'heart wood'. It is harder and more durable. It is mainly for mechanical support. (iv) The wood formed due to deposition of some kind of material, each year laying outside just internal to the hard of cambium is called ‚Äòsap wood‚Äô. It is softer than heart wood. It is mainly for conducting water and minerals. Annual rings, later wood and early wood: (i) During summer and spring seasons, the size of the secondary xylem vessels produced is much larger, whereas in winter and autumn the size of secondary xylem vessels produced is much smaller. Thus in one year alternate smaller and larger vessels are seen as rings in the wood. (ii) A single growth ring formed each year is called 'annual ring'. (iii) These rings are helpful in determining the age of a tree. (iv) The denser wood having more fibres is called 'late wood'. The larger thinner walled wood with less fibres is called 'early wood‚Äô.  Fig. Secondary growth in a dicot stem (diagrammatic) stages in transverse views","The growth of the roots and stems in length with the help of apical meristem is called the primary growth. Apart from primary growth most dicotyledonous plants exhibit an increase in girth. This increase is called the secondary growth. The tissues involved in secondary growth are the two lateral meristems: vascular cambium and cork cambium.

Describe the internal structure of a dicotyledonous stem/root.,"(A) Internal structure of a dicot stem: (i) Epidermis: It is the outermost single layered covering of stem having no intercellular spaces. It is covered by cuticle to reduce transpiration. Multicellular hairs are also present.  (ii) Cortex: Inner to the epidermis is cortex consisting of multilayered hypodermis and parenchymatous cortex to provide mechanical strength. Resin ducts may be in the region of cortex. (iii) Endodermis: It is the outermost layer of cortex having barrel-shaped parenchyma cells containing starch grains. (iv) Stele: Stele includes Pericycle, vascular bundles, pith (medulla) and pith rays (medullary rays). Vascular bundles vary from 5-7 in numbers and are arranged in a ring. They are open and collateral. Xylem is endarch. Pith lies in the centre having parenchyma cells with intercellular spaces.  (B) Internal structure of a dicotyledonous root: (i) Epiblema: It is called piliferous layer (outermost one-celled thick). Unicellular root hairs extend to outside from the epiblema. (ii) Cortex: It is the main part of root having many layers of rounded parenchymatous cells containing starch grains. Intercellular spaces are present in between them. It stores food substances. (iii) Endodermis: It lies inner to cortex and contains barrel-shaped cells having no intercellular spaces. Radial walls of its cells may have lignified casparian strips. Water and minerals pass through passage cells to phloem. (iv) Stele: It is the central part of dicot root. Inner to endodermis lies Pericycle which is single layered thick only. Vascular bundles form a ring. Phloem and xylem are present in different radii to form separate bundles.  Xylem in exarch: In the centre, pith and xylem fuse together. Phloem has sieve tubes, companion cells and phloem parenchyma. Between xylem and phloem conjunctive tissue is present.","present on the inner side of the endodermis and above the phloem in the form of semi-lunar patches of sclerenchyma. In between the vascular bundles there are a few layers of radially placed parenchymatous cells, which constitute medullary rays. A large number of vascular bundles are arranged in a ring ; the ‚Äòring‚Äô arrangement of vascular bundles is a characteristic of dicot stem. Each vascular bundle is conjoint, open, and with endarch protoxylem. A large number of rounded, parenchymatous cells with large intercellular spaces which occupy the central portion of the stem constitute the pith.
 "
Write a detailed note on the vascular bundles of monocot root ,"Vascular bundles: (a) It is in the form of several alternate and radial xylem and phloem bundles. (b) The number is 20-30 in maize. (c) In many cases the vascular bundles are embedded in a cylinder of sclerenchymatous conjunctive tissue. (d) The vascular bundles are arranged in the form of ring around a central pith. (e) The xylem bundles are exarch, i.e., protoxylem lies towards the outside while the metaxylem faces inward. Because of the presence of numerous xylem bundles and exarch condition, xylem of monocot root is polyarch. (f) Xylem is made up of rounded or oval vessels, and are narrow. (g) Xylem provides mechanical strength and helps in the conduction of water and mineral salts. (h) Phloem bundles alternate with the xylem bundles. These two are separated from each other by means of narrow strip of conjunctive tissue. (i) Monocotyledonous roots do not undergo any secondary growth.  ","The vascular system consists of complex tissues, the phloem and the xylem.The xylem and phloem together constitute vascular bundles (Figure 6.5). In dicotyledonous stems, cambium is present between phloem and xylem. Such vascular bundles because of the presence of cambium possess the ability to form secondary xylem and phloem tissues, and hence are called open vascular bundles. In the monocotyledons, the vascular bundles have no cambium present in them. Hence, since they do not form secondary tissues they are referred to as closed. When xylem and phloem within a vascular bundle are arranged in an alternate manner along the different radii, the arrangement is called radial such as in roots. In conjoint type of vascular bundles, the xylem and phloem are jointly situated along the same radius of vascular bundles. Such vascular bundles are common in stems and leaves. The conjoint vascular bundles usually have the phloem located only on the outer side of xylem.

Discuss the modern concept of cell theory.   ,Modern cell theory is also known as cell doctrine or cell principle. This theory states that: (i) The bodies of all living beings are made up of cells and their products. (ii) Cells are the structural and functional units of living organisms. (iii) Life exists only in cells because all the activities of life are performed by cells. (iv) Each cell maintains its individuality. It has a specific internal environment and homeostasis. (v) Growth of an organism involves the growth and multiplication of its cell. New cells arise from pre-existing cells through division.,"SUMMARY According to the cell theory, cells arise from preexisting cells. The process by which this occurs is called cell division. Any sexually reproducing organism starts its life cycle from a single-celled zygote. Cell division does not stop with the formation of the mature organism but continues throughout its life cycle.
 "
Describe the structure of cell wall.,"The cell wall is differentiated into three parts middle lamella, primary wall and secondary wall. (i) Middle lamella: (i) It is a thin amorphous cementing layer between two adjacent cells. (ii) It is the first layer, which is deposited at the time of cytokinesis. (iii) It is composed of calcium and magnesium pectate. (ii) primary wall: (i) It is thin, elastic and extensible in growing cell. (ii) it grows by addition of wall material within the existing one. Such growth is termed as intussusception susception. (iii) This wall consist of a loose network of cellulose microfibrils. (iv) These microfibrils in fungi are made up of a polymer of acetyl glucosamine. (v) The matrix of wall is chiefly composed of water, hemicellulose, pectins and glycoproteins. (iii) Secondary wall: (i) After maturity, a thick secondary wall is laid inner to the primary wall by accretion or deposition of materials. It is found in many layers. (ii) A number of different materials may be deposited in the secondary wall, e.g., lignin and suberin. ","8.5.2 Cell Wall As you may recall, a non-living rigid structure called the cell wall forms an outer covering for the plasma membrane of fungi and plants. Cell wall not only gives shape to the cell and protects the cell from mechanical damage and infection, it also helps in cell-to-cell interaction and provides barrier to undesirable macromolecules. Algae have cell wall, made of cellulose, galactans, mannans and minerals like calcium carbonate, while in other plants it consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and proteins. The cell wall of a young plant cell, the primary wall is capable of growth, which gradually diminishes as the cell matures and the secondary wall is formed on the inner (towards membrane) side of the cell. The middle lamella is a layer mainly of calcium pectate which holds or glues the different neighbouring cells together. The cell wall and middle lamellae may be traversed by plasmodesmata which connect the cytoplasm of neighbouring cells.

Describe the ultrastructure and main functions of centrioles and basal bodies.,"Centrioles and Basal Bodies : Centrioles are cylindrical structures. They appear as small granules associated with a meiotic spindle during cell division. They occur in all lower plants, protozoa and higher animals. Ultrastructure: (i) Under the electron microscope, each centriole is seen to be formed of nine sets of evenly spaced peripheral fibrils of tubulin protein. (ii) Each of these sets is a triplet composed of three microtubules. Each microtubule has a ùëú diameter of about 250 . The triplets are found in the matrix. (iii) Sometimes delicate strands appear to connect sets of the triplets to each other. Also, from the central core of the cylinder, delicate strands connect sets of the triplets to each other giving a cartwheel appearance. (iv) Basal bodies are structures similar to the centrioles. They produce cilia and flagella. Functions of Centrioles: (i) Centrioles are the self-duplicating bodies. They contain DNA and RNA. (ii) The centrioles which give rise to cilia and flagella are known as basal bodies. (iii) Out of the two centrioles in the sperm, the distal centriole forms the axial filament.  Functions of Basal bodies: (i) Cilia and flagella arise from the basal bodies. (ii) Basal bodies are converted into centrioles.","Figure 8.10 Section of cilia/flagella showing different parts : (a) Electron micrograph (b) Diagrammatic representation of internal structure
 8.5.8 Cilia and Flagella Cilia (sing.: cilium) and flagella (sing.: flagellum) are hair-like outgrowths of the cell membrane. Cilia are small structures which work like oars, causing the movement of either the cell or the surrounding fluid. Flagella are comparatively longer and responsible for cell movement. The prokaryotic bacteria also possess flagella but these are structurally different from that of the eukaryotic flagella. The electron microscopic study of a cilium or the flagellum show that they are covered with plasma membrane. Their core called the axoneme, possesses a number of microtubules running parallel to the long axis. The axoneme usually has nine doublets of radially arranged peripheral microtubules, and a pair of centrally located microtubules. Such an arrangement of axonemal microtubules is referred to as the 9+2 array (Figure 8.10). The central tubules are connected by bridges and is also enclosed by a central sheath, which is connected to one of the tubules of each peripheral doublets by a radial spoke. Thus, there are nine radial spokes. The peripheral doublets are also interconnected by linkers. Both the cilium and flagellum emerge from centriole-like structure called the basal bodies.

 made up of nine evenly spaced peripheral fibrils of tubulin protein. Each of the peripheral fibril is a triplet.The adjacent triplets are also linked. The central part of the proximal region of the centriole is also proteinaceous and called the hub, which is connected with tubules of the peripheral triplets by radial spokes made of protein. The centrioles form the basal body of cilia or flagella, and spindle fibres that give rise to spindle apparatus during cell division in animal cells.

What are the methods of passage of substances across the cell membrane?,"The passage of substances across the cell membrane occurs by three methods :  (i) Passive transport: It is a mode of membrane transport which occurs without the expenditure of cell energy. Passive transport occurs by diffusion or osmosis. Neutral solutes may move across the membrane by the process of simple diffusion along the concentration gradient. Osmosis is a special type of diffusion in which only water molecules migrate across a semipermeable membrane from the area of high concentration to the area of low concentration. (ii) Active transport: It is the movement of materials across the membrane against the concentration gradient. This often leads to accumulation of substances at a higher concentration within the cell than outside. Energy is required for such a process, which is usually provided by ATP. There are certain proteins in the membrane, which acts as a carrier molecules or carrier proteins. It has a binding site for the substrate. This transports the carrier bound substrate to other side of the membrane. (iii) Bulk transport: It includes exocytosis and endocytosis, which are the processes for active cellular extrusion and intake respectively of such materials that cannot pass through the unbroken plasma membrane. Both the processes involve movement and folding of the membrane, which depends on its fluidity and mobility.","11.1.3 Active Transport Active transport uses energy to transport and pump molecules against a concentration gradient. Active transport is carried out by specific membrane-proteins. Hence different proteins in the membrane play a major role in both active as well as passive transport. Pumps are proteins that use energy to carry substances across the cell membrane. These pumps can transport substances from a low concentration to a high concentration (‚Äòuphill‚Äô transport). Transport rate reaches a maximum when all the protein transporters are being used or are saturated. Like enzymes the carrier protein is very specific in what it carries across the membrane. These proteins are sensitive to inhibitors that react with protein side chains.
 11.1.4 Comparison of Different Transport Processes Table 11.1 gives a comparison of the different transport mechanisms. Proteins in the membrane are responsible for facilitated diffusion and active transport and hence show common characterstics of being highly selective; they are liable to saturate, respond to inhibitors and are under hormonal regulation. But diffusion whether facilitated or not ‚Äì take place only along a gradient and do not use energy.

Explain the structure of ribosome? Name two organelles of the cytoplasm in which they are found.,"Ribosomes: (i) These are granular organelles which are not enclosed by any membrane. (ii) These are found either in free state in the cytoplasm or attached to the endoplasmic reticulum. (iii) The ribosomes found in mitochondrial matrix and chloroplast stroma are of 70S type. (iv) Ribosomes are commonly called as cell engines as they are the sites of protein synthesis.  ùëú ùëú to 250 in diameter. Ribosomes are composed of roughly equal amount of protein and RNA. (v) under electron microscope, they appear as spherical bodies of about 150  (vi) The ribosomes consist of two unequal sized units arranged on top of each other. The eukaryotic cells have large ribosomes than prokaryotic cells. (vii) The prokaryotic ribosomes are 70S while the eukaryotic ribosomes are 80S type. 70S ribosomes have two sub-units 50S and 30S while 80S ribosome have larger 60S and smaller 40S subunit.","8.5.6 Ribosomes Ribosomes are the granular structures first observed under the electron microscope as dense particles by George Palade (1953). They are composed of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins and are not surrounded by any membrane. The eukaryotic ribosomes are 80S while the prokaryotic ribosomes are 70S. Each ribosome has two subunits, larger and smaller subunits (Fig 8.9). The two subunits of 80S ribosomes are 60S and 40S while that of 70S ribosomes are 50S and 30S. Here ‚ÄòS‚Äô (Svedberg‚Äôs Unit) stands for the sedimentation coefficient; it is indirectly a measure of density and size. Both 70S and Figure 8.9 Ribosome 80S ribosomes are composed of two subunits.

What are the three structural elements of endoplasmic reticulum ? Explain in brief.,"ER is an inner connected system of membrane- bound channels in the cytoplasm of the cells. There are three structural elements of ER : (i) Cisternae: The cisternae are broad flat membrane bound space arranged parallel to each other to form lamellae. e.g., Pancreas and liver cells. (ii) Vesicles: The vesicles are spherical spaces (25-500 nm in diameter). (iii) Tubules: The tubules are less small and branched tubular spaces found in cells which synthesize steroids and are 50-100 nm in diameter. ","8.5.3.1 The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Electron microscopic studies of eukaryotic cells reveal the presence of a network or reticulum of tiny tubular structures scattered in the cytoplasm that is called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 8.5). Hence, ER divides the intracellular space into two distinct compartments, i.e., luminal (inside ER) and extra luminal (cytoplasm) compartments. The ER often shows ribosomes attached to their outer surface. The endoplasmic reticulun bearing ribosomes on their surface is called rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). In the absence of ribosomes they appear smooth and are called smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). RER is frequently observed in the cells actively involved in protein synthesis and secretion. They are extensive and continuous with the outer membrane of the nucleus. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the major site for synthesis of lipid. In animal cells lipid-like steroidal hormones are synthesised in SER.

 membrane-bound structure with the outer membrane and the inner membrane dividing its lumen distinctly into two aqueous compartments, i.e., the outer compartment and the inner compartment. The inner compartment is filled with a dense homogeneous substance called the matrix. The outer membrane forms the continuous limiting boundary of the organelle. The inner membrane forms a number of infoldings called the cristae (sing.: crista) towards the matrix (Figure 8.7). The cristae increase the surface area. The two membranes have their own specific enzymes associated with the mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are the sites of aerobic respiration. They produce cellular energy in the form of ATP, hence they are called ‚Äòpower houses‚Äô of the cell.

Describe the ultrastructure and function of Golgi apparatus.,"Ultrastructure of Golgi apparatus: (i) The structure of Golgi apparatus appears to be complex. Under the electron microscope, the structure appears as stacks of flattened sacs (cisternae) which are bounded by a membrane having a smooth surface. (ii) These are often connected with flattened sacs or vesicles of various shape and size. Functions of Golgi apparatus : (i) Secretion: It has been established that the cells that perform secretory functions have well developed Golgi apparatus. The secretion may be in the form of lipids, enzymes, hormones, etc. (ii) Cell wall formation in plants : In plants, dictyosomes are known to synthesize pectin and some carbohydrates necessary for the formation of the cell walls. (iv) Acrosome formation: During spermatogenesis, Golgi apparatus forms the acrosome. (v) Lysosome formation : It has been established that secretory vesicles or primary lysosomes are produced from the sacs of the Glogi apparatus. (vi) Membrane transformation: Golgi bodies are also involved in the transformation of one type of membrane into another type. (vii) Storage, condensation and packaging of the materials: The Golgi bodies are involved in storage, condensation, packaging and transfer of materials. ","8.5.3.2 Golgi apparatus Camillo Golgi (1898) first observed densely stained reticular structures near the nucleus. These were later named Golgi bodies after him. They consist of many flat, disc-shaped sacs or cisternae of 0.5¬µm to 1.0¬µm diameter (Figure 8.6). These are stacked parallel to each other. Varied number of cisternae are present in a Golgi complex. The Golgi cisternae are concentrically arranged near the nucleus with distinct convex cis or the forming

 face and concave trans or the maturing face. The cis and the trans faces of the organelle are entirely different, but interconnected. The golgi apparatus principally performs the function of packaging materials, to be delivered either to the intra-cellular targets or secreted outside the cell. Materials to be packaged in the form of vesicles from the ER fuse with the cis face of the golgi apparatus and move towards the maturing face. This explains, why the golgi apparatus remains in close association with the endoplasmic reticulum. A number of proteins synthesised by ribosomes on the endoplasmic reticulum are modified in the cisternae of the golgi apparatus before they are released from its trans face. Golgi apparatus is the important site of formation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. 8.5.3.3 Lysosomes These are membrane bound vesicular structures formed by the process of packaging in the golgi apparatus. The isolated lysosomal vesicles have been found to be very rich in almost all types of hydrolytic enzymes (hydrolases ‚Äì lipases, proteases, carbohydrases) optimally active at the acidic pH. These enzymes are capable of digesting carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. 8.5.3.4 Vacuoles The vacuole is the membrane-bound space found in the cytoplasm. It contains water, sap, excretory product and other materials not useful for the cell. The vacuole is bound by a single membrane called tonoplast. In plant cells the vacuoles can occupy up to 90 per cent of the volume of the cell. In plants, the tonoplast facilitates the transport of a number of ions and other materials against concentration gradients into the vacuole, hence their concentration is significantly higher in the vacuole than in the cytoplasm. In Amoeba the contractile vacuole is important for osmoregulation and excretion. In many cells, as in protists, food vacuoles are formed by engulfing the food particles.

What are plastids? How are they classified?,"Plastids are semi-autonomous organelles having DNA and double membrane envelope which store or synthesize various types of organic compounds. Depending upon their colour, plastids are of three types: (i) Leucoplast: They are colourless plastids of varied shapes and sizes with stored nutrients occurs near the nucleus and possess internal lamellae. Leucoplast are of three types: starch containing amyloplast, fats storing elaioplast and proteins bearing proteinoplast. Grana and photosynthetic pigments are absent in leucoplast. (ii) Chromoplast: These are coloured plastids with reddish and yellow colours because of the presence of carotenoid pigments. The pigments are often found in crystallised state so that the shape of the plastids can be like needles, spindles or irregular. These provide colour to many flowers for attracting pollinating insects. They are also the site of synthesis of membrane lipids. (iii) Chloroplast: They are green plastids which possess photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll and carotenoids, and take part in the synthesis of food from inorganic raw materials in the presence of radiation energy.","8.5.5 Plastids Plastids are found in all plant cells and in euglenoides. These are easily observed under the microscope as they are large. They bear some specific pigments, thus imparting specific colours to the plants. Based on the type of pigments plastids can be classified into chloroplasts, chromoplasts and leucoplasts. The chloroplasts contain chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments which are responsible for trapping light energy essential for photosynthesis. In the chromoplasts fat soluble carotenoid pigments like carotene, xanthophylls and others are present. This gives the part of the plant a yellow, orange or red colour. The leucoplasts are the colourless plastids of varied shapes and sizes with stored nutrients: Amyloplasts store carbohydrates (starch), e.g., potato; elaioplasts store oils and fats whereas

Who proposed the fluid mosaic model of plasma membrane? Describe the fluid mosaic model of plasma membrane with the help of labelled diagram.  Describe the composition of cell membrane as suggested by Singer and Nicolson.  Describe the fluid mosaic model of plasma membrane with the help of labelled diagram. ,"Fluid mosaic model: (i) Fluid mosaic model was proposed by Singer and Nicolson.  (ii) According to this model, there is a central lipid bilayer of phospholipids with their polar head group towards the outside and the non-polar tails pointing inwards. (iij) Some proteins which are embedded in the lipid layer are called integral or intrinsic proteins and they cannot be separated from the membrane. (iv) There are large globular integral proteins which project beyond the lipid layer on both the sides are believed to have channels through which water-soluble materials can pass across. (v) Superficially attached proteins are called extrinsic. or peripheral proteins and can be easily removed. (vi) Some membrane lipids and integral proteins remains bound to oligosaccharides which project into the extracellular fluid and influence the manner in which cells interact with one another. ","8.5.1 Cell Membrane The detailed structure of the membrane was studied only after the advent of the electron microscope in the 1950s. Meanwhile, chemical studies on the cell membrane, especially in human red blood cells (RBCs), enabled the scientists to deduce the possible structure of plasma membrane. These studies showed that the cell membrane is mainly composed of lipids and proteins. The major lipids are phospholipids that are arranged in a bilayer. Also, the lipids are arranged within the membrane with the polar head towards the outer sides and the hydrophobic tails towards the inner part.This ensures that the nonpolar tail of saturated hydrocarbons is protected from the aqueous environment (Figure 8.4). In addition to phospholipids membrane also contains cholesterol. Later, biochemical investigation clearly revealed that the cell membranes also possess protein and carbohydrate. The ratio of protein and lipid varies considerably in different cell types. In human beings, the membrane of the erythrocyte has approximately 52 per cent protein and 40 per cent lipids. Depending on the ease of extraction, membrane proteins can be classified as integral and peripheral. Peripheral proteins lie on the surface of membrane while the integral proteins are partially or totally buried in the membrane. Sugar
 Peripheral Protein Phospholipid bilayer
 Peripheral Protein Phospholipid bilayer
 Cholesterol Figure 8.4 Fluid mosaic model of plasma membrane
 An improved model of the structure of cell membrane was proposed by Singer and Nicolson (1972) widely accepted as fluid mosaic model (Figure 8.4). According to this, the quasi-fluid nature of lipid enables lateral movement of proteins within the overall bilayer. This ability to move within the membrane is measured as its fluidity. The fluid nature of the membrane is also important from the point of view of functions like cell growth, formation of intercellular junctions, secretion, endocytosis, cell division etc. One of the most important functions of the plasma membrane is the transport of the molecules across it. The membrane is selectively permeable to some molecules present on either side of it. Many molecules can move briefly across the membrane without any requirement of energy and this is called the passive transport. Neutral solutes may move across the membrane by the process of simple diffusion along the concentration gradient, i.e., from higher concentration to the lower. Water may also move across this membrane from higher to lower concentration. Movement of water by diffusion is called osmosis. As the polar molecules cannot pass through the nonpolar lipid bilayer, they require a carrier protein of the membrane to facilitate their transport across the membrane. A few ions or molecules are transported across the membrane against their concentration gradient, i.e., from lower to the higher concentration. Such a transport is an energy dependent process, in which ATP is utilised and is called active transport, e.g., Na+/K+ Pump.

The axoneme usually has nine doublets of radially arranged peripheral microtubules, and a pair of centrally located microtubules. Such an arrangement of axonemal microtubules is referred to as the 9+2 array (Figure 8.10). The central tubules are connected by bridges and is also enclosed by a central sheath, which is connected to one of the tubules of each peripheral doublets by a radial spoke. Thus, there are nine radial spokes. The peripheral doublets are also interconnected by linkers. Both the cilium and flagellum emerge from centriole-like structure called the basal bodies.

Explain Van Niel experiment on purple and green sulphur bacteria.,"Van Niel on his studies with purple and green sulphur bacteria doemonstrated that photosynthesis is a light dependent reaction in which hydrogen from an oxidisable compound reduces CO2 to form sugar. 2H2 A + CO2 ‚Üí  ùëôùëñùëî‚Ñéùë°  2A + CH2 O  In Green plants, HO is the hydrogen donor and is oxidised to O2 In green sulphur bacteria, when H2 O instead of HO was used as hydrogen donor no O2 was evolved. He inferred that O2 evolved by green plants come from H2 O but not from C O2","where [CH2O] represented a carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, a six-carbon sugar). A milestone contribution to the understanding of photosynthesis was that made by a microbiologist, Cornelius van Niel (1897-1985), who, based on his studies of purple and green bacteria, demonstrated that photosynthesis is essentially a light-dependent reaction in which hydrogen from a suitable oxidisable compound reduces carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. This can be expressed by: Light 2H2 A + CO2 Ô£ßÔ£ßÔ£ßÔ£ßÔ£ß ‚Üí 2 A + CH2 O + H2 O
 In green plants H2O is the hydrogen donor and is oxidised to O2. Some organisms do not release O2 during photosynthesis. When H2S, instead is the hydrogen donor for purple and green sulphur bacteria, the ‚Äòoxidation‚Äô product is sulphur or sulphate depending on the organism and not O2. Hence, he inferred that the O2 evolved by the green plant comes from H2O, not from carbon dioxide. This was later proved by using radioisotopic techniques. The correct equation, that would represent the overall process of photosynthesis is therefore: Light 6CO2 + 12H2 O Ô£ßÔ£ßÔ£ßÔ£ßÔ£ß ‚Üí C6 H12 O6 + 6H2 O + 6O2

Explain the photochemical phase of photosyn-thesis. What is the light reaction product. ,"The photochemical phase : this phase of involve all those events which require sunlight. A photon absorbed by the molecules of the trapping or harvesting aone of P'S Iand PS II pass their energy to their respective reacion centre.  For pigment system 1 the light energy is gathered by cholorphyill a, and posibly by chlerophyll b, while for PS II ight energy is gathered by chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and phycobillins. Arnon et al (1954) discovered that in addition to carrying out Hill reaction the choloroplast also synthesize ATP in presence of light from ADP and inorganic phosphate. This process is called as photophosphorylation. ","Light reactions or the ‚ÄòPhotochemical‚Äô phase include light absorption, water splitting, oxygen Primary acceptor release, and the formation of high-energy chemical intermediates, ATP and NADPH. Several protein complexes are involved in the process. The pigments are organised into two discrete photochemical light harvesting complexes (LHC) within the Photosystem I (PS Reaction Photon I) and Photosystem II (PS II). These are named centre in the sequence of their discovery, and not in the sequence in which they function during the Pigment light reaction. The LHC are made up of molecules hundreds of pigment molecules bound to proteins. Each photosystem has all the pigments (except one molecule of chlorophyll a) forming a light harvesting system also called antennae Figure 13.4 The light harvesting complex (Figure 13.4). These pigments help to make photosynthesis more efficient by absorbing different wavelengths of light. The single chlorophyll a molecule forms the reaction centre. The reaction centre is different in both the photosystems. In PS I the reaction centre chlorophyll a has an absorption peak at 700 nm, hence is called P700, while in PS II it has absorption maxima at 680 nm, and is called P680.

(ii) The process initiates with excitation of special types of chlorophyll molecules P680 and P700 (The letter Pstands for pigment and the figures for the wavelength of light at which these molecules absorb). (iii) P 680 and P700, molecules of chlorophyll form the reaction centres or photocentres. (iv) The accessory pigments and other chlorophyll molecules harvest the solar energy and pass it on to the reaction centres. (v) Thus, a photon absorbed anywhere in the molecules harvest the solar energy and pass its on to the P680 molecule. (vi) The cluster of pigment molecules which transfer their energy to P 680 absorb at or below the wavelength of 680 nm. (vii) Together with P 680 they form the photosystem II or PS II. Similarly P700 forms photosystem I or PS I along with pigment molecules which absorb at or below 700 nm. (viii) When P680 acquires a sufficient quantum of energy, it emits an electron, This electron with high potential energy moves down an electron transport chain and during this process ATP is formed. (ix) The electron lost from P 680 is ultimately compensated by P700 which transfers it to ferredoxin (an iron-containing protein). In turn, ferredoxin transfers the electron to NADP to generate NADPH.

 ATP is synthesised by cells (in mitochondria and Photosystem I chloroplasts) is named phosphorylation. Photophosphorylation is the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate in the presence of e - acceptor light. When the two photosystems work in a Light series, first PS II and then the PS I, a process called non-cyclic photo-phosphorylation occurs.

While the membrane or lamellae of the grana have both PS I and PS II the stroma lamellae membranes lack PS II as well as NADP reductase enzyme. The excited electron does not pass on to NADP+ but is cycled back to the PS I complex through the electron transport chain (Figure 13.6). The cyclic flow hence, results only in the synthesis of ATP, but not of NADPH + H+. Cyclic photophosphorylation also occurs when only light of wavelengths beyond 680 nm are available for excitation.

Esplain chemiosmotic bypothests briefly.,"The chemiosmotic hypothesis has been put forward to explain thse machanism of ATP synthesis in the chloroplast, ATE synthests is linked to the development of pruton gradient actoss the membranes of the thylakoid. (i) Since splitting of the water molecule takes place on the inner side of the thylakoid membrane the protons produced by the photolysis of water accuimulates within the lumen of the thylakoids.  (ii) As electrons move through the photosystems, protons are transported across the membrane. (iii) This occur because the primary acceptor ot electron which is located towards the outer side of the membrane transfers its electrons to an hydrogen carrier. Hence this molecule removes a proton from the stroma while transporting an electron. (iv) When this molecule passes on its electron to the electron carrier on the inner side of the membrane, the proton is released into the lumen side of the membrane. (v) The NADP teductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the membrane. Along with electrons that come from the acceptor of electrons of PSl, protons are also needed to reduce NAD+ to NADPH + H + and so these protons are also removed from the stroma. (vi) As a result, protons in the stroma decrease in number, while in the lumen it increases, thus creating a proton gradient across the thy≈Çakoid membrane. (vi) This gradientis important because the breakdown of this gradient leads to release of energy. The gradient is broken down due to the facilitated diffusion of protons across the membrane to the stroma through F0 part of ATP ase. (vii) The other portion of ATP synthetase called F1 undergoes conformational change due to the energy produced by the breakdown of proton gradient which enables the enzyme to synthesize several ATP. ","ATP is synthesised by cells (in mitochondria and Photosystem I chloroplasts) is named phosphorylation.

 13.6.3 Chemiosmotic Hypothesis Let us now try and understand how actually ATP is synthesised in the chloroplast. The chemiosmotic hypothesis has been put forward to explain the mechanism. Like in respiration, in photosynthesis too, ATP synthesis is linked to development of a proton gradient across a membrane. This time these are the membranes of thylakoid. There is one difference though, here the proton accumulation is towards the inside of the membrane, i.e., in the lumen. In respiration, protons accumulate in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria when electrons move through the ETS (Chapter 14). Let us understand what causes the proton gradient across the membrane. We need to consider again the processes that take place during the activation of electrons and their transport to determine the steps that cause a proton gradient to develop (Figure 13.7). (a) Since splitting of the water molecule takes place on the inner side of the membrane, the protons or hydrogen ions that are produced by the splitting of water accumulate within the lumen of the thylakoids.

 Figure 13.7 ATP synthesis through chemiosmosis
 (b) As electrons move through the photosystems, protons are transported across the membrane. This happens because the primary accepter of electron which is located towards the outer side of the membrane transfers its electron not to an electron carrier but to an H carrier. Hence, this molecule removes a proton from the stroma while transporting an electron. When this molecule passes on its electron to the electron carrier on the inner side of the membrane, the proton is released into the inner side or the lumen side of the membrane. (c) The NADP reductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the membrane. Along with electrons that come from the acceptor of electrons of PS I, protons are necessary for the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH+ H+. These protons are also removed from the stroma. Hence, within the chloroplast, protons in the stroma decrease in number, while in the lumen there is accumulation of protons. This creates a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane as well as a measurable decrease in pH in the lumen. Why are we so interested in the proton gradient? This gradient is important because it is the breakdown of this gradient that leads to the synthesis of ATP. The gradient is broken down due to the movement of protons across the membrane to the stroma through the transmembrane

What is photorespiration 7 How do some plants like sugafcane minimize the photorespiratory loss? Explain  ,"Photorespiration : It is light dependent process of oxygenation of ribulose biphosphate (RuBP) and release of carbon dioxide by the photosynthetic organs of a plant. The photorespiratory losses are checked by sugarcane by having physiological adaptations The process of photosynthests occurs in mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells. Mesophyll cells : (i) Initially, CO2 in taken up by phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) and changed to oxaloacetate (OAA) in the presence of PEP carboxylase (PEPCO). (ii) Oxaloacetate is reduced to malate/aspartate, the product formed reach into bundle sheath. Bundle Sheath : (i) The oxidation of malate (an aspartate) occurs with release of carbon dioxide and formation of pyruvate (3C). (iii) Due to increased CO2 concentration, the RuBisco function as carboxylase and not as oxygenase. (iv) This prevents the photosynthetic losses.

What are the products of light reaction ? Name first stable product of C3 plants Explain different steps of calvin cycle.,"ATP and NADPH, the product of light reaction are used in synthesis of food. The first CO2 fixation product in C3 Plants is 3-phosphoglyceric acid. The CO2 acceptor is RuBP. Calvin cycle has three stages: (i) Carboxylation : CO2 + RuBP ‚Üí 2 molecule of PGA. (ii) Reduction : Glucose is formed at the expense of ATP and NADPH It involves 2 ATP for phosphorylation and 2 NADPH2 for reduction per CO2 molecule fixed. (iii) Regeneration : RuBP is formed again. 6 turns of Calvin cyde and 18 ATP molecules are required to synthesize one molecule of glucose For diagram: Refer to SAQ-IIL/Q.14.6 CO2 + 6RuBP + 18 ATP + 12NADPH-C6 H12 O6 + 6 RuBP + 18ADP +18Pi + 12NADP.","Sucrose, starch Figure 13.8 The Calvin cycle proceeds in three stages : (1) carboxylation, during which CO2 combines with ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate; (2) reduction, during which carbohydrate is formed at the expense of the photochemically made ATP and NADPH; and (3) regeneration during which the CO2 acceptor ribulose1,5-bisphosphate is formed again so that the cycle continues
 2. Reduction ‚Äì These are a series of reactions that lead to the formation of glucose. The steps involve utilisation of 2 molecules of ATP for phosphorylation and two of NADPH for reduction per CO2 molecule fixed. The fixation of six molecules of CO2 and 6 turns of the cycle are required for the formation of one molecule of glucose from the pathway. 3. Regeneration ‚Äì Regeneration of the CO2 acceptor molecule RuBP is crucial if the cycle is to continue uninterrupted. The regeneration steps require one ATP for phosphorylation to form RuBP.
 Hence for every CO2 molecule entering the Calvin cycle, 3 molecules of ATP and 2 of NADPH are required. It is probably to meet this difference in number of ATP and NADPH used in the dark reaction that the cyclic phosphorylation takes place. To make one molecule of glucose 6 turns of the cycle are required. Work out how many ATP and NADPH molecules will be required to make one molecule of glucose through the Calvin pathway. It might help you to understand all of this if we look at what goes in and what comes out of the Calvin cycle. In Six CO2 18 ATP 12 NADPH

What are the external and internal factors affecting photosynthesis ?,"The external and internal factors affecting photosynthesis are: (i) External factors: (a) Light : The quality, intensity and duration of light received by plants greatly influences the rate of photosynthesis. The quality of light influence the photosynthesis as blue and red regions of the visible spectrum are most effective. Green light has minimum effect. When sufficient intensity of light is available, they starts performing photosynthesis. Rate of photosynthesis increase proportionately with an increase in light intensity till plants achieve light saturation point. Beyond this point photosynthesis does show any change. Longer exposure to continuous light favours good photosynthesis. (b) Carbon dioxide : CO2 concentration in atmosphere act as a limiting factor. An increase in CO2 come upto 0.1% shows an increase in photosynthesis. Higher conc. becomes toxic and inhibit the rate of photosynthesis. (c) Oxygen : High concentration of usygen has an inhibitory effect on photosynthesis in C3 plants, because RuBP oxygenase becomes more active resulting in photorespiration. (d) Water: Its photooxidation supplies H + for the reduction of NADP. The reduced NADP H2 is used in the reduction of CO2 in Calvin cycle. It also donates the electrons to P680 in non-cyclic photophosphorylation. (e) Temperature: Rate of photosynthesis doubles with every 100 C rise in temperature till the optimum value is achieved. An increase in temperature above 300 C results in a fall in the rate of photosynthesis. The optimum temperature for photosynthesis in C3 plants is 10-2 50 C and in C4 plants it is 30450 C. (ii) Internal factors:  (a) Chlorophyll content: Chlorophyll is essential for cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation and reduction of NADP, the ssimilatory power, used to fix and reduce CO2 in Calvin cycle. (b) Leaf anatomy: The important anatomical features that influence photosynthesis include thickness of cuticle, stomatal index, distribution of stomata, degree of opening of stomata, size and distribution of intercellular spaces and number and distribution of vascular strands. Kranz anatomy of C4 plants increases the efficiency of photosynthesis. (c) Age of leaf: As leaf develops, the rate of its photosynthesis increases gradually reaching maximum when the leaf becomes fully matured. Rate of photosynthesis decreases with age of leaf.","13.10 FACTORS AFFECTING PHOTOSYNTHESIS
 Rate of photosynthesis
 An understanding of the factors that affect photosynthesis is necessary. The rate of photosynthesis is very important in determining the yield of plants including crop plants. Photosynthesis is under the influence of several factors, both internal (plant) and external. The plant factors include the number, size, age and orientation of leaves, mesophyll cells and chloroplasts, internal CO2 concentration and the amount of chlorophyll. The plant or internal factors are dependent on the genetic predisposition and the growth of the plant. The external factors would include the availability of sunlight, temperature, CO2 concentration and water. As a plant photosynthesises, all these factors will simultaneously affect its rate. Hence, though several factors interact and simultaneously affect photosynthesis or CO2 fixation, usually one factor is the major cause or is the one that limits the rate. Hence, at any point the rate will be determined by the factor available at sub-optimal levels. When several factors affect any [bio] chemical process, Blackman‚Äôs (1905) Law of Limiting Factors comes into effect. This states the following: If a chemical process is affected by more than one factor, then its rate will be determined by the factor which is nearest to its minimal value: it is the factor which directly affects the process if its quantity is changed. For example, despite the presence of a green leaf and optimal light and CO2 conditions, the plant may not photosynthesise if the temperature is very low. This leaf, if given the optimal temperature, will start photosynthesising.

How is CAM completed in two phases ? Explain.,"Crassulacean acid metabolism occurs in succulent plants and gets completed in two phases: Phase 1: (i) Stomata are open at night.

(iii) It is decarboxylated with the help of malic enzyme. (iii) Pyruvate is produced and is metabolised.  (iv) The released CO2 is fixed again through Calvin cycle with the help of RuBP and Rubisco. (v) Crassulacean plants have developed a unique mechanism to perform photosynthesis without much lose of water.","and then succinyl-CoA. In the remaining steps of citric acid cycle, succinyl-CoA is oxidised to OAA allowing the cycle to continue. During the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinic acid a molecule of GTP is synthesised. This is a substrate level phosphorylation. In a coupled reaction GTP is converted to GDP with the simultaneous synthesis of ATP from ADP. Also there are three points in the cycle where NAD+ is reduced to NADH + H+ and one point where FAD + is reduced to FADH 2 . The continued oxidation of acetyl CoA via the TCA cycle requires the continued replenishment of oxaloacetic acid, the first member of the cycle. In addition it also requires regeneration of NAD+ and FAD+ from NADH and FADH2 respectively. The summary equation for this phase of respiration may be written as follows:

This is the reaction where RuBP combines with CO2 to form 2 molecules of 3PGA, that is catalysed by RuBisCO. RuBisCo ‚Üí 2 √ó 3PGA RuBP + CO2 Ô£ßÔ£ßÔ£ßÔ£ßÔ£ßÔ£ß
 RuBisCO that is the most abundant enzyme in the world (Do you wonder why?) is characterised by the fact that its active site can bind to both CO2 and O2 ‚Äì hence the name. Can you think how this could be possible? RuBisCO has a much greater affinity for CO2 when the CO2: O2 is nearly equal. Imagine what would happen if this were not so! This binding is competitive. It is the relative concentration of O2 and CO2 that determines which of the two will bind to the enzyme. In C3 plants some O2 does bind to RuBisCO, and hence CO2 fixation is decreased. Here the RuBP instead of being converted to 2 molecules of PGA binds with O2 to form one molecule of phosphoglycerate and phosphoglycolate (2 Carbon) in a pathway called photorespiration. In the photorespiratory pathway, there is neither synthesis of sugars, nor of ATP. Rather it results in the release of CO2 with the utilisation of ATP. In the photorespiratory pathway there is no synthesis of ATP or NADPH. The biological function of photorespiration is not known yet. In C4 plants photorespiration does not occur. This is because they have a mechanism that increases the concentration of CO2 at the enzyme site. This takes place when the C4 acid from the mesophyll is broken down in the bundle sheath cells to release CO2 ‚Äì this results in increasing the intracellular concentration of CO2. In turn, this ensures that the RuBisCO functions as a carboxylase minimising the oxygenase activity. Now that you know that the C4 plants lack photorespiration, you probably can understand why productivity and yields are better in these plants. In addition these plants show tolerance to higher temperatures. Based on the above discussion can you compare plants showing the C3 and the C4 pathway? Use the table format given and fill in the information.

Where does glycolysis occur in cell? Describe the sequence of reactions in it. Mention the end product. ,"Glycolysis: Glycolysis means ""the splitting of sugar"". A glucose molecule is converted into 2 molecules of pyruvic acid during glycolysis. It occurs in cytoplasm of the cell. Sequence of reactions is Glycolysis: Step 1: The enzyme hexokinase phosphorylates (adds a phosphate group to) glucose in the cell's cytoplasm. In the process, a phosphate group from ATP is transferred to glucose producing glucose 6-phosphate.  Step 2: The enzyme phosphohexo seisomerase converts glucose 6-phosphate into its isomer fructose 6-phosphate.  Step 3: The enzyme phosphofructokinase uses another ATP molecule to transfer a phosphate group to from fructose 1, 6-phosphate. Step 4: The enzyme aldolase splits fructose 1, 6 bisphosphate into two sugars that are isomers of each other. These two sugars are dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde phosphate.  Step 5: The enzyme triose phosphate isomerase rapidly inter-converts the molecules dihydroxyacetone phosphate into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is removed as soon as it is formed to be used in the next step of glycolysis.  Step 6: The enzyme triose phosphate dehydrogenase serves two functions in this step. First the enzyme transfers a hydrogen (H-) from glyceraldehyde phosphate to the oxidizing agent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) to form NADH. Next triose phosphate dehydrogenase adds a phosphate (P) from the cytosol to the oxidized glyceraldehyde phosphate to form 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate. This occurs for both molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced in step 5.  Step 7: The enzyme phosphoglycerokinase transfers a P from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to a molecule of ADP to form ATP This happens for each molecule of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. The process yields two 3-phosphoglycerate molecules and two ATP molecules. Step 8: The enzyme phosphoglyceromutase relocates the P from 3-phosphoglycerate from the third carbon to the second carbon to form 2-phosphoglycerate.  Step 9: The enzyme enolase removes a molecule of water from 2- phosphoglycerate to form phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). This happens for  Step 10: The enzyme pyruvate kinase transfers a P from PEP to ADP to form pyruvate and ATP. This happens for each molecule of phosphoenolpyruvate + pyruvate kinase+2 ADP2 molecules of pyruvate +2ATP. End products are 2 pyruvate molecules and 2 ATP molecules. ","14.2 GLYCOLYSIS The term glycolysis has originated from the Greek words, glycos for sugar, and lysis for splitting. The scheme of glycolysis was given by Gustav Embden, Otto Meyerhof, and J. Parnas, and is often referred to as the EMP pathway. In anaerobic organisms, it is the only process in respiration. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and is present in all living organisms. In this process, glucose undergoes partial oxidation to form two molecules of pyruvic acid. In plants, this glucose is derived from sucrose, which is the end product of photosynthesis, or from storage

What is pentose phosphate pathway? Explain the process.,"(i) It is also called as hexose monophosphate shunt, because this pathway occurs in presence of oxygen, and involves direct oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate.  (ii) In PPP for every six molecules of glucose, one is completely oxidised to CO 2 and H2O, while the other five are regenerated. Oxidation of glucose is linked to the formation of NADPH2. (iii) Glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate by ATP. (iv) Glucose 6-PO4 undergoes two dehydrogenation through a number of intermediates to yield ribulose-5-phosphate, two molecules of NADPH + H+ and a molecule of CO 2. (v) Complete oxidation of a molecule of glucose produces 12 molecules of NADPH+H +, which is equivalent to 36 ATP molecules. (vi) Thus, the energy released in the oxidation of glucose via this pathway is almost equal to that of common pathway that liberates 38 ATP molecules per molecule of glucose. Pentose phosphate pathway occurs in cytoplasm but takes the help of mitochondria for producing ATP.  ","carbohydrates. Sucrose is converted into glucose and fructose by the enzyme, invertase, and these two monosaccharides readily enter the glycolytic pathway. Glucose and fructose are phosphorylated to give rise to glucose-6phosphate by the activity of the enzyme hexokinase. This phosphorylated form of glucose then isomerises to produce fructose-6phosphate. Subsequent steps of metabolism of glucose and fructose are same. The various steps of glycolysis are depicted in Figure 14.1. In glycolysis, a chain of ten reactions, under the control of different enzymes, takes place to produce pyruvate from glucose. While studying the steps of glycolysis, please note the steps at which utilisation or synthesis of ATP or (in this case) NADH + H+ take place. ATP is utilised at two steps: first in the conversion of glucose into glucose 6-phosphate and second in the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate. The fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate is split into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL). We find that there is one step where NADH + H+ is formed from NAD + ; this is when 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) is converted to 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPGA). Two redox-equivalents are removed (in the form of two hydrogen atoms) from PGAL and transferred to a molecule of NAD+. PGAL is oxidised and with inorganic phosphate to get converted into BPGA. The conversion of BPGA to 3-phosphoglyceric acid (PGA), is also an energy yielding process; this energy is trapped by the formation of ATP. Another ATP is synthesised during the conversion of PEP to pyruvic acid. Can you then calculate how many ATP molecules are directly synthesised in this pathway from one glucose molecule? Pyruvic acid is then the key product of glycolysis. What is the metabolic fate of pyruvate? This depends on the cellular need.

Name and explain the three stages of cell cycle associated with interphase.  Describe the phases of cell cycle with suitable diagram.    Explain the events occurring during the cell cycle of a somatic cell. ,"Cell cycle : The three stages of cell cycle are :(i) G 1 phase, (ii) G2 phase, (ii) s phase or synthesis phase and (iii) G2 phase. The resting stage or stage between two mitotic divisions (that is at the end of prophase and beginning of prophase) is called interphase. The interphase is the longest part of mitotic cycle taking a long time for its completion. It itself consists of three phases: (i) G1 Phase : (Post-Mitotic Gap 1) (a) It includes synthesis and organization of the substrate and enzyme necessary for DNA synthesis. (b) It is marked by the transcription of r-RNA, t-RNA, m-RNA and synthesis of different protein. (c) Enlargement of nucleus. (d) Pooling of nucleotide and protein from the neighbouring cell into dividing cell. (e) The chromosomes lie in the form of more or less loosely coiled thread. (ii) S-Phase (Synthetic phase): (a) The chromosome replicate and the DNA content doubles. Each chromosome comes to have two chromatin thread. (iii) G2 Phase (Pre-Mitotic Gap 2): (a) It is the stage when rate and amount of protein synthesis is maximum. (b) It is the post DNA synthesis phase during which all the metabolic activities concerning growth of cytoplasm and its constituent cell organelle and macro-molecules are formed. (c) Highly extended coiling of chromosome marks starting of prophase. ","10.1.1 Phases of Cell Cycle
 The M Phase represents the phase when the actual cell division or mitosis occurs and the interphase represents the phase between two successive M phases. It is significant to note Figure 10.1 A diagrammatic view of cell cycle indicating formation of two cells that in the 24 hour average duration of cell from one cell cycle of a human cell, cell division proper lasts for only about an hour. The interphase lasts more than 95% of the duration of cell cycle. The M Phase starts with the nuclear division, corresponding to the separation of daughter chromosomes (karyokinesis) and usually ends with division of cytoplasm (cytokinesis). The interphase, though called the resting phase, is the time during which the cell is preparing for division by undergoing both cell growth and DNA replication in an orderly manner. The interphase is divided into three further phases: l
 The stages through which a cell passes from one division to the next is called the cell cycle. Cell cycle is divided into two phases called (i) Interphase ‚Äì a period of preparation for cell division, and (ii) Mitosis (M phase) ‚Äì the actual period of cell division. Interphase is further subdivided into G 1, S and G2. G 1 phase is the period when the cell grows and carries out normal metabolism. Most of the organelle duplication also occurs during this phase. S phase marks the phase of DNA replication and chromosome duplication. G2 phase is the period of cytoplasmic growth. Mitosis is also divided into four stages namely prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. Chromosome condensation occurs during prophase. Simultaneously, the centrioles move to the opposite poles. The nuclear envelope and the nucleolus disappear and the spindle fibres start appearing. Metaphase is marked by the alignment of chromosomes at the equatorial plate. During anaphase the centromeres divide and the chromatids start moving towards the two opposite poles. Once the chromatids reach the two poles, the chromosomal elongation starts, nucleolus and the nuclear membrane reappear. This stage is called the telophase. Nuclear division is then followed by the cytoplasmic division and is called cytokinesis. Mitosis thus, is the equational division in which the chromosome number of the parent is conserved in the daughter cell. In contrast to mitosis, meiosis occurs in the diploid cells, which are destined to form gametes. It is called the reduction division since it reduces the chromosome number by half while making the gametes. In sexual reproduction when the two gametes fuse the chromosome number is restored to the value in the parent. Meiosis is divided into two phases ‚Äì meiosis I and meiosis II. In the first meiotic division the homologous chromosomes pair to form bivalents, and undergo crossing over. Meiosis I has a long prophase, which is divided further into five phases. These are leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene and diakinesis. During metaphase I the bivalents arrange on the equatorial plate. This is followed by anaphase I in which homologous chromosomes move to the opposite poles with both their chromatids. Each pole receives half the chromosome number of the parent cell. In telophase I, the nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear. Meiosis II is similar to mitosis. During anaphase II the sister chromatids separate. Thus at the end of meiosis four haploid cells are formed.
 "
Enumerate the events that occur in mitosis of cell division with diagram.,"Mitosis is divided into the following four stages: (i) Prophase: (a) Chromatin material shortens and condenses into thread like structures called chromosomes. (b) Each chromosome consists of two chromatids joined at a point called centromere. (c) At the end of the prophase, the nucleolus and nuclear membrane disappear. The cellular protein content condenses into a spindle.  (ii) Metaphase: (a) A bipolar, anastral spindle develops in the cell (b) The chromosomes appear short and thick., each having two chromatids.  (c) The chromatids become clear and get attached to the poles by spindle fibres at their centromeres. (d) Chromosomes become arranged at the equator of the spindle. (iii) Anaphase: (a) The centromeres split into two and the fibres pull the daughter centromeres to the opposite poles. (b) The daughter chromosomes (with separated chromatids) appear V, J, L and I shaped depending upon the position of centromere. (iv) Telophase: (a) The chromosomes reach the poles of the cell, uncoil, lengthen and lose the ability to be seen clearly. (b) The spindle fibres disintegrate. (c) Nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear and two daughter nuclei appear at opposite poles (v) Karyokinesis is followed by cytokinesis where the following events takes place: (a) Cell plate formation takes place between the two daughter nuclei. (b) Two daughter cells are formed. ","The stages through which a cell passes from one division to the next is called the cell cycle. Cell cycle is divided into two phases called (i) Interphase ‚Äì a period of preparation for cell division, and (ii) Mitosis (M phase) ‚Äì the actual period of cell division. Interphase is further subdivided into G 1, S and G2. G 1 phase is the period when the cell grows and carries out normal metabolism. Most of the organelle duplication also occurs during this phase. S phase marks the phase of DNA replication and chromosome duplication. G2 phase is the period of cytoplasmic growth.

(i) Write a note on significance of meiosis. (ii) Differentiate between anaphase I of meiosis and Anaphase of mitosis. (iii) What do you understand by Synapsis? In which stage of Prophase-I you observe it. ,"(i) Formation of gametes, Genetic variability Maintenance of chromosomal number (ii) Anaphase of mitosis Centromeres and chromatids separate; chromatids moves to opposite poles due to shortening of spindle fibres. Anaphase I of meiosis: Homologous chromosomes separate while chromatids remain associated at their centromeres. (iii) Pairing of homologous chomosomes is synapsis. It is observed during zygotene stage.","10.2.3 Anaphase At the onset of anaphase, each chromosome arranged at the metaphase plate is split simultaneously and the two daughter chromatids, now referred to as daughter chromosomes of the future daughter nuclei, begin their migration towards the two opposite poles. As each chromosome moves away from the equatorial plate, the centromere of each chromosome remains directed towards the pole and hence at the leading edge, with the arms of the chromosome trailing behind Figure 10.2 a and b : A diagrammatic (Figure 10.2 c). Thus, anaphase stage is characterised by view of stages in mitosis
 Anaphase I: The homologous chromosomes separate, while sister chromatids remain associated at their centromeres (Figure 10.3). Telophase I: The nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear, cytokinesis follows and this is called as dyad of cells (Figure 10.3). Although in many cases the chromosomes do undergo some dispersion, they do not reach the extremely extended state of the interphase nucleus. The stage between the two meiotic divisions is called interkinesis and is generally short lived. There is no replication of DNA during interkinesis. Interkinesis is followed by prophase II, a much simpler prophase than prophase I.
 10.4.2 Meiosis II Prophase II: Meiosis II is initiated immediately after cytokinesis, usually before the chromosomes have fully elongated. In contrast to meiosis I, meiosis II resembles a normal mitosis. The nuclear membrane disappears by the end of prophase II (Figure 10.4). The chromosomes again become compact. Metaphase II: At this stage the chromosomes align at the equator and the microtubules from opposite poles of the spindle get attached to the kinetochores (Figure 10.4) of sister chromatids. Anaphase II: It begins with the simultaneous splitting of the centromere of each chromosome (which was holding the sister chromatids together), allowing them to move toward opposite poles of the cell (Figure 10.4) by shortening of microtubules attached to kinetochores.

How many types of meiosis are there ? Explain.,"Depending upon the stage, when meiosis occurs, the meiosis is of three types : Gametic, zygotic and sporic. (i) Gametic or terminal meiosis : In most animals and some lower plants, meiosis takes place during the formation of gametes (gametogenesis). Such a meiosis is described as gametic or terminal meiosis. When two gametes fuse in fertilization, the diploid zygote is formed. Gametic meiosis results in diplontic life cycle. (ii) Zygotic or initial meiosis: In some lower plants meiosis takes place in the zygote and the resulting organisms are haploid. It is called zygotic or initial meiosis. Organisms having zygotic meiosis have haplontic life cycle. (iii) Sporic or intermediate meiosis: In most of the plants, meiosis occurs at the time of sporogenesis. It is called sporic or intermediate meiosis. Spore gives rise to a new gametophytic phase in the life cycle. The gametophyte produces gametes. The life of plant is said to be diplo-haplontic because of the presence of diploid and haploid multicellular phases.","In plants, both haploid and diploid cells can divide by mitosis. This ability leads to the formation of different A plant bodies - haploid and diploid. The haploid plant Gametogenesis body produces gametes by mitosis. This plant body B represents a gametophyte. Following fertilisation the Haplontic zygote also divides by mitosis to produce a diploid sporophytic plant body. Haploid spores are produced by this plant body by meiosis. These in turn, divide by mitosis to form a haploid plant body once again. Thus, (a) Gametophyte during the life cycle of any sexually reproducing plant, (n) there is an alternation of generations between gamete producing haploid gametophyte and spore producing diploid sporophyte. However, different plant groups, as well as individuals representing them, differ in the following patterns: 1. Sporophytic generation is represented only by the one-celled zygote. There are no free-living sporophytes. Meiosis in the zygote results in the formation of haploid spores. The haploid spores divide mitotically and form the gametophyte. The dominant, photosynthetic phase in such plants is the free-living gametophyte. This kind of life cycle is termed as haplontic. Many algae such as Volvox, Spirogyra and some species of Chlamydomonas represent this pattern (Figure 3.7 a). Sporophyte 2. On the other extreme, is the type wherein the diploid (2n) Zygote sporophyte is the dominant, photosynthetic, (2n) independent phase of the plant. The gametophytic Syn A gam phase is represented by the single to few-celled y haploid gametophyte. This kind of life cycle is Meiosis termed as diplontic. An alga, Fucus sp., represents Gametogenesis Haplo-diplontic this pattern (Fig. 3.7b). In addition, all seed bearing B Spores plants i.e., gymnosperms and angiosperms, follow (n) this pattern with some variations, wherein, the gametophytic phase is few to multi-celled. (c) Gametophyte 3. Bryophytes and pteridophytes, interestingly, exhibit (n) an intermediate condition (Haplo-diplontic); both phases are multicellular. However, they differ in their Figure 3.7 Life cycle patterns : (a) Haplontic (b) Diplontic (c) Haplo-diplontic dominant phases. y
 10.4 MEIOSIS The production of offspring by sexual reproduction includes the fusion of two gametes, each with a complete haploid set of chromosomes. Gametes are formed from specialised diploid cells. This specialised kind of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half results in the production of haploid daughter cells. This kind of division is called meiosis. Meiosis ensures the production of haploid phase in the life cycle of sexually reproducing organisms whereas fertilisation restores the diploid phase. We come across meiosis during gametogenesis in plants and animals. This leads to the formation of haploid gametes. The key features of meiosis are as follows: l l l
 l
 Meiosis involves two sequential cycles of nuclear and cell division called meiosis I and meiosis II but only a single cycle of DNA replication. Meiosis I is initiated after the parental chromosomes have replicated to produce identical sister chromatids at the S phase. Meiosis involves pairing of homologous chromosomes and recombination between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. Four haploid cells are formed at the end of meiosis II. Meiotic events can be grouped under the following phases: Meiosis I

Describe briefly the two phases of meiotic division.   ,"Two phases of meiotic division: (i) Meiotic cell division is divided into two phasesMeiosis I and Meiosis II. (ii) In the meiotic I division, the homologous chromosomes pair to form bivalents. Exchange of genetic material takes place. (iii) The chromosomes now separate and get distributed into daughter cells. (iv) Prophase I is divided into five sub-stages : Leptotene, Zygotene, Pachytene, Diplotene and Diakinesis. (v) During Metaphase I, the bivalents get arranged on equatorial plate with their arms on the plate but the centromere is directed towards opposite pole. It is followed by Anaphase I.  (vi) Now the homologous chromosomes repel each other, and move to the opposite poles with both their chromatids. (vii) In this way each pole gets half the chromosomes number of the parent cell. (viii) In telophase I, the nuclear envelope and nucleolus again appear. Meiosis II is quite similar to mitosis. (ix) The centromere of each chromosome breaks, separating the chromatids, one each to a daughter cell.  (x) The meiotic cell division maintains the chromosome number of a species. (xi) As a result of meiotic division, the four daughter cells are formed with half the chromosome number (haploid) in each cell.","Anaphase I: The homologous chromosomes separate, while sister chromatids remain associated at their centromeres (Figure 10.3). Telophase I: The nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear, cytokinesis follows and this is called as dyad of cells (Figure 10.3). Although in many cases the chromosomes do undergo some dispersion, they do not reach the extremely extended state of the interphase nucleus. The stage between the two meiotic divisions is called interkinesis and is generally short lived. There is no replication of DNA during interkinesis.

 The stages through which a cell passes from one division to the next is called the cell cycle. Cell cycle is divided into two phases called (i) Interphase ‚Äì a period of preparation for cell division, and (ii) Mitosis (M phase) ‚Äì the actual period of cell division. Interphase is further subdivided into G 1, S and G2. G 1 phase is the period when the cell grows and carries out normal metabolism. Most of the organelle duplication also occurs during this phase. S phase marks the phase of DNA replication and chromosome duplication. G2 phase is the period of cytoplasmic growth.

What is the significance of meiosis?,Significance of Meiosis: (i) Formation of gametes: Meiosis produces gametes that are essential for sexual reproduction. (ii) Maintenance of chromosome number: Meiosis maintains the chromosome number constant in sexually reproducing organisms. It is essential since the chromosome number is doubled after fertilization. (iii) Introduction of variation: Meiosis introduces variation in the organisms due to crossing over and random distribution of paternal and maternal chromosomes. (iv) Mutations: Chromosomal and genomatic: mutations can take place by irregularities of meiotic divisions. Some of the mutations may be advantageous to the organism and are perpetuated by natural selection. (v) Genetic information: It switches on genetic information for the development of gametes or gametophyte and switches off the sporophytic information. (vi) Evidence of basic relationship of organisms: Details of meiosis are essentially similar in the majority of organisms showing their basic similarities and relationship,"Significance of Mitosis
 Mitosis or the equational division is usually restricted to the diploid cells only. However, in some lower plants and in some social insects haploid cells also divide by mitosis. It is very essential to understand the significance of this division in the life of an organism. Are you aware of some examples where you have studied about haploid and diploid insects? Mitosis usually results in the production of diploid daughter cells with identical genetic complement. The growth of multicellular organisms is due to mitosis. Cell growth results in disturbing the ratio between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. It therefore becomes essential for the cell to divide to restore the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio. A very significant contribution of mitosis is cell repair. The cells of the upper layer of the epidermis, cells of the lining of the gut, and blood cells are being constantly replaced. Mitotic divisions in the meristematic tissues ‚Äì the apical and the lateral cambium, result in a continuous growth of plants throughout their life.
 10.4 MEIOSIS The production of offspring by sexual reproduction includes the fusion of two gametes, each with a complete haploid set of chromosomes. Gametes are formed from specialised diploid cells. This specialised kind of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half results in the production of haploid daughter cells. This kind of division is called meiosis. Meiosis ensures the production of haploid phase in the life cycle of sexually reproducing organisms whereas fertilisation restores the diploid phase. We come across meiosis during gametogenesis in plants and animals. This leads to the formation of haploid gametes. The key features of meiosis are as follows: l l l
 MEIOSIS
 Meiosis is the mechanism by which conservation of specific chromosome number of each species is achieved across generations in sexually reproducing organisms, even though the process, per se, paradoxically, results in reduction of chromosome number by half. It also increases the genetic variability in the population of organisms from one generation to the next. Variations are very important for the process of evolution.

Describe the sub-phases of prophase I of meiosis I    Describe prophase-I in detail with diagrams.   ,"Prophase I of meiosis I : It is more complicated and prolonged as compared to the similar stag of mitosis. It may be divided into the five sub- phases (i) Leptotene or leptonema: (a) It is the first stage of meiotic division following the interphase. (b) The chromatin fibres of interphase nucleus gets shorten and elongated, chromosomes become clear. (ii) Zygotene or zygonema: (a) The homologous chromosomes come to lie side by side and get attached laterally due to the development of nucleoprotein between them. This pairing of homologous chromosomes is called synapsis or syndesis. (d) On account of synapsis, chromosomes form pairs or bivalent. The number of bivalents is half number of the chromosomes. (iii) Pachytene or pachynema: (a) The paired chromosomes or bivalent become short and thick. The chromatids of each paired chromosome slightly separate and become visible. Thus, each bivalent or chromosome pair is made up of actually four chromatids, two of each chromosome. (b) Each group of four chromatids, is referred as tetrad. During pachytene, exchange of the corresponding segments of non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes, occurs. This process is called crossing over. (c) After crossing over, the two chromatids of a chromosome become dissimilar.  (iv) Diplotene or Diplonema : (a) The nucleoprotein fusion complex of the synapsed chromosomes dissolves. (b) The homologous chromosomes tart separating except in the region of crossing over. (c) The points of attachment between the homologous chromosomes are called chiasmata. (v) Diakinesis: (a) This is marked by terminalisation of chiasmata. During this phase the chromosomes are fully condensed and the meiotic spindle is assembled to prepare the homologous chromosomes for separation. The nucleolus/ nucleoli disappear and Nuclear envelope breaks down into vesicles. ","10.4.1 Meiosis I Prophase I: Prophase of the first meiotic division is typically longer and more complex when compared to prophase of mitosis. It has been further subdivided into the following five phases based on chromosomal behaviour, i.e., Leptotene, Zygotene, Pachytene, Diplotene and Diakinesis. During leptotene stage the chromosomes become gradually visible under the light microscope. The compaction of chromosomes continues throughout leptotene. This is followed by the second stage of prophase I called zygotene. During this stage chromosomes start pairing together and this process of association is called synapsis. Such paired chromosomes are called homologous chromosomes. Electron micrographs of this stage indicate that chromosome synapsis is accompanied by the formation of complex structure called synaptonemal complex. The complex formed by a pair of synapsed homologous chromosomes is called a bivalent or a tetrad. However, these are more clearly visible at the next stage. The first two stages of prophase I are relatively short-lived compared to the next stage that is pachytene. During this stage, the four chromatids of each bivalent chromosomes becomes distinct and clearly appears as tetrads. This stage is characterised by the appearance of recombination nodules, the sites at which crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids of the homologous chromosomes. Crossing over is the exchange of genetic material between two homologous chromosomes. Crossing over is also an enzyme-mediated process and the enzyme involved is called recombinase. Crossing over leads to recombination of genetic material on the two chromosomes. Recombination between homologous chromosomes is completed by the end of pachytene, leaving the chromosomes linked at the sites of crossing over. The beginning of diplotene is recognised by the dissolution of the synaptonemal complex and the tendency of the recombined homologous chromosomes of the bivalents to separate from each other except at the sites of crossovers. These X-shaped structures, are called chiasmata. In oocytes of some vertebrates, diplotene can last for months or years. The final stage of meiotic prophase I is diakinesis. This is marked by terminalisation of chiasmata. During this phase the chromosomes are fully condensed and the meiotic spindle is assembled to prepare the homologous chromosomes for separation. By the end of diakinesis, the nucleolus disappears and the nuclear envelope also breaks down. Diakinesis represents transition to metaphase. Metaphase I: The bivalent chromosomes align on the equatorial plate (Figure 10.3). The microtubules from the opposite poles of the spindle attach to the kinetochore of homologous chromosomes.
 Anaphase I: The homologous chromosomes separate, while sister chromatids remain associated at their centromeres (Figure 10.3). Telophase I: The nuclear membrane and nucleolus reappear, cytokinesis follows and this is called as dyad of cells (Figure 10.3). Although in many cases the chromosomes do undergo some dispersion, they do not reach the extremely extended state of the interphase nucleus. The stage between the two meiotic divisions is called interkinesis and is generally short lived. There is no replication of DNA during interkinesis. Interkinesis is followed by prophase II, a much simpler prophase than prophase I.
 10.4.2 Meiosis II Prophase II: Meiosis II is initiated immediately after cytokinesis, usually before the chromosomes have fully elongated. In contrast to meiosis I, meiosis II resembles a normal mitosis. The nuclear membrane disappears by the end of prophase II (Figure 10.4). The chromosomes again become compact. Metaphase II: At this stage the chromosomes align at the equator and the microtubules from opposite poles of the spindle get attached to the kinetochores (Figure 10.4) of sister chromatids. Anaphase II: It begins with the simultaneous splitting of the centromere of each chromosome (which was holding the sister chromatids together), allowing them to move toward opposite poles of the cell (Figure 10.4) by shortening of microtubules attached to kinetochores.
 "
Explain meiosis II in an animal cell.,"Meiosis II happen in the two haploid nuclei simultaneously. (i) Prophase II: It takes short time. Spindle formation begins and the chromosomes become short. Two chromatids are joined to a single centromere. Nuclear membrane and nucleolus disintegrate. (ii) Metaphase II : At the equator, the chromosomes lie and spindle is formed. The centromere of every chromosome is joined to the spindle fibre. Then centromere also divides. (iii) Anaphase II : The daughter chromosomes are formed. Chromatids move towards their poles with the spindle fibres.  (iv) Telophase II: Reaching at the poles chromosomes form nuclei which are haploid (N) daughter nuclei. Again nuclear membrane is constructed. Nucleolus is clearly visible.  Cytokinesis: The cytokinesis occurs and four daughter cells are formed which are haploid (N). It may occur once or twice (i.e., in Meiosis I and Meiosis or only after the meiosis ‚Ö° cell division).

Explain the structure of human lungs in detail.,"(i) The lungs are soft, spongy and elastic organs, pinkish in colour. (ii) The upper most portion of lungs is called the apex and the inferior portion is called the base. (iii) The left lung is smaller than the right lung. (iv) Each lung is enclosed by two membranes called the ùëùùëôùëíùë¢ùëüùëé. (v) The outer membrane is called parietal pleura and the inner membrane is known as visceral pleura. (vi) A narrow space between the two pleura is filled with pleural fluid. (vii) The left lung has two lobes: superior and inferior lobes. (viii) The right lung has three lobes: superior, middle and inferior lobe. (ix) The trachea at its lower bifurcates into a pair of primary bronchi which enter the right and left lungs. (x) As soon as primary branches enters each lung it divides to form secondary bronchi.  (xi) These bronchi also have cartilaginous rings. (xii) The tertiary bronchi sub-divides into smaller branches, the bronchioles. (xiii) Each terminal bronchioles give rise to a number of very thin, irregular walled and vascularised bag like structures called alveoli.  Fig. Tracheal division upto tertiary bronchi","17.1.1 Human Respiratory System We have a pair of external nostrils opening out above the upper lips. It leads to a nasal chamber through the nasal passage. The nasal chamber opens into the pharynx, a portion of which is the common passage for food and air. The pharynx opens through the larynx region into the trachea. Larynx is a cartilaginous box which helps in sound production and hence called the sound box. During swallowing glottis can be covered by a thin elastic cartilaginous flap called epiglottis to prevent the entry of food into the larynx. Trachea is a straight tube extending up to the mid-thoracic cavity, which divides at the level of 5th thoracic vertebra into a right and left primary bronchi. Each bronchi undergoes repeated divisions to form the secondary and tertiary bronchi and bronchioles ending up in very thin terminal bronchioles. The tracheae, primary, secondary and tertiary bronchi, and initial bronchioles are supported by incomplete cartilaginous rings. Each terminal bronchiole gives rise to a number of very thin, irregular-walled and vascularised bag-like structures called alveoli. The branching network of bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli comprise the lungs (Figure 17.1). We have two lungs which are covered by a double layered pleura, with pleural fluid between them. It reduces friction on the lung-surface. The outer pleural membrane is in close contact with the thoracic Epiglottis Larynx Trachea

Why is it not healthy to breath in a closed room in winters where a large number of persons are sitting near an angithi ?,In a closed room there is no provision of fresh air coming into the room. The oxygen already present in the air of that room shall be gradually consumed. Moreover if more number of people are sitting in that room the percentage of oxygen will go on decreasing and the percentage of carbon dioxide will go on increasing by continuous use of oxygen during respiration. If in such a room there is angithi also then it is positively harmful for the persons sitting in the room. It is because burning of coal or wood in the angithi would consume oxygen very rapidly. Also it produce poisonous gases like carbon monoxide in addition to carbon dioxide.,"BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASES

Give a detail account on respiratory capacities.,"The quantities of air the lungs can receive, hold or expel under different conditions are called pulmonary volumes. Many pulmonary volumes are collectively known as respiratory capacities. (i) Inspiratory Capacity (IC): It is the total volume of air that can be inhaled after a normal expiration. It includes tidal volume plus the inspiratory reserve volume. (IC = TV + IRV). It is normal about 3000 to 3500 ml of air. (ii) Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) : When a person breathes normally the amount which remains in the lung after normal expiration is called functional residual capacity. It is  the sum total of residual volume and the expiratory reserve volume (FRC RV+ERV). It is about 2500 ml of air. (iii) Vital Capacity (VC) : It is the amount of air which one can inhale and exhale after a forced expiration and after a forced inspiration respectively. It varies from 3.5-4.5 litres in a normal adult person. It is the sum total of TV, IRV and ERV. (iv) Total Lung Capacity (TLC): It is the total amount of air present in the lungs, and the respiratory passage after a maximum inspiration. It is the sum of the vital capacity and the residual volume. (TLC = VC + RV). It is 5000 to 6000 ml.","sternum causing an increase in the volume of the thoracic chamber in the dorso-ventral axis. The overall increase in the thoracic volume causes a similar increase in pulmonary volume. An increase in pulmonary volume decreases the intra-pulmonary pressure to less than the atmospheric pressure which forces the air from outside to move into the lungs, i.e., inspiration (Figure 17.2a). Relaxation of the diaphragm and the inter-costal muscles returns the diaphragm and sternum to their normal positions and reduce the thoracic volume and thereby the pulmonary volume. This leads to an increase in intra-pulmonary pressure to slightly above the atmospheric pressure causing the expulsion of air from the lungs, i.e., expiration (Figure 17.2b). We have the ability to increase the strength of inspiration and expiration with the help of additional muscles in the abdomen. On an average, a healthy human breathes 12-16 times/minute. The volume of air involved in breathing movements can be estimated by using a spirometer which helps in clinical assessment of pulmonary functions.
 17.2.1 Respiratory Volumes and Capacities Tidal Volume (TV): Volume of air inspired or expired during a normal respiration. It is approx. 500 mL., i.e., a healthy man can inspire or expire approximately 6000 to 8000 mL of air per minute. Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV): Additional volume of air, a person can inspire by a forcible inspiration. This averages 2500 mL to 3000 mL.

Vital Capacity (VC): The maximum volume of air a person can breathe in after a forced expiration. This includes ERV, TV and IRV or the maximum volume of air a person can breathe out after a forced inspiration. Total Lung Capacity (TLC): Total volume of air accommodated in the lungs at the end of a forced inspiration. This includes RV, ERV, TV and IRV or vital capacity + residual volume.

"Explain why the following things happen: (i) The more oxygen is released from oxyhaemoglobin in a more active tissue than in a less active one. (ii) Oxygenation of blood promotes the release of carbon dioxide from the blood in the lungs. (iii) Oxygen leaves the blood from tissue capillaries, out carbon dioxide enters the blood in tissue capillaries. (iv) Erythrocytes can carry out anaerobic metabolism only. (v) Gaseous exchanges continue in the lungs. without interruption even during expiration.","(i) The more oxygen is released from oxyhaemoglobin in a more active tissue because its partial oxygen pressure is lower than the least active tissue. The lower pO 2 in the active tissue causes the dissociation of oxyhaemoglobin to release sufficient oxygen required by the tissues. (ii) The CO 2 from the tissue is carried in the blood in three different forms; bicarbonate in plasma and erythrocytes, carbamino-haemoglobin in erythrocytes and small amounts of dissolved carbon dioxide in plasma. On reaching the lungs blood is oxygenated. It donates H+ which joins bicarbonate (HCOs) to form carbonic acid. This carbonic acid cleaves into H2Oand CO2 by carbonic anhydrase. In this way the CO 2 is released from the carbaminohaemoglobin. The oxygen affinity of haemoglobin also gets enhanced with the fall in the blood pCO 2 resulting from the elimination of CO 2 from the blood in the lungs. (iii) The blood in the tissue capillaries contains higher pO2 than the tissue fluid. So, oxygen is released from oxyhaemoglobin and diffuse from the capillary blood to the tissue fluid and finally to the cells to the tissue fluid to raise its pCO 2 than the capillary blood. This enables carbon dioxide to diffuse from the tissue fluid to the capillary blood. (iv) Erythrocytes lack mitochondria and respiratory enzymes to perform the process of aerobic respiration. Therefore, they undergo anaerobic respiration to carry out anaerobic metabolism only. (v) Gaseous exchange continues in the lungs continuously because some air remains inside the lungs even after deepest exhalation. This air is called as residual volume which never get drived out and this is sufficient to proceed gaseous exchange without any interruption. ","SUMMARY Cells utilise oxygen for metabolism and produce energy along with substances like carbon dioxide which is harmful. Animals have evolved different mechanisms for the transport of oxygen to the cells and for the removal of carbon dioxide from there. We have a well developed respiratory system comprising two lungs and associated air passages to perform this function. The first step in respiration is breathing by which atmospheric air is taken in (inspiration) and the alveolar air is released out (expiration). Exchange of O2 and CO2 between deoxygenated blood and alveoli, transport of these gases throughout the body by blood, exchange of O2 and CO2 between the oxygenated blood and tissues and utilisation of O2 by the cells (cellular respiration) are the other steps involved. Inspiration and expiration are carried out by creating pressure gradients between the atmosphere and the alveoli with the help of specialised muscles ‚Äì intercostals and diaphragm. Volumes of air involved in these activities can be estimated with the help of spirometer and are of clinical significance. Exchange of O2 and CO2 at the alveoli and tissues occur by diffusion. Rate of diffusion is dependent on the partial pressure gradients of O2 (pO2) and CO2 (pCO2), their solubility as well as the thickness of the diffusion surface. These factors in our body facilitate diffusion of O2 from the alveoli to the deoxygenated blood as well as from the oxygenated blood to the tissues. The factors are favourable for the diffusion of CO2 in the opposite direction, i.e., from tissues to alveoli. Oxygen is transported mainly as oxyhaemoglobin. In the alveoli where pO2 is higher, O2 gets bound to haemoglobin which is easily dissociated at the tissues where pO2 is low and pCO2 and H+ concentration are high. Nearly 70 per cent of carbon dioxide is transported as bicarbonate (HCO3‚Äì ) with the help of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. 20-25 per cent of carbon dioxide is carried by haemoglobin as carbamino-haemoglobin. In the tissues where pCO2 is high, it gets bound to blood whereas in the alveoli where pCO2 is low and pO2 is high, it gets removed from the blood. Respiratory rhythm is maintained by the respiratory centre in the medulla region of brain. A pneumotaxic centre in the pons region of the brain and a chemosensitive area in the medulla can alter respiratory mechanism.
 "
What is a respiratory centre ? What is its use in the process of respiration ?,"Respiration is controlled by a respiratory centre located in the floor of the medulla oblongata of the brain. The centre is bilateral and its two halves are connected together by commissural neurons. The sides of this centre are connected with motor respiratory neurons. The nerve cells of the centre are connected with the breathing apparatus forming a reflex arc. These nerve cells are sensitive to chemical composition of blood. Half of the respiratory centre is an inspiratory centre and the other half is an expiratory centre. These two centres control the entire breathing in man with his knowledge about it. Dorsal respiratory group, ventral respiratory group and pneumotaxic groups act as respiratory centres in the brain.  ","Human beings have a significant ability to maintain and moderate the respiratory rhythm to suit the demands of the body tissues. This is done by the neural system. A specialised centre present in the medulla region of the brain called respiratory rhythm centre is primarily responsible for this regulation. Another centre present in the pons region of the brain called pneumotaxic centre can moderate the functions of the respiratory rhythm centre. Neural signal from this centre can reduce the duration of inspiration and thereby alter the respiratory rate. A chemosensitive area is situated adjacent to the rhythm centre which is highly sensitive to CO2 and hydrogen ions. Increase in these substances can activate this centre, which in turn can signal the rhythm centre to make necessary adjustments in the respiratory process by which these substances can be eliminated. Receptors associated with aortic arch and carotid artery also can recognise changes in CO2 and H+ concentration and send necessary signals to the rhythm centre for remedial actions. The role of oxygen in the regulation of respiratory rhythm is quite insignificant.

Explain the histology of human gut.,The alimentary canal consists of four basic layers. From the outer surface inward to the lumen (cavity) the layers are as follows: (i) Serosa: (a) It is the outer most layer made up of a thin mesothelium with some connective tissues. (ii) Muscularis: (a) It is composed of outer longitudinal and inner circular muscle fibres. (b) In the stomach an additional layer of oblique muscle fibres is found inner to the circular muscle fibres. (iii) Submucosa: It consists of loose connective tissue richly supplied with blood and lymphatic vessels and in some areas with glands. (iv) Mucosa: It is named so because it secretes mucus to lubricate the inner lining of the gut. ,"like structure called stomach. A muscular sphincter (gastro-oesophageal) regulates the opening of oesophagus into the stomach. The stomach, located in the upper left portion of the abdominal cavity, has four major parts ‚Äì a cardiac portion into which the oesophagus opens, a fundic region, body (main central region) and a pyloric portion which opens into the first part of small intestine (Figure 16.3). Small intestine is distinguishable into three regions, a ‚ÄòC‚Äô shaped duodenum, a long coiled middle portion jejunum and a highly coiled ileum. The opening of the stomach into the duodenum is guarded by the pyloric sphincter. Ileum opens into the large intestine. It consists of caecum, colon and rectum. Caecum is a small blind sac which hosts some symbiotic micro-organisms. A narrow finger-like tubular projection, the vermiform appendix which is a vestigial organ, arises from the caecum. The caecum opens into the colon. The colon is divided into four parts ‚Äì an ascending, a transverse, descending part and a sigmoid colon. The descending part opens into the rectum which opens out through the anus. The wall of alimentary canal from oesophagus to rectum possesses four layers (Figure 16.4) namely serosa, muscularis, sub-mucosa and mucosa. Serosa is the outermost layer and is made up of a thin mesothelium (epithelium of visceral organs) with some connective tissues. Muscularis is formed by smooth muscles usually arranged into an inner circular and an outer longitudinal layer. An oblique muscle layer may be present in some regions. The submucosal layer is formed of loose connective tissues containing nerves, blood and lymph vessels. In duodenum, glands are also present in sub-mucosa. The innermost layer lining the lumen of the alimentary canal is the mucosa. This layer forms irregular folds (rugae) in the stomach and small finger-like foldings called villi in the small intestine (Figure 16.5). The cells lining the villi produce numerous microscopic

 up of a single layer of columnar epithelial cells which contain secretory gland cells. The alimentary canal is a straight tube and runs between first to last segment of the body. (Figure 7.10). A terminal mouth opens into the buccal cavity (1-3 segments) which leads into muscular pharynx. A small narrow tube, oesophagus (5-7 segments), continues into a muscular gizzard (8-9 segments). It helps in grinding the soil particles and decaying leaves, etc. The stomach extends from 9-14 segments. The food of the earthworm is decaying leaves and organic matter mixed with soil. Calciferous glands, present in the stomach, neutralise the humic acid present in humus. Intestine starts from the 15th segment onwards and continues till the last segment. A pair of short and conical intestinal caecae project from the intestine on the 26th segment. The characteristic feature of the intestine after 26th segment except the last 23rd-25th segments is the presence of internal median fold of dorsal wall called typhlosole. This increases the effective area of absorption in the intestine. The alimentary canal opens to the exterior by a small rounded aperture called anus. The ingested organic rich soil passes through the digestive tract where digestive enzymes breakdown complex food into smaller absorbable units. These simpler molecules are absorbed through intestinal membranes and are utilised. Pheretima exhibits a closed type of blood vascular system, consisting of blood vessels, capillaries and heart. (Figure 7.11). Due to closed circulatory system, blood is confined to the heart and blood vessels. Contractions keep blood circulating in one direction. Smaller blood vessels supply the gut, nerve cord, and the body wall. Blood glands are present on the 4th, 5th and 6th segments. They produce blood cells and haemoglobin which is dissolved in blood plasma. Blood cells are phagocytic in nature. Earthworms lack specialised breathing devices. Respiratory exchange occurs through moist body surface into their blood stream.
 "
Explain the types and functions of glands associated with alimentary canal.,"Glands associated with alimentary canal are: (1) Salivary glands: A salivary gland may be defined as any cell or organ which discharges a secretion into the oral cavity. Human salivary glands are classified into two categories: major salivary glands and minor salivary glands. (a) Major Salivary glands: In man the major salivary glands are three pairs: parotid, sublingual and submandibular glands. (i) Parotid glands: These are the largest salivary glands which are situated near the ears. Their ducts open into the oral cavity near the upper second molars. The duct of parotid gland is called Stenson‚Äôs duct.  (ii) Sublingual glands: These are small-sized salivary glands which are located beneath the tongue and their ducts are called sublingual ducts or ducts of Rivinus. (iii) Submandibular glands: These are medium sized salivary glands which are located at the angles of the lower jaw. Their ducts open into the oral cavity near the lower central incisors. The duct of submandibular gland is called Wharton's duct. The parotid salivary glands secrete much of salivary amylase. (b) Minor salivary glands: There are numerous small glands situated in the mucous membrane of the lips (libial glands), Cheeks (buccal glands), tongue lingual glands) and palate (palatine glands). The secretions of these glands help to keep the mouth moist and provide a protective and lubricant coat of mucus. The fluids secreted by major and minor salivary glands constitute saliva. (2) Gastric glands: These are numerous microscopic, tubular glands formed by the epithelium of the stomach. The following types of cells are present in the epithelium of the gastric glands. (i) Peptic cells: (= chief or Zymogenic or Zymogen cells). They are usually basal in location and secrete gastric digestive enzymes as proenzymes or zymogens; pepsinogen and prorennin. (ii) Oxyntic cells: They are large and are most numerous on the side walls of the gastric glands They secrete hydrochloric acid and Castle‚Äôs intrinsic factor. (iii) Mucous cells: They are present between other types of cells and secrete mucus. (3) Liver: It is the largest gland of the body which secrete heparin (anticoagulant). It also produces bile. (4) Pancreas: It is a soft lobulated pinkish gland which secretes two major hormones: (i) Insulin, (ii) Glucagon. (5) Intestinal gland: These are formed by the surface epithelium of small intestine. These are of two types: (i) Crypts of Lieberkuhn which secrete mucus and digestive enzymes. (ii) Brunner's gland found in duodenum which secretes mucus.","projections called microvilli giving a brush border appearance. These modifications increase the surface area enormously. Villi are supplied with a network of capillaries and a large lymph vessel called the lacteal. Mucosal epithelium has goblet cells which secrete mucus that help in lubrication. Mucosa also forms glands in the stomach (gastric glands) and crypts in between the bases of villi in the intestine (crypts of Lieberkuhn). All the four layers show modifications in different parts of the alimentary canal.
 16.1.2
 The digestive glands associated with the alimentary canal include the salivary glands, the liver and the pancreas. A section of small intestinal Saliva is mainly produced by three pairs of mucosa showing villi salivary glands, the parotids (cheek), the submaxillary/sub-mandibular (lower jaw) and the sub- linguals (below the tongue). These glands situated just outside the buccal cavity secrete salivary juice into the buccal cavity. Liver is the largest gland of the body weighing about 1.2 to 1.5 kg in an adult human. It is situated in the abdominal cavity, just below the diaphragm and has two lobes. The hepatic lobules are the structural and functional units of liver containing hepatic cells arranged in the form of cords. Each lobule is covered by a thin connective tissue sheath called the Glisson‚Äôs capsule. The bile secreted by the hepatic cells passes through the hepatic ducts and is stored and concentrated in a thin muscular sac called the gall bladder.

"Differentiate between duodenum, jejunum and ileum.","(i) Coagulation of milk in the alimentary canal: (a) When the food or milk reaches stomach, the protein digestion starts. (b) Pepsin stimulates the digestion of proteins in milk (casein). HCl activates pepsinogen into pepsin. (c) It hydrolyses soluble casein into paracasein which gets precipitated as calcium paracaseinate to make solid curd i.e., coagulation of milk. (d) There is a milk-coagulating enzyme called rennin which is found in calf gastric juice.  (e) Rennin is secreted as pro-rennin (inactive state) but in presence of HCl it is hydrolysed into active rennin. (f) Rennin hydrolyses casein into paracasein leading to milk coagulation. (ii) Digestion of starch in the alimentary canal: (a) In man and most of the other mammals, digestion starts in mouth or buccal cavity. (b) There are three pairs of salivary glands present in the mouth. These glands secrete a alkaline fluid called saliva. (c) The crushed food is mixed with saliva and is converted into a pulpy mass called bolus. (d) Saliva contains enzyme ptyalin (salivary amylase) which acts on cooked starches (polysaccharides) changing them to the disaccharide maltose. (e) Optimum pH for this reaction is 6.8. As soon as the food reaches the stomach, the ptyalin stops because of the acidic, reaction of gastric juice, pH 1.5 to 1.8. The stomach contents entering the duodenum are now called as chyme. (f) When acid chyme passes into the small intestine it is mixed first with the pancreatic juice and bile and then with the intestinal juice. (g) Pancreatic juice contains enzyme amylase which converts all digestible polysaccharides (starches) not affected by ptyalin to disaccharides (sugars). (h) Intestinal juice also contains amylase, sucrase, maltase and lactase. (i) These enzymes convert disaccharide into monosaccharides and hence digestion starch is completed.","SUMMARY The digestive system of humans consists of an alimentary canal and associated digestive glands. The alimentary canal consists of the mouth, buccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and the anus. The accessory digestive glands include the salivary glands, the liver (with gall bladder) and the pancreas. Inside the mouth the teeth masticates the food, the tongue tastes the food and manipulates it for proper mastication by mixing with the saliva. Saliva contains a starch digestive enzyme, salivary amylase that digests the starch and converts it into maltose (disaccharide). The food then passes into the pharynx and enters the oesophagus in the form of bolus, which is further carried down through the oesophagus by peristalsis into the stomach. In stomach mainly protein digestion takes place. Absorption of simple sugars, alcohol and medicines also takes place in the stomach. The chyme (food) enters into the duodenum portion of the small intestine and is acted on by the pancreatic juice, bile and finally by the enzymes in the succus entericus, so that the digestion of carbohydrates, proteins and fats is completed. The food then enters into the jejunum and ileum portions of the small intestine. Carbohydrates are digested and converted into monosaccharides like glucose. Proteins are finally broken down into amino acids. The fats are converted to fatty acids and glycerol.
 "
Mention the pathways for absorption.,"There are two pathways for absorption i.e., (i) Water, mineral salts, water soluble vitamins, monosaccharides and amino acids are carried to the liver by the hepatic portal system. From the liver, these materials finally enter the blood stream. (ii) Fatty acids, glycerol, steroids and fats soluble vitamins are absorbed by lymphatic system and then carried into the blood stream. Chyle  (iii) Amino acids and simple sugars  ‚Üí ","16.3 ABSORPTION OF DIGESTED PRODUCTS Absorption is the process by which the end products of digestion pass through the intestinal mucosa into the blood or lymph. It is carried out by passive, active or facilitated transport mechanisms. Small amounts of monosaccharides like glucose, amino acids and some electrolytes like chloride ions are generally absorbed by simple diffusion. The passage of these substances into the blood depends upon the concentration gradients. However, some substances like glucose and amino acids are absorbed with the help of carrier proteins. This mechanism is called the facilitated transport. Transport of water depends upon the osmotic gradient. Active transport occurs against the concentration gradient and hence requires energy. Various nutrients like amino acids, monosaccharides like glucose, electrolytes like Na+ are absorbed into the blood by this mechanism. Fatty acids and glycerol being insoluble, cannot be absorbed into the

Q. 10.. Write about some disorders of digestive system.,"Digestion is a process in which complex food materials are broken down by enzymes into simpler substances, which can be easily assimilated by the body. The pancreatic duct and bile duct open into the duodenum of the Here the food gets mixed by bile juice and pancreatic juice. Bile juice does not contain any enzyme. However, it plays an important part in digestion as it provides an alkaline medium to food and helps in emulsification of fat. The pancreatic juice contains the following enzymes, which act upon different kinds of food stuffs. (i) Trypsin, which acts on proteins and changes them to peptones. (ii) Pancreatic amylase, which acts on carbohydrates and changes them to maltose or to other complex sugars. (iii) Lipase, which acts on fats and changes them to soluble fatty acids and glycerol. The intestinal glands secrete enzymes like, (a) Erepsin, which helps to convert peptides into amino acids. (b) Maltase, which changes maltose to glucose. (c) Lactase, which changes lactose into glucose and galactose. (d) Sucrase, which changes sucrose into glucose and fructose. In this way, the digestion of food is completed in the small intestine.  ","SUMMARY The digestive system of humans consists of an alimentary canal and associated digestive glands. The alimentary canal consists of the mouth, buccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and the anus. The accessory digestive glands include the salivary glands, the liver (with gall bladder) and the pancreas. Inside the mouth the teeth masticates the food, the tongue tastes the food and manipulates it for proper mastication by mixing with the saliva. Saliva contains a starch digestive enzyme, salivary amylase that digests the starch and converts it into maltose (disaccharide). The food then passes into the pharynx and enters the oesophagus in the form of bolus, which is further carried down through the oesophagus by peristalsis into the stomach. In stomach mainly protein digestion takes place. Absorption of simple sugars, alcohol and medicines also takes place in the stomach. The chyme (food) enters into the duodenum portion of the small intestine and is acted on by the pancreatic juice, bile and finally by the enzymes in the succus entericus, so that the digestion of carbohydrates, proteins and fats is completed. The food then enters into the jejunum and ileum portions of the small intestine. Carbohydrates are digested and converted into monosaccharides like glucose. Proteins are finally broken down into amino acids. The fats are converted to fatty acids and glycerol.

"(i) Give the general structure of amino acid. (ii) Classify amino acids on the basis of number of amino group and carboxylic group. Give example for each type. (iii) Illustrate the structure of glycine, alanine and serine.   ","Ans.(i) They are the organic acids (with carboxylic group -COOH) having amino group (-NH2 ) generally attached to ùëé-carbon next to the carboxylic group. The ùëé-carbon also bears a variable hydrocarbon or alkyl group R and hydrogen. Amino acids are, therefore, substituted methanes where the four substituted groups occupy the four valency positions. R is represented by H in glycine, methyl group in alanine (ii) Depending upon the number of amino group and carboxylic groups, amino acids have been classified as: (a) Neutral amino acids: The neutral amino acids have one amino group and one carboxylic group e.g. alanine, glycine. (b) Acidic amino acids: The acidic amino acids have an extra carboxylic group e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid. (c) Basic amino acids : The basic amino acids have an additional amino group e.g. lysine, arginine (d) Structure of glycine, alanine and serine: Glycine: ","types. The R group in these proteinaceous amino acids could be a hydrogen (the amino acid is called glycine), a methyl group (alanine), hydroxy methyl (serine), etc. Three of the twenty are shown in Figure 9.1. The chemical and physical properties of amino acids are essentially of the amino, carboxyl and the R functional groups. Based on number of amino and carboxyl groups, there are acidic (e.g., glutamic acid), basic (lysine) and neutral (valine) amino acids. Similarly, there are aromatic amino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan). A particular property of amino acids is the ionizable nature of ‚ÄìNH2 and ‚ÄìCOOH groups. Hence in solutions of different pH, the structure of amino acids changes.
 B is called zwitterionic form. Lipids are generally water insoluble. They could be simple fatty acids. A fatty acid has a carboxyl group attached to an R group. The R group could be a methyl (‚ÄìCH3), or ethyl (‚ÄìC2H5) or higher number of ‚ÄìCH2 groups (1 carbon to 19 carbons). For example, palmitic acid has 16 carbons including carboxyl carbon. Arachidonic acid has 20 carbon atoms including the carboxyl carbon. Fatty acids could be saturated (without double bond) or unsaturated (with one or more C=C double bonds). Another simple lipid is glycerol which is trihydroxy propane. Many lipids have both glycerol and fatty acids. Here the fatty acids are found esterified with glycerol. They can be then monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides. These are also called fats and oils based on melting point. Oils have lower melting point (e.g., gingelly oil) and hence remain as oil in winters. Can you identify a fat from the market? Some lipids have phosphorous and a phosphorylated organic compound in them. These are phospholipids. They are found in cell membrane. Lecithin is one example. Some tissues especially the neural tissues have lipids with more complex structures. Living organisms have a number of carbon compounds in which heterocyclic rings can be found. Some of these are nitrogen bases ‚Äì adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, and thymine. When found attached to a sugar, they are called nucleosides. If a phosphate group is also found esterified to the sugar they are called nucleotides. Adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and cytidine are nucleosides. Adenylic acid, thymidylic acid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid and cytidylic acid are nucleotides. Nucleic acids like DNA and RNA consist of nucleotides only. DNA and RNA function as genetic material.

Describe the structure of DNA as proposed by Watson and Crick.,"Based on X-ray diffraction, Watson and Crick in1953, proposed double helical model of DNA. The model proposed that: (i) Each DNA molecule consists of two helical polynucleotide chains or strands. (ii) The strands run anti-parallel i.e., their 3‚Äô-5‚Äô phosphodiester bonds are in opposite direction and the 3‚Äô end of one strand lies besides the 5‚Äô end of the other. (iii) In each polynucleotide chain, the phosphate molecules lie on the outer side of deoxyribose and the nitrogenous bases inward, perpendicular to the helical axis.  (iv) The nitrogenous bases of two strands are linked through hydrogen bonds. Base paring is specific. (Adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine) (v) There are two hydrogen bonds between A = T and three between G = C. ùëú (vi) Length of H - bond is 3 . Two strands are therefore complementary. ùëú (vii) One turn of helix is about 34 and contains 10 nucleotides. ùëú (viii) The distance between the adjacent nucleotide is34 . ùëú (ix) The diameter of helix is about 20 . (x) In a DNA molecule, the two complementary chains are twisted to form double helix around a common central axis. ","There are two hydrogen bonds between A and T and three hydrogen bonds between G and C. Each strand appears like a helical staircase. Each step of ascent is represented by a pair of bases. At each step of ascent, the strand turns 36¬∞. One full turn of the helical strand would involve ten steps or ten base pairs. Attempt drawing a line diagram. The pitch would be 34√Ö. The rise per base pair would be 3.4√Ö. This form of DNA with the above mentioned salient features is called BDNA. In higher classes, you will be told that there are more than a dozen forms of DNA named after English alphabets with unique structural features.

What are the functions of polysaccharides?,"The functions of polysaccharides are: (i) Starch and glycogen are the major storage food of organic world. (ii) On hydrolysis, carbohydrates provide both energy and carbon chains. (iii) Chitin is the structural carbohydrate of fungal walls and exoskeleton of arthropods. (iv) Cellulose is the structural substance of cell walls in most of the plants. (v) Cellulose is economically important in the production of furniture, shelter, fuel, paper, textiles, ropes, rayon, cellophane, plastics etc. (vi) Mucilage present as a protective coating around aquatic plants, bacteria, blue-green algae etc., is derived from polysaccharides.  (vii) Mucopolysaccharides present inside human body are keratin sulphate, chondroitin sulphate and hyaluronic acid. They have several functions - lubrication of ligaments and tendons, providing strength and flexibility to skin etc. (viii) Some mucopolysaccharides have medicinal and other commercial importance e.g., husk of Plantago ovata, mucilage of Aloe, and alginic acid. (ix) Pectins are commercial jelly agents.","Plant cell walls are made of cellulose. Paper made from plant pulp and cotton fibre is cellulosic. There are more complex polysaccharides in nature. They have as building blocks, amino-sugars and chemically modified sugars (e.g., glucosamine, N-acetyl galactosamine, etc.). Exoskeletons of arthropods, for example, have a complex polysaccharide called chitin. These complex polysaccharides are mostly homopolymers.

Briefly describe various kinds of lipids.,"Following are the different types of lipids: (i) Simple lipids: These are esters of fatty acid with glycerol. They are of two types. (a) Neutral or true fats : These are esters of fatty acid with glycerol. They are also called glycerol. A fat molecule consists of one molecule of glycerol and one to three molecules of the same or different long-chain fatty acids.  ÔÇ∑ ÔÇ∑  Glycerol has 3 carbons, each bearing a hydroxyl (-OH) group. A fatty acid molecule is an unbranched chain of carbon atoms having a carboxylic group attached to an R group. The R group could be a methyl (-CH3) or ethyl (-C2H5 ) or higher number of -CH2 groups (C to 19-C). e.g. Palmitic acid has 16-C. Fatty acids are of two types:  ÔÇ∑ ÔÇ∑  Saturated fatty acids : These are fatty acids without double bond., e.g. Palmitic acid. Unsaturated fatty acids : These are fatty acids with one or more double bonds., e.g., oleic acids.  Neutral fats may be monoglycerides if there is only one molecule of fatty acid attached to a glycerol molecule. If the number of fatty acids attached is two then it is a diglyceride or triglyceride if it is three. (b) Waxes : These are esters of fatty acids with alcohol of high molecular weight instead of glycerol, e.g., bee wax, lanolin etc. (ii) Compound lipids : These are esters of fatty acids with alcohol, but contain same other substances also. e.g., phospholipids, glycolipids. (iii) Derived lipids such as steroids, prostaglandins etc.","B is called zwitterionic form. Lipids are generally water insoluble. They could be simple fatty acids.

Explain briefly the structural levels of proteins. Describe primary and secondary structures of proteins.    ,"Proteins are macromolecules having one or more polypeptide chains of amino acids. These are highly organised linear polymers of amino acids. Proteins have four structural levels - primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary.  (i) Primary structure : The linear sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is the primary structure of protein. The first amino acid is called N-terminus and last amino acid is called C-terminus. (ii) Secondary structure : The polypeptide chains are coiled or folded in the form of helix. The structure is maintained by a series of regularly spaced intra or inter molecular hydrogen bonds formed between the amino acids of the same or different polypeptide chains. Such a conformation is termed as secondary structure. There are 3 types of secondary structure, Œ±helix, Œ≤-pleated and collagen helix. (iii) Tertiary structure : The helical polypeptide molecules further coiled to assume a complex but specific form is called tertiary structure. They are so arranged as to hide nonpolar amino acid inside and expose the polar side chains. These structure are maintained by several types of bonds such as hydrogen bonds, vander Waal interaction, ionic bonds, disulphide bonds etc., between the polypeptide chains. (iv) Quaternary structure: Each polypeptide develops its own tertiary structure and functions as subunit of the protein. The different charged subunits pack together to give specific conformation. Large proteins such as haemoglobin have quaternary structure. It has four chains, two ùëé-chains and two ùõΩ-chains.","9.7 STRUCTURE OF PROTEINS Proteins, as mentioned earlier, are heteropolymers containing strings of amino acids. Structure of molecules means different things in different contexts. In inorganic chemistry, the structure invariably refers to the molecular formulae (e.g., NaCl, MgCl2, etc.). Organic chemists always write a two dimensional view of the molecules while representing the structure of the molecules (e.g., benzene, naphthalene, etc.). Physicists conjure up the three dimensional views of molecular structures while biologists describe the protein structure at four levels. The sequence of amino acids i.e., the positional information in a protein ‚Äì which is the first amino acid, which is second, and so on ‚Äì is called the primary structure (Figure 9.3a) of a protein. A protein is imagined as a line, the left end represented by the first amino acid and the right end represented by the last amino

 acid. The first amino acid is also called as N-terminal amino acid. The last amino acid is called the Cterminal amino acid. A protein thread does not exist throughout as an extended rigid rod. The thread is folded in the form of a helix (similar to a revolving staircase). Of course, only some portions of the protein thread are arranged in the form of a helix. In proteins, only right handed helices are observed. Other regions of the protein thread are folded into other forms in what is called the secondary structure (Fig. 9.4 b). In addition, the long protein chain is also folded upon itself like a hollow woolen ball, giving rise to the tertiary structure (Figure 9.4 c). This gives us a 3-dimensional view of a protein. Tertiary structure is absolutely necessary for the many biological activities of proteins. Some proteins are an assembly of more than one polypeptide or subunits. The manner in which these individual folded polypeptides or subunits are arranged with respect to each other (e.g. linear string of spheres, spheres arranged one upon each other in the form of a cube or plate etc.) is the architecture of a protein otherwise called the quaternary structure of a protein (Fig. 9.4 d). Adult human haemoglobin consists of 4 subunits. Two of these are identical to each other. Hence, two subunits of Œ± type and two subunits of Œ≤ type together constitute the human haemoglobin (Hb).

(vi) (vii) (viii)  Can replicate and makes its copy. Controls structure, metabolism, differentiation and inheritance.  (ix)  Very long molecule; with very high molecular weight.

They are single-stranded polynucleotide chains; strand in RNA is coiled on itself and may be united by hydrogen (H) bonds. The sugar is ribose. Four nitrogenous bases in it are : (i) Adenine, (ii) Guanine, (iii) Cytosine, (iv) Uracil. i.e., in RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil. Not occur in equal proportion/ratio. It is not the hereditary material except in few viruses. Cannot replicate; it is made from DNA. Helps in protein synthesis; function as a messenger and translates messages coded in DNA into protein. Relatively short molecule with low molecular weight. Genetic material only in some viruses. ","9.6 NUCLEIC ACIDS The other type of macromolecule that one would find in the acid insoluble fraction of any living tissue is the nucleic acid. These are polynucleotides. Together with polysaccharides and polypeptides these comprise the true macromolecular fraction of any living tissue or cell. For nucleic acids, the building block is a nucleotide. A nucleotide has three chemically distinct components. One is a heterocyclic compound, the second is a monosaccharide and the third a phosphoric acid or phosphate. As you notice in Figure 9.1, the heterocyclic compounds in nucleic acids are the nitrogenous bases named adenine, guanine, uracil, cytosine, and thymine. Adenine and Guanine are substituted purines while the rest are substituted pyrimidines. The skeletal heterocyclic ring is called as purine and pyrimidine respectively. The sugar found in polynucleotides is either ribose (a monosaccharide pentose) or 2‚Äô deoxyribose. A nucleic acid containing deoxyribose is called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) while that which contains ribose is called ribonucleic acid (RNA).

(iv) e.g., Nutrition, growth etc.  Catabolism It is the destructive phase of the metabolism. Converge reactions. It releases energy. e.g., Respiration. ","9.12.6 Co-factors Enzymes are composed of one or several polypeptide chains. However, there are a number of cases in which non-protein constituents called cofactors are bound to the the enzyme to make the enzyme catalytically active. In these instances, the protein portion of the enzymes is called the apoenzyme. Three kinds of cofactors may be identified: prosthetic groups, co-enzymes and metal ions. Prosthetic groups are organic compounds and are distinguished from other cofactors in that they are tightly bound to the apoenzyme. For example, in peroxidase and catalase, which catalyze the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, haem is the prosthetic group and it is a part of the active site of the enzyme. Co-enzymes are also organic compounds but their association with the apoenzyme is only transient, usually occurring during the course of catalysis. Furthermore, co-enzymes serve as co-factors in a number of different enzyme catalyzed reactions. The essential chemical components of many coenzymes are vitamins, e.g., coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and NADP contain the vitamin niacin. A number of enzymes require metal ions for their activity which form coordination bonds with side chains at the active site and at the same time form one or more cordination bonds with the substrate, e.g., zinc is a cofactor for the proteolytic enzyme carboxypeptidase. Catalytic activity is lost when the co-factor is removed from the enzyme which testifies that they play a crucial role in the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

Illustrate lock and key hypothesis of enzyme action.   ,"Mechanism of Enzyme Action: (i) The working of enzymes is a complex one. (ii) All enzymes first of all combine with the respective substrates before yielding the products of the reactions they catalyze. (iii) In other words, enzymes with substrates form an intermediate complex before decomposition of the substrate can occur. (iv) In order to explain the mode of action of enzyme Fischer proposed a Lock and Key theory According to him, if the right key fits in the right lock, the lock can be opened, otherwise not. (v) It is believed that molecules have specific geometric shapes. Proteins are able to act as enzyme primarily because their shape provides surface configurations into which other molecules can fit.  (vi) The molecules which are acted upon by the enzymes are called substrates of the enzymes.  (vii) Under the above assumption only those substrate molecules with the proper geometric shape can fit into the active site of the enzymes. (viii) However, under special circumstances some other molecules which are similar to the substrate can also combine with the active site of an enzyme. (ix) If this happens, the above molecules may compete with the substrate and the reaction may either slow down or stop. (x) Such substances are called as the competitive inhibitors as they act to prevent the production of a substance.  ","9.12.3 Nature of Enzyme Action Each enzyme (E) has a substrate (S) binding site in its molecule so that a highly reactive enzyme-substrate complex (ES) is produced. This complex is short-lived and dissociates into its product(s) P and the unchanged enzyme with an intermediate formation of the enzyme-product complex (EP). The formation of the ES complex is essential for catalysis.
 The catalytic cycle of an enzyme action can be described in the following steps: 1. First, the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, fitting into the active site. 2. The binding of the substrate induces the enzyme to alter its shape, fitting more tightly around the substrate. 3. The active site of the enzyme, now in close proximity of the substrate breaks the chemical bonds of the substrate and the new enzyme- product complex is formed. 4. The enzyme releases the products of the reaction and the free enzyme is ready to bind to another molecule of the substrate and run through the catalytic cycle once again.
 9.12.4 Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity The activity of an enzyme can be affected by a change in the conditions which can alter the tertiary structure of the protein. These include temperature, pH, change in substrate concentration or binding of specific chemicals that regulate its activity. Temperature and pH Enzymes generally function in a narrow range of temperature and pH (Figure 9.7). Each enzyme shows its highest activity at a particular temperature and pH called the optimum temperature and optimum pH. Activity declines both below and above the optimum value. Low temperature preserves the enzyme in a temporarily inactive state whereas high temperature destroys enzymatic activity because proteins are denatured by heat.

A motor neuron alongwith the muscle fibres connected to it constitute a motor unit. The junction between a motor neuron and the sarcolemma of the muscle fibre is called the neuromuscular junction or motor-end plate. A neural signal reaching this junction releases a neurotransmitter (Acetyl choline) which generates an action potential in the sarcolemma. This spreads through the muscle fibre and causes the release of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. Increase in Ca++ level leads to the binding of calcium with a subunit of troponin on actin filaments and thereby remove the masking of active sites for myosin.

Our vertebral column (Figure 20.7) is formed by 26 serially arranged units called vertebrae and is dorsally placed. It extends from the base of the skull and constitutes the main framework of the trunk. Each vertebra has a central hollow portion (neural canal) through which the spinal cord passes. First vertebra is the atlas and it articulates with the occipital condyles. The vertebral column is differentiated into cervical (7), thoracic (12), lumbar (5), sacral (1-fused) and coccygeal (1-fused) regions starting from the skull. The number of cervical vertebrae are seven in almost all mammals including human beings. The vertebral column protects the spinal cord, supports the head and serves as the point of attachment for the ribs and musculature of the back. Sternum is a flat bone on the ventral midline of thorax. There are 12 pairs of ribs. Each rib is a thin flat bone connected dorsally to the vertebral column and ventrally to the sternum. It has two articulation surfaces on its dorsal end and is hence called bicephalic. First seven pairs of ribs are called true ribs. Dorsally, they are attached to the thoracic vertebrae and ventrally connected to the sternum with the help of hyaline cartilage. The 8th, 9th and 10th pairs of ribs do not articulate directly with the sternum but join the seventh rib with the help of hyaline cartilage. These are called vertebrochondral (false) ribs. Last 2 pairs (11th and 12th) of ribs are not connected ventrally and are therefore, called floating ribs. Thoracic vertebrae, ribs and sternum together form the rib cage (Figure 20.8). The bones of the limbs alongwith their girdles constitute the appendicular skeleton. Each limb is made of 30 bones. The bones of the hand (fore limb) are humerus, radius and

A cup shaped bone called patella cover the knee ventrally (knee cap). Pectoral and Pelvic girdle bones help in the articulation of the upper and the lower limbs respectively with the axial skeleton. Each girdle is formed of two halves. Each half of pectoral girdle consists of a clavicle and a scapula (Figure 20.9). Scapula is a large triangular flat bone situated in the dorsal part of the thorax between the second and the seventh ribs. The dorsal, flat, triangular body of scapula has a slightly elevated ridge called the spine which projects as a flat, expanded process called the acromion. The clavicle articulates with this. Below the acromion is a depression called the glenoid cavity which articulates with the head of the humerus to form the shoulder joint. Each clavicle is a long slender bone with two curvatures. This bone is commonly called the collar bone. Pelvic girdle consists of two coxal bones (Figure 20.10). Each coxal bone is formed by the fusion of three bones ‚Äì ilium, ischium and pubis. At the point of fusion of the above bones is a cavity called acetabulum to which the thigh bone articulates. The two halves of the pelvic girdle meet ventrally to form the pubic symphysis containing fibrous cartilage.

Explain any two disorders of bones.,"Disorders of bones: Arthritis and osteoporosis are two diseases of bones in humans. (i) Arthritis Inflammation of the joints is the main cause of it. It is of many types like rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gouty arthritis. (a) The rheumatoid arthritis is diagnosed by the presence of rheumatoid factor. The joints becomes immovable. It is cured by heat treatment and physiotheraphy. (b) The osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disorder. It is characterized by the degeneration of the articular cartilage and proliferation of new bones. (c) The gouty arthritis is called gout. This is caused due to excessive formation of uric acid which gets deposited at the joints. (ii) Osteoporosis: (a) It is age-dependent systemic disorder. (b) It is characterized by low bone mass, microarchitectural deterioration of the bone. (c) It is also characterized to fracture. (d) It can occur in the pregnant women. (e) Thyrocalcitonin, parathyroid and sex-hormones imbalance is the main cause of this disease. (f) Major causative factors are the deficiency of vitamin D and calcium deficiency in the body.","Myasthenia gravis: Auto immune disorder affecting neuromuscular junction leading to fatigue, weakening and paralysis of skeletal muscle. Muscular dystrophy: Progressive degeneration of skeletal muscle mostly due to genetic disorder. Tetany: Rapid spasms (wild contractions) in muscle due to low Ca++ in body fluid. Arthritis: Inflammation of joints. Osteoporosis: Age-related disorder characterised by decreased bone mass and increased chances of fractures. Decreased levels of estrogen is a common cause. Gout: Inflammation of joints due to accumulation of uric acid crystals.

How Many types of synovial joints are there? Explain. ,"According to the shape and the movement, the synovial joints are of six types: (i) Gliding Joint: The articular surface of this joint are usually flat, permitting only back and forth and side to side movements. No rotation or twisting is possible because bones are tightly packed. e.g., joints between carpal and tarsal bones. (ii) Hinge joint: In this, the surface of one bone fits into the concave surface of another bone. e.g., joints in elbow, knee, ankle etc. (iii) Pivot joint: A pivot joint is a joint that allows movement in only one plane. In this rounded bone fits into a shallow depression of another bone. Ex. Joint between atlas and axis, radius and ulna. (v) Saddle joint: It allows the movement in two planes freely. The projection of one bone fits in saddle shaped depression of another bone. e.g., the joint between the carpal and metacarpal of thumb of hand. (vi) Ball and socket joint: This is the most freely movable joint. In this, a ball like structure on the one bone fits into socket like structure in another bone. e.g., shoulder and hip joints.  ","this. Joints are points of contact between bones, or between bones and cartilages. Force generated by the muscles is used to carry out movement through joints, where the joint acts as a fulcrum. The movability at these joints vary depending on different factors. Joints have been classified into three major structural forms, namely, fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial. Fibrous joints do not allow any movement. This type of joint is shown by the flat skull bones which fuse end-to-end with the help of dense fibrous connective tissues in the form of sutures, to form the cranium. In cartilaginous joints, the bones involved are joined together with the help of cartilages. The joint between the adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column is of this pattern and it permits limited movements. Synovial joints are characterised by the presence of a fluid filled synovial cavity between the articulating surfaces of the two bones. Such an arragement allows considerable movement. These joints help in locomotion and many other movements. Ball and socket joint (between humerus and pectoral girdle), hinge joint (knee joint), pivot joint (between atlas and axis), gliding joint (between the carpals) and saddle joint (between carpal and metacarpal of thumb) are some examples.

Demonstrate an experiment to show osmosis.,"The mouth of a thistle funnel is tied with a semipermeable membrane. The thistle funnel filled with sugar solution is then dipped in a beaker containing water. Water will move into the funnel resulting in rise in the level of the solution. This will continue till the equilibrium is reached. If pressure is applied to the solution from the upper part of the funnel, no water diffuses into the funnel through the membrane.

"What is the term used for long distance movement of carbohydrates in plants ? How and in what form do the carbohydrates synthesized in the leaves, reach long distance parts in a plant? ","The food material synthesized in the leaves is translocated to the different regions of the plants through the phloem either by cytoplasmic streaming hypothesis or by mass flow hypothesis. (i) According to mass flow hypothesis proposed by Munch (1926), the translocation of food takes place from leaves to the storage organs of the plant. (ii) The food in the form of glucose is prepared by leaves by the process of photosynthesis. (iii) It increases the osmotic potential. As a result, the water from the xylem cells enters into the leaf cells by increasing turgor pressure. (iv) At the other end or in fruits and seeds, there is a low concentration of sugar which results in a low turgor and osmotic pressure. This difference in the pressure occurs on the two extreme sides i.e., on one side there are leaves and on the other side there are other organs of the plant. ","as complex carbohydrates. The loss of solute produces a high water potential in the phloem, and water passes out, returning eventually to xylem. A simple experiment, called girdling, was used to identify the tissues through which food is transported. On the trunk of a tree a ring of bark up to a depth of the phloem layer, can be carefully removed. In the absence of downward movement of food the portion of the bark above the ring on the stem becomes swollen after a few weeks. This simple experiment shows that phloem is the tissue responsible for translocation of food; and that transport takes place in one direction, i.e., towards the roots. This experiment can be performed by you easily.
 SUMMARY Plants obtain a variety of inorganic elements (ions) and salts from their surroundings especially from water and soil. The movement of these nutrients from environment into the plant as well as from one plant cell to another plant cell essentially involves movement across a cell membrane. Transport across cell membrane can be through diffusion, facilitated transport or active transport. Water and minerals absorbed by roots are transported by xylem and the organic material synthesised in the leaves is transported to other parts of plant through phloem. Passive transport (diffusion, osmosis) and active transport are the two modes of nutrient transport across cell membranes in living organisms. In passive transport, nutrients move across the membrane by diffusion, without any use of energy as it is always down the concentration gradient and hence entropy driven. This diffusion of substances depends on their size, solubility in water or organic solvents. Osmosis is the special type of diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane which depends on pressure gradient and concentration gradient. In active transport, energy in the form of ATP is utilised to pump molecules against a concentration gradient across membranes. Water potential is the potential energy of water molecules which helps in the movement of water. It is determined by solute potential and pressure potential. The osmotic behaviour of cells depends on the surrounding solution. If the surrounding solution of the cell is hypertonic, it gets plasmolysed. The absorption of water by seeds and drywood takes place by a special type of diffusion called imbibition. In higher plants, there is a vascular system comprising of xylem and phloem, responsible for translocation. Water minerals and food cannot be moved within the body of a plant by diffusion alone. They are therefore, transported by a mass flow system ‚Äì movement of substance in bulk from one point to another as a result of pressure differences between the two points. Water absorbed by root hairs moves into the root tissue by two distinct pathways, i.e., apoplast and symplast. Various ions, and water from soil can be transported upto a small height in stems by root pressure. Transpiration pull model is the most acceptable to explain the transport of water. Transpiration is
 the loss of water in the form of vapours from the plant parts through stomata. Temperature, light, humidity, wind speed and number of stomata affect the rate of transpiration. Excess water is also removed through tips of leaves of plants by guttation. Phloem is responsible for transport of food (primarily) sucrose from the source to the sink. The translocation in phloem is bi-directional; the source-sink relationship is variable. The translocation in phloem is explained by the pressureflow hypothesis.

"What are the advantages and disadvantages of transpiration? ""Transpiration is a necessary evil"". Justify the statement.","Advantages of Transpiration: (i) Ascent of sap: Ascent of sap mostly occurs due to pull exerted by transpiration of water. (ii) Removal of excess water : It has been held that plants absorb far more amount of water than is actually required by them. Transpiration, therefore, removes the excess of water. (iii) Cooling effect : Radiant heat falling on the plants increases their temperature which may be dangerous to the plants. Transpiration, by evaporating water, lowers down their temperature. (iv) Mechanical tissue : The development of mechanical tissues which is essential for providing rigidity and strength to the plants, is favoured by the increase in transpiration. (v) Increasing Concentration of Mineral Salts : The sap absorbed from the soil contains low concentration of mineral salts. The loss of water through transpiration increases the concentration of mineral salts in the plant.  Disadvantages of Transpiration : (i) Wilting : Wilting or loss of turgidity is quite common during noon due to transpiration being higher than the rate of water absorption. Wilting reduces photosynthesis and other metabolic activities. (ii) Reduced Growth : Transpiration reduces availability of water inside the plant. Water deficit decreases the growth and hence the plant gives a stunted appearance. (iii) Abscissic Acid : Water stress produces abscisic acid. Abscissic acid prevents several plant processes and promotes abscission of leaves, flowers and fruits. (iv) Wastage of Energy : Since 98-99% of absorbed water is lost through transpiration, the energy used in absorption and conduction of water goes waste. (v) Modification : In order to reduce transpiration during critical periods, the plants produce several types of modification like thick cuticle, hair, prickles, spines, thons, sunken stomata, phylloclades, cladodes, etc.","11.4 TRANSPIRATION Transpiration is the evaporative loss of water by plants. It occurs mainly through stomata (sing. : stoma). Besides the loss of water vapour in transpiration, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the leaf also occurs through these stomata. Normally stomata are open in the day time and close during the night. The immediate cause of the opening or closing of stomata is a change in the turgidity of the guard cells. The inner wall of each guard cell, towards the pore or stomatal aperture, is thick and elastic. When turgidity increases within the two guard cells flanking each stomatal aperture or pore, the thin outer walls bulge out and force the inner walls into a crescent shape. The opening of the stoma is also aided due to the orientation of the microfibrils in the cell walls of the guard cells. Cellulose microfibrils are oriented radially rather than longitudinally making it easier for the stoma to open. When the guard cells lose turgor, due to water loss (or water stress) the elastic inner walls regain their original shape, the guard cells become flaccid and the stoma closes. Usually the lower surface of a dorsiventral (often dicotyledonous) leaf has a greater number of stomata while in an isobilateral (often monocotyledonous) leaf they are about equal on both surfaces. Transpiration is affected by several external factors: temperature, light, humidity, wind speed. Plant factors that affect transpiration include number and distribution of stomata, per cent of open stomata, water status of the plant, canopy structure etc. Figure11.8 A stomatal aperture with guard cells

Explain the mechanism of water absorption by plants.,"Plants absorb water by two distinct and independently operating methods : Passive absorption and Active absorption. (i) Passive absorption : (a) In this process, water is absorbed through the roots hairs rather than by the roots. (b) The root cells play a passive role or merely act as physical absorbing system. (c) The force for this type of water absorption originates in the aerial parts of the plant due to transpiration. It creates a tension or low water potential in the mesophyll cells of the leaves. (d) The latter, in turn, draw water from the xylem of the vascular bundle. Thus, water in the xylem is under pull or tension. It is called transpiration pull. (e) Due to the presence of continuous column of water from leaves to roots through xylem channel, the tension is transmitted to the xylem of roots and finally to root hair through endodermis and cortex. (f) Thus, a water potential gradient develops between the root hair cell and the soil solution. This results, movement of water across the root as a continuous stream. (ii) Active absorption : (a) Active absorption takes place by the activity of root itself, particularly root hairs. It utilizes metabolic energy. (b) A root hair cell functions as an osmotic system. Water is absorbed by the root hair due to osmotic differences between soil water and cell sap. (c) There exists a great difference in the osmotic pressure of the two sides or water potential gradient between the soil solution and cell sap. (d) The soil solution having less OP, has higher water potential than the cell sap with more OP. (e) Thus, water moves from the region of higher water potential towards the regions of lower water potential. (f) Water continues to enter the root hair cell as long as the water potential of the root cell sap is more negative than that of the soil solution. Water moves from cell to cell along the water potential gradient and reach up to endodermis and pericycle. (g) Finally water enters into the xylem.","11.3.1 How do Plants Absorb Water? We know that the roots absorb most of the water that goes into plants; obviously that is why we apply water to the soil and not on the leaves. The responsibility of absorption of water and minerals is more specifically the function of the root hairs that are present in millions at the tips of the roots. Root hairs are thin-walled slender extensions of root epidermal cells that greatly increase the surface area for absorption. Water is absorbed along with mineral solutes, by the root hairs, purely by diffusion. Once water is absorbed by the root hairs, it can move deeper into root layers by two distinct pathways:
 "
Explain the mechanism of uptake of minerals by the plants.,"Plants absorb minerals as ions. The rate of mineral absorption is independent of its concentration in the soil. It has two phases, the initial phase and the metabolic phase. In  metabolic phase, the ions pass into inner space (cytoplasm and vacuole) by two methods : (a) Passive absorption (b) Active absorption. (i) Passive mineral absorption : (a) It occur by the physical processes like diffusion. Diffusion do not involve any direct expenditure of metabolic energy. (b) There are ion channels in the membrane. (c) There are transmembrane proteins, which function as selective pores for the diffusion of ions. (d) Similarly there are aquaporins for the diffusion of water. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are also transported across the membrane passively. (ii) Active mineral absorption : (a) Active transport occurs through the agency of specific carriers present in the plasma membranes of the absorbing cells. It requires energy, which is supplied by ATP. (b) The enzymes at pores present on the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells use the energy of ATP to pump protons across the membrane. This establishes an electrochemical proton gradient that supplies energy for moving ions into the cells. (c) The cells of endodermis have many transport proteins embedded in their plasma membrane. (d) The active uptake of ions is partly responsible for the water potential gradient in roots, and therefore for the uptake of water by osmosis. (e) Ions diffuse down their concentration gradient from the epidermis to the xylem.  ","revealed that the process of absorption can be demarcated into two main phases. In the first phase, an initial rapid uptake of ions into the ‚Äòfree space‚Äô or ‚Äòouter space‚Äô of cells ‚Äì the apoplast, is passive. In the second phase of uptake, the ions are taken in slowly into the ‚Äòinner space‚Äô ‚Äì the symplast of the cells. The passive movement of ions into the apoplast usually occurs through ion-channels, the trans-membrane proteins that function as selective pores. On the other hand, the entry or exit of ions to and from the symplast requires the expenditure of metabolic energy, which is an active process. The movement of ions is usually called flux; the inward movement into the cells is influx and the outward movement, efflux. You have read the aspects of mineral nutrient uptake and translocation in plants in Chapter 11.

What are the general functions of blood ?,"The general functions of blood are : (i) Transport of Food Materials: Blood transports the digested food from the alimentary canal to the different body cells. (ii) Transport of Respiratory Gases: Oxygen is carried from the respiratory organs to the tissues and carbon dioxide from the tissue to the respiratory organs by blood. (iii) Transport of Hormones : Hormones are carried by blood from the endocrine glands to the places of use. (iv) Transport of Excretory Matter : Blood transports the excretory matter to the kidneys or other excretory organs. (v) Transport of Heat and temperature regulation : Blood allows the transfer of heat from the deeper tissue to surface of the body where it can be lost and this help in temperature regulation. (vi) Defence against infection : Some white blood corpuscles are phagocytic in action, however certain white blood corpuscles produce antitoxins to neutralize the toxins released by the foreign germs. (Any five)","You have learnt that all living cells have to be provided with nutrients, O2 and other essential substances. Also, the waste or harmful substances produced, have to be removed continuously for healthy functioning of tissues. It is therefore, essential to have efficient mechanisms for the movement of these substances to the cells and from the cells. Different groups of animals have evolved different methods for this transport. Simple organisms like sponges and coelenterates circulate water from their surroundings through their body cavities to facilitate the cells to exchange these substances. More complex organisms use special fluids within their bodies to transport such materials. Blood is the most commonly used body fluid by most of the higher organisms including humans for this purpose. Another body fluid, lymph, also helps in the transport of certain substances. In this chapter, you will learn about the composition and properties of blood and lymph (tissue fluid) and the mechanism of circulation of blood is also explained herein.

Where does cardiac impulse originate ? How is it conducted to the rest of the chambers ?,"Conducting system of Human heart: (i) Human heart acts as a pumping station. The heart beat is initiated by the Sino-atrial node (SAN) which lies near the opening of the superior vena cava.  (ii) The SAN acts as a pacemaker. When it is warmed or cooled the frequency of the heart beat is increased or decreased respectively. (iii) The excitation originated at the SA is picked up by another specialized muscle fibres, the AV node in the auricular septum. (iv) From the AV node the excitation travels through the special muscle fibres present in the septum dividing in the two ventricles. (v) This conducting bundle divides into two-right and left bundle. Each branch enters the ventricles through a fine network of the Purkinje fibres. (vi) All the conducting fibres are very specialized type of muscle fibres.","pulmonary artery and the aorta respectively are provided with the semilunar valves. The valves in the heart allows the flow of blood only in one direction, i.e., from the atria to the ventricles and from the ventricles to the pulmonary artery or aorta. These valves prevent any backward flow. The entire heart is made of cardiac muscles. The walls of ventricles are much thicker than that of the atria. A specialised cardiac musculature called the nodal tissue is also distributed in the heart (Figure 18.2). A patch of this tissue is present in the right upper corner of the right atrium called the sino-atrial node (SAN). Another mass of this tissue is seen in the lower left corner of the right atrium close to the atrio-ventricular septum called the atrio-ventricular node (AVN). A bundle of nodal fibres, atrioventricular bundle (AV bundle) continues from the AVN which passes through the atrio-ventricular septa to emerge on the top of the interventricular septum and immediately divides into a right and left bundle. These branches give rise to minute fibres throughout the ventricular musculature of the respective sides and are called purkinje fibres. The nodal musculature has the ability to generate action potentials without any external stimuli, i.e., it is autoexcitable. However, the number of action potentials that could be generated in a minute vary at different parts of the nodal system. The SAN can generate the maximum number of action potentials, i.e., 70-75 min‚Äì1, and is responsible for initiating and maintaining the rhythmic contractile activity of the heart. Therefore, it is called the pacemaker. Our heart normally beats 70-75 times in a minute (average 72 beats min‚Äì1).
 18.3.2 Cardiac Cycle How does the heart function? Let us take a look. To begin with, all the four chambers of heart are in a relaxed state, i.e., they are in joint diastole. As the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are open, blood from the pulmonary veins and vena cava flows into the left and the right ventricle respectively through the left and right atria. The semilunar valves are closed at this stage. The SAN now generates an action potential which stimulates both the atria to undergo a simultaneous contraction ‚Äì the atrial systole. This increases the flow of blood into the ventricles by about 30 per cent. The action potential is conducted to the ventricular side by the AVN and AV bundle from where the bundle of His transmits it through the entire ventricular musculature. This causes the ventricular muscles to contract, (ventricular systole), the atria undergoes relaxation (diastole), coinciding with the ventricular systole. Ventricular systole increases the ventricular pressure causing the closure of tricuspid and
 CARDIAC ACTIVITY
 Normal activities of the heart are regulated intrinsically, i.e., auto regulated by specialised muscles (nodal tissue), hence the heart is called myogenic. A special neural centre in the medulla oblangata can moderate the cardiac function through autonomic nervous system (ANS). Neural signals through the sympathetic nerves (part of ANS) can increase the rate of heart beat, the strength of ventricular contraction and thereby the cardiac output. On the other hand, parasympathetic neural signals (another component of ANS) decrease the rate of heart beat, speed of conduction of action potential and thereby the cardiac output. Adrenal medullary hormones can also increase the cardiac output.
 "
Describe the structure of human heart.,"(i) The heart is composed of two types of chambers. The upper two, small, thin walled chamber are the auricles or atria and receives blood from various parts of the body and lower two large, thick walled muscular ventricles that supply blood to various body organs. (ii) The two auricles are separated by inter-auricular septum. (iii) The right atrium receives the openings of superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and coronary sinus. (iv) The opening of inferior vena cava is guarded by eustachian valve. (v) The opening of the coronary sinus has Thebasian valve. (vi) The left auriculo-ventricular valve consists of two flaps and is termed bicuspid or mitral valve. (vii) The right auriculo-ventricular valve consists of three triangular flaps and is called tricuspid valve. (ix) The right and left ventricles are separated by interventricular septum. (x) The ventricles function as pumping chambers, thus they have thick muscles walls. (xi) Attached to the flaps of the bicuspid and tricuspid valves are special fibrous cords, the chordae tendineae, which are joined to the other ends with the special muscles of the ventricular wall, the papillary muscles. (x) The openings of the right and the left ventricles into the pulmonary atery and the aorla respectively are provided with the semilunar valves.","18.3.1 Human Circulatory System Human circulatory system, also called the blood vascular system consists of a muscular chambered heart, a network of closed branching blood vessels and blood, the fluid which is circulated. Heart, the mesodermally derived organ, is situated in the thoracic cavity, in between the two lungs, slightly tilted to the left. It has the size of a clenched fist. It is protected by a double walled membranous bag, pericardium, enclosing the pericardial fluid. Our heart has four chambers, two relatively small upper chambers called atria and two larger lower chambers called ventricles. A thin, muscular wall called the interatrial septum separates the right and the left atria, whereas a thick-walled, the inter-ventricular septum, separates the left and the right ventricles (Figure 18.2). The atrium and the ventricle of the same side are also separated by a thick fibrous tissue called the atrio-ventricular septum. However, each of these septa are provided with an opening through which the two chambers of the same side are connected. The opening between the right atrium and the right ventricle is guarded by a valve formed of three muscular flaps or cusps, the tricuspid valve, whereas a bicuspid or mitral valve guards the opening between the left atrium and the left ventricle. The openings of the right and the left ventricles into the

The action potential is conducted to the ventricular side by the AVN and AV bundle from where the bundle of His transmits it through the entire ventricular musculature.

Explain the working mechanism of heart.,"(i) The heart collects blood through both atria and then distributes it through ventricles. (ii) The action of heart includes contractions and relaxations of atria and ventricles respectively called as systole and diastole.  (iii) The right atrium receives.de-oxygenated blood from different parts of body and from the heart itself through the openings-superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and coronary sinus respectively. (iv) The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs through the openings of the pulmonary veins. (v) The deoxygenated and oxygenated bloods are forced into their respective ventricles. (vi) The contraction of atria is initiated and activated by SA node which spreads the wave of contraction through AV node which are latter transmitted to all parts of ventricles via bundle of His and Purkinje's fibres. (vii) During the contraction of ventricles the backward flow of blood into the atria is prevented by bicuspid and tricuspid valves. (viii) Thus, blood from the left ventricle and right ventricle is forced into the aorta and pulmonary trunk respectively. (ix) In this way the oxygenated blood is supplied to the various parts of the body including the heart itself.  ","pulmonary artery and the aorta respectively are provided with the semilunar valves. The valves in the heart allows the flow of blood only in one direction, i.e., from the atria to the ventricles and from the ventricles to the pulmonary artery or aorta. These valves prevent any backward flow. The entire heart is made of cardiac muscles. The walls of ventricles are much thicker than that of the atria. A specialised cardiac musculature called the nodal tissue is also distributed in the heart (Figure 18.2). A patch of this tissue is present in the right upper corner of the right atrium called the sino-atrial node (SAN). Another mass of this tissue is seen in the lower left corner of the right atrium close to the atrio-ventricular septum called the atrio-ventricular node (AVN). A bundle of nodal fibres, atrioventricular bundle (AV bundle) continues from the AVN which passes through the atrio-ventricular septa to emerge on the top of the interventricular septum and immediately divides into a right and left bundle. These branches give rise to minute fibres throughout the ventricular musculature of the respective sides and are called purkinje fibres. The nodal musculature has the ability to generate action potentials without any external stimuli, i.e., it is autoexcitable. However, the number of action potentials that could be generated in a minute vary at different parts of the nodal system. The SAN can generate the maximum number of action potentials, i.e., 70-75 min‚Äì1, and is responsible for initiating and maintaining the rhythmic contractile activity of the heart. Therefore, it is called the pacemaker. Our heart normally beats 70-75 times in a minute (average 72 beats min‚Äì1).
 18.3.2 Cardiac Cycle How does the heart function? Let us take a look. To begin with, all the four chambers of heart are in a relaxed state, i.e., they are in joint diastole. As the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are open, blood from the pulmonary veins and vena cava flows into the left and the right ventricle respectively through the left and right atria. The semilunar valves are closed at this stage. The SAN now generates an action potential which stimulates both the atria to undergo a simultaneous contraction ‚Äì the atrial systole. This increases the flow of blood into the ventricles by about 30 per cent. The action potential is conducted to the ventricular side by the AVN and AV bundle from where the bundle of His transmits it through the entire ventricular musculature.

Explain the following processes: (i) Polarisation of the membrane of a nerve fibre. (ii) Depolarisation of the membrane of a nerve fibre. (iii) Conduction of a nerve impulse along a nerve fibre. (iv) Transmission of a nerve impulse across a chemical synapse.,"When a neuron is not conducting an impulse, i.e., resting, the axonal membrane is more permeable to K+ and nearly impermeable to Na +. Similarly, the membrane is impermeable to negatively charged proteins present in the axoplasm. Consequently, the axoplasm contains high concentration of K + and negatively charged proteins and low concentration of Na +. In contrast, the fluid outside contains a low concentration of K+, a high concentration of Na and thus forms a concentration gradient. These ionic gradients across the resting membrane are maintained by the sodium-potassium pump. As a result, the outer surface of the axonal  membrane possesses a positive charge while its inner surface becomes negatively charged and therefore is polarised. (ii) Depolarization of the membrane of a nerve fibre: (a) Stimulation of an axon immediately enhances manifold its membrane permeability to Na +. As a result, Na+ ions diffuse across the membrane from the extracellular fluid (ECF) where their concentration is higher, to the interior of the fibre where the concentration is much lower. But the membrane permeability to K + starts rising somewhat later only, so there is simultaneous rise in the outward diffusion of K+ from the cell interior having a higher K + concentration. (b) These effects lower the overall cation concentration outside and enhance its concentration inside the membrane. (c) The membrane is, thus deposited, with its interior becoming electropositive to the exterior. (d) The depolarization spreads a local current. It induces nearby passive Na+ channels to open and so as to depolarize the nearby site. (e) Hence the initial depolarization passes outward over the membrane and spreads out in all directions from the site of stimulation. (iii) Conduction of nerve impulse along a nerve fibre: (a) It is a property of nerve fibre to become excited by a stimulus and then conduct that stimulus for the required and appropriate response. (b) In conducting a stimulus, the nerve axon has to pass through resting phase to active phase and then the recovery phase. (iv) Transmission of a Nerve impulse across a chemical Synapse: (a) The physiological junction between two neurons across which nerve impulses can be transmitted is known as synapse. (b) Synapse occur between the knob like axon endings of one neuron and the dendrites of cell body of another. (c) At the junction of two neurons a narrow fluid filled space called synaptic cleft is present. (d) Knob like endings of one neuron form many membrane bound vesicles called synaptic vesicles. (e) Since they help in the transmission of nerve impulse, they are also called as neurotransmitters. (f) When a nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal the synaptic vesicles get stimulated and release their stored chemicals in the synaptic cleft. These chemicals then diffuse through these clefts to reach the membrane of the next neurons and stimulate the next neurons.","becomes negatively charged and therefore is polarised. The electrical potential difference across the resting plasma membrane is called as the resting potential. You might be curious to know about the mechanisms of generation of nerve impulse and its conduction along an axon. When a stimulus is applied at a site (Figure 21.2 e.g., point A) on the polarised membrane, the membrane at the site A becomes freely permeable to Na+. This leads to a rapid influx of Na+ followed by the reversal of the polarity at that site, i.e., the outer surface of the membrane becomes negatively charged and the inner side becomes positively charged. The polarity of the membrane at the site A is thus reversed and hence depolarised. The electrical potential difference across the plasma membrane at the site A is called the action potential, which is in fact termed as a nerve impulse. At sites immediately ahead, the axon (e.g., site B) membrane has a positive charge on the outer surface and a negative charge on its inner surface. As a result, a current flows on the inner surface from site A to site B. On the outer surface current flows from site B to site A (Figure 21.2) to complete the circuit of current flow. Hence, the polarity at the site is reversed, and an action potential is generated at site B. Thus, the impulse (action potential) generated at site A arrives at site B. The sequence is repeated along the length of the axon and consequently the impulse is conducted. The rise in the stimulus-induced permeability to Na+ is extremely shortlived. It is quickly followed by a rise in permeability to K+. Within a fraction of a second, K+ diffuses outside the membrane and restores the resting potential of the membrane at the site of excitation and the fibre becomes once more responsive to further stimulation.

Explain what are simple sensory receptors and special sensory receptors.,"There are five senses: touch, vision, hearing, smell and taste. While touch is a complex general sense, the other four are special senses. The general sensory receptors are simple receptors that are mostly modified dendritic ends of sensory neurons. Such receptors are present throughout the body: in the skin, mucous membranes, connective tissues and muscles. These monitor most of the types of general sensory information such as tactile sensation (a mix of touch, pressure, stretch and vibration), heat, cold, pain and muscle sense (perception). In contrast, special sensory receptors are distinct receptor cells that are actually confined to the head region and are highly localized within complex sensory organs like eyes  and ears and tissues of the taste buds and olfactory epithelium. These sensory organs and tissues are collection of cells of many different types (receptor and non-receptor cells), working together to accomplish a specific receptive process.","Sense Organs We smell things by our nose, taste by tongue, hear by ear and see objects by eyes. The nose contains mucus-coated receptors which are specialised for receiving the sense of smell and called olfactory receptors. These are made up of olfactory epithelium that consists of three kinds of cells. The neurons of the olfactory epithelium extend from the outside environment directly into a pair of broad bean-sized organs, called olfactory bulb, which are extensions of the brain‚Äôs limbic system. Both nose and tongue detect dissolved chemicals. The chemical senses of gustation (taste) and olfactory (smell) are functionally similar and interrelated. The tongue detects tastes through taste buds, containing gustatory receptors. With each taste of food or sip of drink, the brain integrates the differential input from the taste buds and a complex flavour is perceived. In the following sections, you will be introduced to the structure and functioning of the eye (sensory organ for vision) and the ear (sensory organ for hearing).
 "
Explain the sense of smell (olfaction).,"Sense of smell (olfaction): Nose contains the receptors of smell, in the mucous coated thin, yellowish patch of olfactory epithelium. It is located way up at the roof of the nasal cavity on either sides of the nasal septum.  Fig. Human nose showing olfactory bulb and magnified view of olfactory epithelium The olfactory epithelium contains three types of cells: (i) millions of olfactory receptor cells; (ii) columnar supportive cells; (iii) short basal cells. Olfactory receptors are unusual bipolar sensory neurons. The thin dendrites of each of these neurons run to the surface of the epithelium where these bear a cluster of about 20 modified cilia which function as receptor sites. These cilia extend from the olfactory epithelium into the thin coat of nasal mucous secreted by the supportive cells and olfactory glands. This mucous is a solvent that captures and dissolves the air borne odour molecules. Once dissolved, the chemicals bind to the specific receptors on the cilia stimulating he receptor cells. This causes depolarization and ultimately action potential in the receptor cell. The axons of the olfactory receptors unite to form the olfactory nerve which transmits the information directly to the overlying olfactory bulb, a relay station in the brain. Unlike receptor ends of other senses, the axons of the olfactory receptors directly extend from the outside environment (the nasal cavity) into the olfactory  bulb, a part of the brain. The number of receptors stimulated indicates the strength of the stimulus. As with taste, some of the smell, can be really painful. The nasal cavity contains pain receptors that respond to irritants such as ammonia, vinegar or hot chilly pepper. Impulses from these pain receptors reach the brain. The brain combines these sensations with those of smell to identify the odours. Although humans do have a good sense of smell - we can detect about 10,000 different odours.","Sense Organs We smell things by our nose, taste by tongue, hear by ear and see objects by eyes.

Explain the sense of touch.,"Sense of touch: Skin is the sensory organ for touch and is also the largest sense organ. Our sense of touch allows us to feel light sensation like the touch of a feather as well as a heavy sensation like a stone falling on the toe. These sensations come from millions of microscopic simple sensory receptors located all over the skin and associated with the general sensations of contact or pressure, heat, cold, and pain. The receptors are located at different levels within the skin and distributed unevenly. Some parts of the body have a large number of these such as the finger tips, making them more sensitive. Structurally, these touch receptors are either free dendritic endings or encapsulated dendritic endings present in the skin (and other parts of the body). When stimulated, these transmit the sensation to the brain. Given below is a list of some of these receptors present in the skin. (i) Free or bare dendritic nerve endings are present throughout the epidermis taking an extensive branching or ""zigzag"" form. These respond chiefly to pain and temperature but some respond to pressure as well. The root hair plexuses, network of free nerve endings that surround hair follicles, are light touch receptors that detect bending of hairs. (ii) Meissner's corpuscles are located in the papillary layer of the dermis just below the epidermis, which respond to touch our skin. (iii) Pacinian corpuscles are scattered deep in the dermis and in the subcutaneous tissue of the skin. These are stimulated by deep pressure. These receptors are best suited to monitor vibrations, on-off pressure. (iv) Ruffini's corpuscles respond to heat. (v) Krause's corpuscles are excited by cold and are found in large numbers in the face and hands.","Sense Organs We smell things by our nose, taste by tongue, hear by ear and see objects by eyes.

 "
Explain the sense of taste (gustation).,"Sense of taste (gustation): The sense of taste and smell work closely together. If we cannot smell something we cannot taste it either. One reason why we cannot taste (or smell) food well with a common cold is that with the nasal passages inflamed and coated with thick mucus layer the smell receptors are practically nonfunctional. The receptor cells for taste are located in taste buds. Humans have about 10,000 taste buds. The majority of taste buds are located in pockets around the papillae (peg-like projections of the mucous membrane) on the surface and sides of the tongue, but there are some on the surface of the pharynx and the larynx. Each taste bud contains about 40 specialized receptor cells or gustatory cells, many more supporting cells and some basal cells that replace the worn out cells of the taste buds. Unlike the receptors for smell, that are modified sensory neurons, the receptor cells for taste are not neurons, but rather specialized cells with slender microvilli on their outer ends. The  microvilli protrude into the surrounding fluids through a narrow opening called the taste pore. Dissolved chemicals contacting the microvilli bind to specific receptor present on the microvilli, thereby depolarizing the cell. The dendrites of the associated sensory neurons coil intimately around the receptor cells and synapse with them so that, when a receptor cell is stimulated and depolarized, it releases neurotransmitter which leads to the generation of an action potential in the associated sensory neuron. Each dendrite receives signals from several receptor cells within the taste bud. Nerve fibers emerging from the taste buds pass to the brain stem. From here the nerve impulse is relayed to the taste centre in the cerebral cortex of the brain that perceives the taste sensation. Normally our taste sensations are complicated mixture of qualities. In humans, there are f our basic taste senses: sweet, sour, salt, and bitter. The receptors for these four basic tastes have their areas of greatest concentration on different parts of the tongue: sweet and salty on the front bitter on the back, and sour on the sides. A few substances stimulate only one of the four types of receptors, but most stimulate two, three, or all four types to varying degrees. The sensation and flavour of the food we experience are thus produced by a combination of these four basic sensations, modified by accompanying sensations of smell, texture and temperature.

","and/or take part in various metabolic processes. Deficiency of each of these essential elements may lead to symptoms called deficiency symptoms. Chlorosis, necrosis, stunted growth, impaired cell division, etc., are some prominent deficiency symptoms. Plants absorb minerals through roots by either passive or active processes. They are carried to all parts of the organism through xylem along with water transport. Nitrogen is very essential for the sustenance of life. Plants cannot use atmospheric nitrogen directly. But some of the plants in association with N2-fixing bacteria, especially roots of legumes, can fix this atmospheric nitrogen into biologically usable forms. Nitrogen fixation requires a strong reducing agent and energy in the form of ATP. N2-fixation is accomplished with the help of nitrogenfixing microbes, mainly Rhizobium. The enzyme nitrogenase which plays an important role in biological N2 fixation is very sensitive to oxygen. Most of the processes take place in anaerobic environment. The energy, ATP, required is provided by the respiration of the host cells. Ammonia produced following N2 fixation is incorporated into amino acids as the amino group.

How can you distinguish hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism? (KVS Silchar 2017),"(i) Hyperthyroidism is increased levels of thyroid hormones whereas hypothyroidism is decreased levels of thyroid hormones.

(v) Hypothyroidism shows decreased levels of T3 and T4 and increased levels of TSH whereas in hyperthyroidism, there is an increased levels of T3 and T4 and a decreased level of TSH.","Thyroid Gland
 The thyroid gland is composed of two lobes which are located on either side of the trachea (Figure 22.3). Both the lobes are interconnected with a thin flap of connective tissue called isthmus. The thyroid gland is composed of follicles and stromal tissues. Each thyroid follicle is composed of follicular cells, enclosing a cavity. These follicular cells synthesise two hormones, tetraiodothyronine or thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Iodine is essential for the normal rate of hormone synthesis in the thyroid. Deficiency of Figure 22.3 Diagrammatic view of the iodine in our diet results in hypothyroidism and position of Thyroid and enlargement of the thyroid gland, commonly called Parathyroid (a) Ventral side goitre. Hypothyroidism during pregnancy causes (b) Dorsal side defective development and maturation of the growing
 baby leading to stunted growth (cretinism), mental retardation, low intelligence quotient, abnormal skin, deaf-mutism, etc. In adult women, hypothyroidism may cause menstrual cycle to become irregular. Due to cancer of the thyroid gland or due to development of nodules of the thyroid glands, the rate of synthesis and secretion of the thyroid hormones is increased to abnormal high levels leading to a condition called hyperthyroidism which adversely affects the body physiology. Exopthalmic goitre is a form of hyperthyroidism, characterised by enlargement of the thyroid gland, protrusion of the eyeballs, increased basal metabolic rate, and weight loss, also called Graves‚Äô disease. Thyroid hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basal metabolic rate. These hormones also support the process of red blood cell formation. Thyroid hormones control the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Maintenance of water and electrolyte balance is also influenced by thyroid hormones. Thyroid gland also secretes a protein hormone called thyrocalcitonin (TCT) which regulates the blood calcium levels.

Insulin also stimulates conversion of glucose to glycogen (glycogenesis) in the target cells. The glucose homeostasis in blood is thus maintained jointly by the two ‚Äì insulin and glucagons. Prolonged hyperglycemia leads to a complex disorder called diabetes mellitus which is associated with loss of glucose through urine and formation of harmful compounds known as ketone bodies. Diabetic patients are successfully treated with insulin therapy.

Enzymes They may act at site where they are produced or carried to another site for action. They have high molecular weight. They speed up the reactions. They are effective in low concentration and can increase the reaction with an increase in the concentration. Enzyme controlled reactions are reversible. ,"22.1 ENDOCRINE GLANDS AND HORMONES Endocrine glands lack ducts and are hence, called ductless glands. Their secretions are called hormones. The classical definition of hormone as a chemical produced by endocrine glands and released into the blood and transported to a distantly located target organ has current scientific definition as follows: Hormones are non-nutrient chemicals which act as intercellular messengers and are produced in trace amounts. The new definition covers a number of new molecules in addition to the hormones secreted by the organised endocrine glands. Invertebrates possess very simple endocrine systems with few hormones whereas a large number of chemicals act as hormones and provide coordination in the vertebrates. The human endocrine system is described here.

Explain the structure of pancreas and also mention the roles of the hormone secreted by it. ,"Structure of Pancreas : The pancreas lies inferior to the stomach in the first C-shaped bend of the duodenum. It acts both an exocrine and endocrine gland and thus is a composite gland. The tissue of the pancreas has in addition to the acinar cells, groups of cells called islets of Langerhans, which produce endocrine secretions. Four kinds of cells that have been identified in the islets : (a) Alpha cells produce glucagon, (a) Beta cells produce insulin, (c) Delta cells produce somatostatin, (d) PP cells produce pancreatic polypeptide. Hormone of Pancreas and their Roles : (i) Glucagon : It stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose. It is controlled by feedback in accordance with the glucose in the blood. (ii) Insulin : It is antagonistic to glucagon. Insulin decreases the level of glucose in the blood. It acts by increasing the rate at which glucose is transported out of the blood and into cells and by stimulating muscles cells to take up sugar from the blood and convert it to glycogen. (iii) Somatostatin : It suppresses the release of other hormones from the pancreas. It also appears to suppress the release of hormone from the digestive tract. (iv) Pancreatic polypeptide : It appears that pancreatic polypeptide inhibits the release of digestive secretion of the pancreas. ","22.2.8 Pancreas Pancreas is a composite gland (Figure 22.1) which acts as both exocrine and endocrine gland. The endocrine pancreas consists of ‚ÄòIslets of Langerhans‚Äô. There are about 1 to 2 million Islets of Langerhans in a normal human pancreas representing only 1 to 2 per cent of the pancreatic tissue. The two main types of cells in the Islet of Langerhans are called Œ±-cells and Œ≤-cells. The Œ±-cells secrete a hormone called glucagon, while the Œ≤-cells secrete insulin. Glucagon is a peptide hormone, and plays an important role in maintaining the normal blood glucose levels. Glucagon acts mainly on the liver cells (hepatocytes) and stimulates glycogenolysis resulting in an increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia). In addition, this hormone stimulates the process of gluconeogenesis which also contributes to hyperglycemia. Glucagon reduces the cellular glucose uptake and utilisation. Thus, glucagon is a hyperglycemic hormone. Insulin is a peptide hormone, which plays a major role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Insulin acts mainly on hepatocytes and adipocytes (cells of adipose tissue), and enhances cellular glucose

It regulates uterine contraction of smooth muscles during child birth. (ii) Ovulation : Luetinizing Hormone (LH) secreted by anterior pituitary (adenolypophysis) regulates the ovulation. (iii) Rise in blood sugar : Insulin secreted by Islets of Langerhans regulate rise in blood sugar. (iv) Fall in calcium ion level in blood : Parathormone secreted by parathyroid gland regulate rise in blood sugar. (v) Urinary elimination of water : ADH secreted by posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis) is called vasopressin. It decreases the volume of water by increasing reabsorption from urine.,"As you know, the hypothalamus is the basal part of diencephalon, forebrain (Figure 22.1) and it regulates a wide spectrum of body functions. It contains Figure 22.1 Location of endocrine glands several groups of neurosecretory cells called nuclei which produce hormones. These hormones regulate the synthesis and secretion of pituitary hormones. However, the hormones produced by hypothalamus are of two types, the releasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary hormones) and the inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of pituitary hormones). For example a hypothalamic hormone called Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates the pituitary synthesis and release of gonadotrophins. On the other hand, somatostatin from the hypothalamus inhibits the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. These hormones originating in the hypothalamic neurons, pass through axons and are released from their nerve endings. These hormones reach the pituitary gland through a portal circulatory system and regulate the functions of the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is under the direct neural regulation of the hypothalamus (Figure 22.2).

Illustrate the summary of the hormones secreted by hypothalamus. (Any five),The neurosecretory cells (neurons) of hypothalamus secrete hormones called neurohormones (releasing factors) which are summarised below. (i) Adrenocorticotropic releasing hormone (ACTRH) : It stimulates the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). (ii) Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH): It stimulates the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland to secrete thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) or thyrotropin. (iii) Somatotropin Releasing hormone (SRH) : It stimulates the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland to release growth hormone (GH) or somatotropin. (iv) Growth inhibiting hormone (GIH): This hormone is also called somatostatin (SS). It inhibits the secretion of growth hormone from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. (v) Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) : It stimulates the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland to secrete two gonadotropic hormones : follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). (Any five) ,"As you know, the hypothalamus is the basal part of diencephalon, forebrain (Figure 22.1) and it regulates a wide spectrum of body functions. It contains Figure 22.1 Location of endocrine glands several groups of neurosecretory cells called nuclei which produce hormones. These hormones regulate the synthesis and secretion of pituitary hormones. However, the hormones produced by hypothalamus are of two types, the releasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary hormones) and the inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of pituitary hormones). For example a hypothalamic hormone called Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates the pituitary synthesis and release of gonadotrophins. On the other hand, somatostatin from the hypothalamus inhibits the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. These hormones originating in the hypothalamic neurons, pass through axons and are released from their nerve endings. These hormones reach the pituitary gland through a portal circulatory system and regulate the functions of the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is under the direct neural regulation of the hypothalamus (Figure 22.2).

","22.1 ENDOCRINE GLANDS AND HORMONES Endocrine glands lack ducts and are hence, called ductless glands. Their secretions are called hormones. The classical definition of hormone as a chemical produced by endocrine glands and released into the blood and transported to a distantly located target organ has current scientific definition as follows: Hormones are non-nutrient chemicals which act as intercellular messengers and are produced in trace amounts. The new definition covers a number of new molecules in addition to the hormones secreted by the organised endocrine glands. Invertebrates possess very simple endocrine systems with few hormones whereas a large number of chemicals act as hormones and provide coordination in the vertebrates. The human endocrine system is described here.

Give a brief account of the hormones secreted by adrenal cortex.,"Adrenal cortex secretes cortical steroids that are grouped into three catagories: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids and gonadocorticoids. (i) Mineralocorticoids : (a) These hormones are secreted by the cells of zona glomerulosa or adrenal cortex. (b) Aldosterone (salt-retaining hormone) is the principal mineralocorticoid in humans. Its main function is to regulate the balance of water and electrolytes in our body. Aldosterone acts mainly at the renal tubules and stimulates the reabsorption ion of Na + and water and excretion of K + and phosphate ions. (ii) Glucocorticoids : (a) They effect carbohydrate metabolism, however, they also affect the metabolism of proteins and fats. Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and proteolysis and inhibit cellular uptake and utilisation of amino acids. (iii) Gonadocorticoids : (a) They are also called sex hormones of adrenal glands. (b) These male sex hormones are called androgens which are important in the development of a male foetus. (c) A male foetus develops normal male characteristics only if the foetal gonads and adrenal glands produced sufficient quantities of androgens (d) Androgens stimulate the development of male secondary sexual characters like distribution of body hair. (f) Female sex hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex are oestrogens which maintain the development of female secondary sexual characters.","an increased concentration of glucose in blood. In addition, they also stimulate the breakdown of lipids and proteins. The adrenal cortex can be divided into three layers, called zona reticularis (inner layer), zona fasciculata (middle layer) and zona glomerulosa (outer layer). The adrenal cortex secretes many hormones, commonly called as corticoids. The corticoids, which are involved in carbohydrate metabolism are called glucocorticoids. In our body, cortisol is the main glucocorticoid. Corticoids, which regulate the balance of water and electrolytes in our body are called mineralocorticoids. Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid in our body. Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and proteolysis; and inhibit cellular uptake and utilisation of amino acids. Cortisol is also involved in maintaining the cardio-vascular system as well as the kidney functions. Glucocorticoids, particularly cortisol, produces antiinflammatory reactions and suppresses the immune response. Cortisol stimulates the RBC production. Aldosterone acts mainly at the renal tubules and stimulates the reabsorption of Na+ and water and excretion of K+ and phosphate ions. Thus, aldosterone helps in the maintenance of electrolytes, body fluid volume, osmotic pressure and blood pressure. Small amounts of androgenic steroids are also secreted by the adrenal cortex which play a role in the growth of axial hair, pubic hair and facial hair during puberty.

What are the hormones produced by anterior pituitary ? What function does each serve ?,"The principal hormone produced by anterior lobe of pituitary are following : (i) Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) : It stimulates the testis in man to produce sperms i.e., spermatogenesis and ovaries in female to produce ova (oogenesis). It also stimulates ovaries to secrete female sex hormone called estrogens.  (ii) Luteinizing Hormone (LH): It stimulates testis to secrete male sex hormone named androgens and testosterone. It also stimulates ovaries to secrete the female sex hormone called progesterone. In females together with FSH it triggers ovulation, stimulates conversion of ovarian follicles into corpus luteum which secretes oestrogen and progesterone. (iii) Prolactin Hormone (PLH) or Luteotropic Hormone (LTH) : It stimulates milk production and secretion, reproduction, osmoregulation, growth and metabolism. (iv) Thyroid stimulating hormone : It stimulates the growth of thyroid gland and the secretions of thyroid hormones. (v) Adrenocorticotropic Hormone: It stimulates the adrenal cortex to grow and secrete glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and gonadocorticoids. (vi) Growth Hormone (GH) : It stimulates growth of a body by stimulating retention of proteins and calcium in the body, synthesis and deposition of proteins in tissues, growth and elongation in long bones and proportionate growth of muscles and visceral organs. (vii) Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (MSH) : It appears to be functional only in cold blooded animals such as fishes, amphibians and reptiles. It makes the skin darker or lighter so that animals can protect themselves from the attack of enemies.","Hypothalamic The pituitary gland is located in a bony cavity neurons called sella tursica and is attached to hypothalamus by a stalk (Figure 22.2). It is divided anatomically into an adenohypophysis and a neurohypophysis. Adenohypophysis consists of two portions, pars distalis and pars intermedia. The pars distalis region of pituitary, commonly called anterior pituitary, produces growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid Portal circulation stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle Posterior stimulating hormone (FSH). Pars intermedia pituitary secretes only one hormone called melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH). However, in Anterior humans, the pars intermedia is almost merged pituitary with pars distalis. Neurohypophysis (pars nervosa) also known as posterior pituitary, stores Figure 22.2 Diagrammatic representation of pituitary and its relationship with and releases two hormones called oxytocin and hypothalamus vasopressin, which are actually synthesised by the hypothalamus and are transported axonally to neurohypophysis. Over-secretion of GH stimulates abnormal growth of the body leading to gigantism and low secretion of GH results in stunted growth resulting in pituitary dwarfism. Excess secretion of growth hormone in adults especially in middle age can result in severe disfigurement (especially of the face) called Acromegaly, which may lead to serious complications, and premature death if unchecked. The disease is hard to diagnose in the early stages and often goes undetected for many years, until changes in external features become noticeable. Prolactin regulates the growth of the mammary glands and formation of milk in them. TSH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. ACTH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones called glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. LH and FSH stimulate gonadal activity and hence are called gonadotrophins. In males, LH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of hormones called androgens from testis. In males, FSH and androgens regulate spermatogenesis. In females, LH induces ovulation of fully mature follicles (graafian follicles) and maintains the corpus luteum, formed from the remnants of the graafian follicles

Write any five reasons by which a person can become type 2 diabetes patients. (KVS Silchar 2017),"Following are the five reasons : (i) Insulin resistance is the most common cause of type 2 diabetes. (ii) It can be hereditary. (iii) Lifestyle choices that affect the development of type 2 diabetes include : (a) Lack of exercise : Physical activity has many benefits-one of them being that it can help you avoid type 2 diabetes, if you're susceptible. (b) Unhealthy meal planning choices : A meal plan filled with high-fat foods and lacking in fibre increases the likelihood of type 2 diabetes. (c) Overweight/Obesity : Lack of exercise and unhealthy meal planning choices can lead to obesity, or make it worse. Being overweight makes it more likely that you'll become insulin resistant and can also lead to many other healthy conditions.","Which hormonal deficiency is responsible for the following: (a) Diabetes mellitus

Explain the following : (i) Insulin lowers the blood sugar level. (ii) Hypothalamus and pituitary function as an integrated and co-ordinated system. (iii) Body growth is generally accelerated at puberty in the male.,"(i) Insulin hormone is secreted by pancreatic islets. Insulin increases the utilization of glucose in tissues and facilitates the storage of glucose as glycogen in muscles and liver. By these actions insulin lowers the blood sugar level.  (ii) It is fact that Hypothalamus and Pituitary function as an integrated coordinated system. In hypothalamus, the hormones are synthesized in the neurosecretory cells body and then transported along the axon to its tip where the hormones are stored in droplets. Hypothalamic neuro-secreting cells secrete several hormones called neurohormones into this blood. These reach the anterior pituitary through the portal blood and control the secretion of hormones by the cells of that gland. For example : Thyrotropin releasing hormone, corticotropin releasing hormone and gonadotropin releasing hormone of hypothalamus stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete the hormones called thyrotropin, corticotropin and gonadotropins respectively. On the other hand the hormone somatostatin of the hypothalamus inhibits the secretion of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary. (iii) Sex hormones are secreted near the age of puberty or sexual maturity. Testosterone stimulates the development of the external male sex characters such as beards, moustaches, and low pitch male voice in man. Thus, testosterone promotes the growth of many body tissues including bones and muscles. Androgens are such substances which stimulate the development of male sex characters.

(b) Blood vessels, lymph vessels, nerves and ureter enter or leave the kidney through the hilum. (c) They are situated in the anterior part of the abdominal cavity one on either side of the median line. (d) Last two pair of ribs (floating ribs) protect the kidneys. (e) The concave side of each kidney faces inwards and convex side outwards. (f) The right kidney is slightly lower than the left and the left kidney is little nearer to the middle plane than the right. (g) The kidney is metanephric. (ii) Ureters: (a) The ureter of each kidney leaves from the renal pelvis in the hilum region. (b) They are narrow, tubular structures, and open into the urinary bladder. (c) They carry urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. (iii) Urinary bladder: (a) It lies in the pelvic cavity and is pear shaped, muscular, sac-like structure. (b) The muscular layer of the urinary bladder is well developed. The latter consists of three layers of smooth muscle-inner and outer layer of longitudinal fibres and middle layer of circular fibres. (c) Both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems innervate the urinary bladder. (d) The urinary bladder stores urine temporarily. (iv) Urethra: (a) It is a canal like structure which extends from the neck of the bladder and leads to exterior. (b) It opens by urethral orifice infront of vaginal aperture (genital aperture). (c) In male, urethra is much longer which opens out at the tip of the penis by urinogenital aperture. (d) Thus the urethra of male carries both urine and semen. ","19.1 HUMAN EXCRETORY SYSTEM In humans, the excretory system consists of a pair of kidneys, one pair of ureters, a urinary bladder and a urethra (Figure 19.1). Kidneys are reddish brown, bean shaped structures situated between the levels of last thoracic and third lumbar vertebra close to the dorsal inner wall of the abdominal cavity. Each kidney of an adult human measures 10-12 cm in length, 5-7 cm in width, 2-3 cm in thickness with an average weight of 120170 g. Towards the centre of the inner concave surface of the kidney is a notch called hilum through which ureter, blood vessels and nerves enter. Inner to the hilum is a broad funnel shaped space called the renal pelvis with projections called calyces. The outer layer of kidney is a tough capsule. Inside the kidney, there are two zones, an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The medulla is divided into a few conical masses (medullary pyramids) projecting into the calyces (sing.: calyx). The cortex extends in between the

"Difference between Ammonotelism, Ureotelism and Uricotelism.","S. Ammonotelism No. (i) Excretory waste is ammonia (NH3). (ii) It is characteristic of aquatic animals such as protozoans, sponges, coelenterates, crustaceans, bony fishes and echinoderms etc. (iii)  Excess of water is required to eliminate ammonia. It is highly toxic.  (iv)  Water loss is about 300-500 ml to remove one gram of ammonia.  (v)  Ammonia is formed in liver cells by the deamination of the amino acids.  Ureotelism  Uricotelism  Excretory waste is urea (NH2-CO-NH2). It is characteristic of mammals, cartilaginous fishes (e.g., dogfish) and amphibians etc.  Excretory waste is uric acid. It is characteristic of terrestrial reptiles and insects. All the birds are uricotelic.  Less water is needed, urea is less toxic than ammonia. It can be retained for some time in body without any harmful effect. Water loss is about 50 ml to eliminate one gram of urea.  Much less water is needed. Uric acid is least toxic.  Urea is formed in liver by detoxification of ammonia.  Water loss is about 10 ml to excrete out one gram of uric acid. Uric acid is formed mainly from the purines in liver cells. In insects, uric acid is formed in malpighian tubules. ","Animals accumulate ammonia, urea, uric acid, carbon dioxide, water and ions like Na+, K+, Cl‚Äì, phosphate, sulphate, etc., either by metabolic activities or by other means like excess ingestion. These substances have to be removed totally or partially. In this chapter, you will learn the mechanisms of elimination of these substances with special emphasis on common nitrogenous wastes. Ammonia, urea and uric acid are the major forms of nitrogenous wastes excreted by the animals. Ammonia is the most toxic form and requires large amount of water for its elimination, whereas uric acid, being the least toxic, can be removed with a minimum loss of water. The process of excreting ammonia is Ammonotelism. Many bony fishes, aquatic amphibians and aquatic insects are ammonotelic in nature. Ammonia, as it is readily soluble, is generally excreted by diffusion across body surfaces or through gill surfaces (in fish) as ammonium ions. Kidneys do not play any significant role in its removal. Terrestrial adaptation necessitated the production of lesser toxic nitrogenous wastes like urea and uric acid for conservation of water. Mammals, many terrestrial amphibians and marine fishes mainly excrete urea and are called ureotelic animals. Ammonia produced by metabolism is converted into urea in the liver of these animals and released into the blood which is filtered and excreted out by the kidneys. Some amount of urea may be retained in the kidney matrix of some of these animals to maintain a desired osmolarity. Reptiles, birds, land snails and insects excrete nitrogenous wastes as uric acid in the form of pellet or paste with a minimum loss of water and are called uricotelic animals.

"Describe briefly the regulation of kidney function by the following. (i) ADH, (ii) ANE (iii) Renin","Regulation of Kidney: (i) ADH: Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is secreted by hypothalamus of the brain and released into the blood from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. The release of ADH is triggered when osmo-receptors in the hypothalamus detect an increase in the osmolarity of the blood above a set point of 300 osmo mL-1. In this situation the osmoreceptors cells also promote thirst. It increases the reabsorption of water in the DCT and collecting duct. (ii) ANF: Atrial natriuretic factor is another hormone which opposes the regulation by RAAS. The walls of the artery of the heart release ANF in response to an increase in blood volume and pressure. ANF inhibits release of renin from the JG cells and thereby inhibits NaCl reabsorption by the collecting duct and reduces aldosterone release from the adrenal gland. Thus ADH, RAAS and ANF regulate the function of the kidneys. As a result they control body fluid osmolarity, salt concentration, blood pressure and blood volume. (iii) Renin: The smooth muscle cells of both the afferent and efferent arterioles are swollen and contain dark granules. These cells are called juxtaglomerular cells. A fall in glomerular blood flow or glomerular blood pressure activate the JG cells to release renin. Renin converts angiotensinogen in blood into angiotensin II. The later increases blood pressure. Angiotensin  also stimulates the secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex, thus infusing the reabsorption of sodium ions by the DCT and that of water through collecting ducts.","KIDNEY FUNCTION
 The functioning of the kidneys is efficiently monitored and regulated by hormonal feedback mechanisms involving the hypothalamus, JGA and to a certain extent, the heart. Osmoreceptors in the body are activated by changes in blood volume, body fluid volume and ionic concentration. An excessive loss of fluid from the body can activate these receptors which stimulate the hypothalamus to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin from the neurohypophysis. ADH facilitates water reabsorption from latter parts of the tubule, thereby preventing diuresis. An increase in body fluid volume can switch off the osmoreceptors and suppress the ADH release to complete the feedback. ADH can also affect the kidney function by its constrictory effects on blood vessels. This causes an increase in blood pressure. An increase in blood pressure can increase the glomerular blood flow and thereby the GFR. The JGA plays a complex regulatory role. A fall in glomerular blood flow/glomerular blood pressure/GFR can activate the JG cells to release renin which converts angiotensinogen in blood to angiotensin I and further to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, being a powerful vasoconstrictor, increases the glomerular blood pressure and thereby GFR. Angiotensin II also activates the adrenal cortex to release Aldosterone. Aldosterone causes reabsorption of Na+ and water from the distal parts of the tubule. This also leads to an increase in blood pressure and GFR. This complex mechanism is generally known as the Renin-Angiotensin mechanism. An increase in blood flow to the atria of the heart can cause the release of Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF). ANF can cause vasodilation (dilation of blood vessels) and thereby decrease the blood pressure. ANF mechanism, therefore, acts as a check on the renin-angiotensin mechanism.

Explain the process of urine formation in human being. ,"Urine formation includes three processes: (i) Ultrafiltration, (ii) Selective reabsorption, (iii) Selective Secretion. (i) Ultrafiltration: It is filtration which occurs under high blood pressure. The afferent arteriole supplies blood to glomerulus and efferent arteriole collects blood from glomerulus. Therefore, the blood pressure in glomerulus becomes 75 mm of Hg. The smaller molecules of glucose, water, salts, ammonia etc. diffuse from glomerulus to Bowman's capsule and this process is called ultrafiltration. About 1.5-2.5% of water and solutes are removed from the blood plasma that flows through glomerulus. The quantity of glomerular filtrate formed each minutes in all nephrons of both kidneys is called the glomerular filtration rate. In a normal person, the glomerular filtration rate is about 125ml. per minute. (ii) Selective reabsorption: It is the process by which useful material are absorbed by the blood from glomerular filtrate. The tubular epithelial cells in different segments of nephron perform this either by active or passive mechanisms. Substances like glucose, amino acids, Na+, etc., in the filtrate are reabsorbed actively where as the nitrogenous wastes are absorbed by passive transport. In collecting tubules some water is absorbed. (iii) Selective secretion: The metabolic waste products like ammonia, hippuric acid, creatinine, H+ ions etc., present in the blood diffuses into DCT. This process is called selective secretion. It changes the complete composition of glomerular filtrate which is now called urine.","19.2 URINE FORMATION Urine formation involves three main processes namely, glomerular filtration, reabsorption and secretion, that takes place in different parts of the nephron. The first step in urine formation is the filtration of blood, which is carried out by the glomerulus and is called glomerular filtration. On an average, 1100-1200 ml of blood is filtered by the kidneys per minute which constitute roughly 1/5th of the blood pumped out by each ventricle of the heart in a minute. The glomerular capillary blood pressure causes filtration of blood through 3 layers, i.e., the endothelium of glomerular blood vessels, the epithelium of Bowman‚Äôs capsule and a basement membrane between these two layers. The epithelial cells of Bowman‚Äôs capsule called podocytes are arranged in an intricate manner so as to leave some minute spaces called filtration slits or slit pores. Blood is filtered so finely through these membranes, that almost all the constituents of the plasma except the proteins pass onto the lumen of the Bowman‚Äôs capsule. Therefore, it is considered as a process of ultra filtration.
 minute (GFR). JGA, a specialised portion of the nephrons, plays a significant role in the regulation of GFR. Nearly 99 per cent reabsorption of the filtrate takes place through different parts of the nephrons. PCT is the major site of reabsorption and selective secretion. HL primarily helps to maintain osmolar gradient (300 mOsmolL‚Äì1 -1200 mOsmolL‚Äì1) within the kidney interstitium. DCT and collecting duct allow extensive reabsorption of water and certain electrolytes, which help in osmoregulation: H+, K+ and NH3 could be secreted into the filtrate by the tubules to maintain the ionic balance and pH of body fluids. A counter current mechanism operates between the two limbs of the loop of Henle and those of vasa recta (capillary parallel to Henle‚Äôs loop). The filtrate gets concentrated as it moves down the descending limb but is diluted by the ascending limb. Electrolytes and urea are retained in the interstitium by this arrangement. DCT and collecting duct concentrate the filtrate about four times, i.e., from 300 mOsmolL‚Äì1 to 1200 mOsmolL‚Äì1, an excellent mechanism of conservation of water. Urine is stored in the urinary bladder till a voluntary signal from CNS carries out its release through urethra, i.e., micturition. Skin, lungs and liver also assist in excretion.

Define growth. Explain the phases of growth.,"Growth is defined as 'a permanent or irreversible increase in dry weight, mass or volume of a cell, organ or organism‚Äô. Plant growth takes place in three steps or phases cell division (meristematic), cell elongation and cell maturation. (i) Cell division (Meristematic) phase: (i) It is also called formative phase. (ii) New cells are produced by mitotic divisions of the pre-existing cells. (iii) The meristematic cells have thin cellulose walls with abundant plasmodesmetal connections, dense protoplasm and conspicuous nuclei. (iv) In higher plants, cell division occurs in meristems or growing points. (v) As the formation of new cells requires intense biosynthetic activity, the rate of respiration in the cells of formation phase is very high. (ii) Cell enlargement phase: (i) This phase lies just behind the growing points and is mainly responsible for growth of plant parts. (ii) The newly formed cells, produced in formative phase ergo enlargement. (iii) The enlarging cell also develops a central vacuole. Rate of respiration is but less than that of the cells in the formative phase. (iv) Thus, this phase is characterised by cell enlargement, new cell wall deposition and increased vacuolation. (iii) Cell maturation phase: (i) This phase occurs just behind the phase of elongation. (ii) The enlarged cells develop into particular type of cells by undergoing structural and physiological differentiation. (iii) Hence, at this phase all the diverse tissue types observed in root or stem viz., epidermis, cortex, vascular tissues etc., and cell are differentiated.","SUMMARY Growth is one of the most conspicuous events in any living organism. It is an irreversible increase expressed in parameters such as size, area, length, height, volume, cell number etc. It conspicuously involves increased protoplasmic material. In plants, meristems are the sites of growth. Root and shoot apical meristems sometimes alongwith intercalary meristem, contribute to the elongation growth of plant axes. Growth is indeterminate in higher plants. Following cell division in root and shoot apical meristem cells, the growth could be arithmetic or geometrical. Growth may not be and generally is not sustained at a high rate throughout the life of cell/tissue/organ/organism. One can define three principle phases of growth ‚Äì the lag, the log and the senescent phase. When a cell loses the capacity to divide, it leads to differentiation. Differentiation results in development of structures that is commensurate with the function the cells finally has to perform. General principles for differentiation for cell, tissues and organs are similar. A differentiated cell may dedifferentiate and then redifferentiate. Since differentiation in plants is open, the development could also be flexible, i.e., the development is the sum of growth and differentiation. Plant exhibit plasticity in development. Plant growth and development are under the control of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intercellular intrinsic factors are the chemical substances, called plant growth regulators (PGR). There are diverse groups of PGRs in plants, principally belonging to five groups: auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid and ethylene. These PGRs are synthesised in various parts of the plant; they control different differentiation and developmental events. Any PGR has diverse physiological effects on plants. Diverse PGRs also manifest similar effects. PGRs may act synergistically or antagonistically. Plant growth and development is also affected by light, temperature, nutrition, oxygen status, gravity and such external factors. Flowering in some plants is induced only when exposed to certain duration of photoperiod. Depending on the nature of photoperiod requirements, the plants are called short day plants, long day plants and day-neutral plants. Certain plants also need to be exposed to low temperature so as to hasten flowering later in life. This treatement is known as vernalisation.
 "
What is growth rate? How will you measure the rate of growth ?,"(i) Growth rate refers to the expression of increased growth per unit time. (ii) It can be arithmetic or geometric increase. (iii) In arithmetic growth, following mitotic cell division only one daughter cell continues to divide while the other differentiates and mature. (iv) The simplest expression of arithmetic growth is exemplified by a root elongating at a constant rate. (v) On plotting length of the organ at different times a linear curve is obtained. It is expressed as: Lt = L 0 + rt  Here,  Lt = Length at time ‚Äòt‚Äô L0 = Length at time Zero‚Äô r = growth rate per unit time.  (vi) In geometrical growth, the initial growth is slow (lag phase) and rapidly at an exponential rate (log or exponential phase). (vii) In this growth, both the progeny cells formed by mitotic cell division retain the ability to divide and continue to do so. (viii) However, with limited nutrient supply, the growth slows down (stationary phase). (ix) If we plot a parameter of growth against time, we get a typical S-shaped or sigmoid curve. (x) The exponential growth can be expressed as:  W 1 = W0 ùëí ùëüùë° Here, W 1 = final size (Weight, height, number etc.) W 0 = initial size r = growth rate t = time of growth ùëí = base of natural logarithms.","The growth rate shows an increase that may be arithmetic or geometrical (Figure 15.4). In arithmetic growth, following mitotic cell division, only one daughter cell continues to divide while the other differentiates and matures. The simplest expression of arithmetic growth is exemplified by a root elongating at a constant rate. Look at Figure 15.5. On plotting the length of the organ against time, a linear curve is obtained. Mathematically, it is expressed as Lt = L0 + rt Lt = length at time ‚Äòt‚Äô L0 = length at time ‚Äòzero‚Äô = growth rate / elongation per unit time.

Discuss the role of growth regulators in agriculture.,"Role of growth regulators in agriculture: (i) Parthenocarpy: The knowledge of the fact that application of auxins and gibberellins on unpollinated flowers results in the production of seedless fruits has been a great horticultural importance. It has been of great significance in such fruits where the number of seeds is very high and the seeds are of light food value (e.g., tomato, brinjal, guava, papaya, watermelon, orange) or the seeds are large in size (e.g., Litchi and Mango). (ii) Flower thinning: This problem refers to fall of unpollinated or unfertilized flowers from certain fruit trees e.g., in pineapple and litchi. This problem has been solved to a great extent by spraying the plants with 2, 4-D and Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA) both of which are synthetic auxins. (iii) Fruit ripening: Ethylene plays an important role in ripening of various fruits like oranges, lemons, grapes, banana etc. (iv) Root inducing or Root induction: NAA and Indole Butyric Acid (IBA) are very important in inducing roots on stem cuttings. Many plants are known which propagate by their stem cuttings such as Bougainvillea, roses, grapes, apples, coleus etc. (v) Seed germination: Seeds having long periods of dormancy can be made to germinate early by the application of auxins ","15.4.3 Physiological Effects of Plant Growth Regulators 15.4.3.1 Auxins Auxins (from Greek ‚Äòauxein‚Äô : to grow) was first isolated from human urine. The term ‚Äòauxin‚Äô is applied to the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and to other natural and synthetic compounds having certain growth regulating properties. They are generally produced by the growing apices of the stems and roots, from where they migrate to the regions of their action. Auxins like IAA and indole butyric acid (IBA) have been isolated from plants. NAA (naphthalene acetic acid) and 2, 4-D (2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic) are synthetic auxins. All these auxins have been used extensively in agricultural and horticultural practices. They help to initiate rooting in stem cuttings, an application widely used for plant propagation. Auxins promote flowering e.g. in pineapples. They help to prevent fruit and leaf drop at early stages but promote the abscission of older mature leaves and fruits. In most higher plants, the growing apical bud inhibits the growth of the lateral (axillary) buds, a phenomenon called apical dominance. Removal of shoot tips (decapitation) usually results in the growth of lateral buds (Figure 15.11). It is widely applied in tea plantations, hedge-making. Can you explain why?
 "
Mention elaborately the functions of Auxins.,"Functions of Auxins: (i) Cell enlargement: Auxins promote elongation and growth of stems and roots enlargement of many fruits by stimulating cell enlargement. The auxins cause cell enlargement by solubilization of carbohydrates, loosening of microfibrils synthesis of more wall materials, increased membrane permeability and respiration. (ii) Cell division in cambium: Auxin is responsible for initiation and promotion of cell division in cambium. The reactivation of cambium in the growing season is apparently triggered by IAA moving from the developing shoot buds. (iii) Cell division and tissue culture: In tissue culture auxins initiate and promote cell division, and result in the formation of callus. (iv) Root growth and root initiation: Auxins promote root growth only at extremely low concentration. At higher concentration, auxin is suitable for shoot elongation.","15.4.3 Physiological Effects of Plant Growth Regulators 15.4.3.1 Auxins Auxins (from Greek ‚Äòauxein‚Äô : to grow) was first isolated from human urine.

 Auxins also induce parthenocarpy, e.g., in tomatoes. They are widely used as herbicides. 2, 4-D, widely used to kill dicotyledonous weeds, does not affect mature monocotyledonous plants. It is used to prepare weed-free lawns by gardeners. Auxin also controls xylem differentiation and helps in cell division. 15.4.3.2
 Gibberellins
 Gibberellins are another kind of promotory PGR. There are more than 100 gibberellins (a) (b) reported from widely different organisms such as fungi and higher plants. They are denoted Figure 15.11 Apical dominance in plants : as GA 1, GA 2, GA 3 and so on. However, (a) A plant with apical bud intact (b) A plant with apical bud removed Gibberellic acid (GA3) was one of the first Note the growth of lateral buds into gibberellins to be discovered and remains the branches after decapitation. most intensively studied form. All GAs are acidic. They produce a wide range of physiological responses in the plants. Their ability to cause an increase in length of axis is used to increase the length of grapes stalks. Gibberellins, cause fruits like apple to elongate and improve its shape. They also delay senescence. Thus, the fruits can be left on the tree longer so as to extend the market period. GA3 is used to speed up the malting process in brewing industry. Sugarcane stores carbohydrate as sugar in their stems. Spraying sugarcane crop with gibberellins increases the length of the stem, thus increasing the yield by as much as 20 tonnes per acre. Spraying juvenile conifers with GAs hastens the maturity period, thus leading to early seed production. Gibberellins also promotes bolting (internode elongation just prior to flowering) in beet, cabbages and many plants with rosette habit. 15.4.3.3 Cytokinins Cytokinins have specific effects on cytokinesis, and were discovered as kinetin (a modified form of adenine, a purine) from the autoclaved herring sperm DNA. Kinetin does not occur naturally in plants. Search for natural substances with cytokinin-like activities led to the isolation of zeatin from corn-kernels and coconut milk. Since the discovery of zeatin, several naturally occurring cytokinins, and some synthetic compounds with cell division promoting activity, have been identified. Natural cytokinins are synthesised in regions where rapid cell division occurs, for example, root apices, developing shoot buds, young fruits etc. It helps to produce new

Give the natural and artificial overcoming of seed dormancy.,"Natural overcoming of seed dormancy: (i) Weakening of tough and impermeable seed coats by microbial action. (ii) Rupturing or weakening of seed coats by mechanical abrasions. (iii) Action of digestive enzymes present in alimentary canals of birds and other animals which happen to feed on their fruits. (iv) Leaching of inhibitors present in the seed coat. (v) Inactivation or oxidation of inhibitors by heat, cold and light. Artificial overcoming of seed dormancy: (i) Rupturing of seed coats or scarification by abrasion through machine threshing, filing, chipping, vigorous shaking, etc. (ii) Treatment with hot water or fat solvents for dissolution of surface inhibitors, waxes, etc. (iii) Treatment with concentrated sulphuric acid for a short period followed by thorough washing to remove all traces of the mineral acid. (iv) Stratification or subjecting the moist seeds in the presence of oxygen to periods of low or high temperature. (v) Counteracting the effect of growth inhibitors by soaking the seeds in potassium nitrate, ethylene chlorohydrin, thiourea, gibberellins, etc. Exposure to high concentration of oxygen has similar effect. ","15.6 VERNALISATION There are plants for which flowering is either quantitatively or qualitatively dependent on exposure to low temperature. This phenomenon is termed vernalisation. It prevents precocious reproductive development late in the growing season, and enables the plant to have sufficient time to reach maturity. Vernalisation refers specially to the promotion of flowering by a period of low temperature. Some important food plants, wheat, barley, rye have two kinds of varieties: winter and spring varieties. The ‚Äòspring‚Äô variety are normally planted in the spring and come to flower and produce grain before the end of the growing season. Winter varieties, however, if planted in spring would normally fail to flower or produce mature grain within a span of a flowering season. Hence, they are planted in autumn. They germinate, and over winter come out as small seedlings, resume growth in the spring, and are harvested usually around mid-summer. Another example of vernalisation is seen in biennial plants. Biennials are monocarpic plants that normally flower and die in the second season. Sugarbeet, cabbages, carrots are some of the common biennials. Subjecting the growing of a biennial plant to a cold treatment stimulates a subsequent photoperiodic flowering response.
 15.7 SEED DORMANCY There are certain seeds which fail to germinate even when external conditions are favourable. Such seeds are understood to be undergoing a period of dormancy which is controlled not by external environment but are under endogenous control or conditions within the seed itself. Impermeable and hard seed coat; presence of chemical inhibitors such as abscissic acids, phenolic acids, para-ascorbic acid; and immature
 embryos are some of the reasons which causes seed dormancy. This dormancy however can be overcome through natural means and various other man-made measures. For example, the seed coat barrier in some seeds can be broken by mechanical abrasions using knives, sandpaper, etc. or vigorous shaking. In nature, these abrasions are caused by microbial action, and passage through digestive tract of animals. Effect of inhibitory substances can be removed by subjecting the seeds to chilling conditions or by application of certain chemicals like gibberellic acid and nitrates. Changing the environmental conditions, such as light and temperature are other methods to overcome seed dormancy.
 "
What is seed dormancy? How many types of dormancy are there ?,"Seed dormancy or rest is the internal or innate inhibition of germination of otherwise normal or viable seed even when present under most favourable conditions required for its germination. Dormancy is of several types. The important ones are as follows: (i) Immature embryo: The embryo is not fully developed at the time of seed shedding. The period of seed dormancy corresponds to the period required by the embryo for its complete development. e.g. Ginkgo biloba. (ii) After ripening: After shedding, the seeds of barley, wheat require an interval of ripening before they attain the power of germination. This period is needed to produce the necessary growth hormones. (iii) Impermeability of seed coats: The seed coats are impermeable to water, gases or chemical e.g., Chenopodium, Apple, Xanthium respectively. (iv) Tough seed coats: The seed coats are hard and growth of provide mechanical resistance to the embryo.","15.6 VERNALISATION There are plants for which flowering is either quantitatively or qualitatively dependent on exposure to low temperature.

What are the uses of Ethylene and Abscissic acid?,"Uses of Ethylene: (i) Ethylene is used for colour development and ripening of certain fleshy fruits. (ii) Application of ethephon in cucumber increases the number of female flowers and hen fruits (iii) The sprouting of storage organs such as rhizomes, corms, tubers can be enhanced by exposing them to ethylene. Uses of Abscissic acid: (i) ABA can be used as anti-transpirant. Application of minute quantity of ABA to leaves reduces transpiration to a great extent through partial closure of stomata. (ii) Abscissic acid can be used to promote rooting in many stem cuttings. (iii) The dormancy of buds, seeds and storage organs can be prolonged by the application of ABA.","leaves, chloroplasts in leaves, lateral shoot growth and adventitious shoot formation. Cytokinins help overcome the apical dominance. They promote nutrient mobilisation which helps in the delay of leaf senescence. 15.4.3.4 Ethylene Ethylene is a simple gaseous PGR. It is synthesised in large amounts by tissues undergoing senescence and ripening fruits. Influences of ethylene on plants include horizontal growth of seedlings, swelling of the axis and apical hook formation in dicot seedlings. Ethylene promotes senescence and abscission of plant organs especially of leaves and flowers. Ethylene is highly effective in fruit ripening. It enhances the respiration rate during ripening of the fruits. This rise in rate of respiration is called respiratory climactic. Ethylene breaks seed and bud dormancy, initiates germination in peanut seeds, sprouting of potato tubers. Ethylene promotes rapid internode/petiole elongation in deep water rice plants. It helps leaves/ upper parts of the shoot to remain above water. Ethylene also promotes root growth and root hair formation, thus helping the plants to increase their absorption surface. Ethylene is used to initiate flowering and for synchronising fruit-set in pineapples. It also induces flowering in mango. Since ethylene regulates so many physiological processes, it is one of the most widely used PGR in agriculture. The most widely used compound as source of ethylene is ethephon. Ethephon in an aqueous solution is readily absorbed and transported within the plant and releases ethylene slowly. Ethephon hastens fruit ripening in tomatoes and apples and accelerates abscission in flowers and fruits (thinning of cotton, cherry, walnut). It promotes female flowers in cucumbers thereby increasing the yield. 15.4.3.5 Abscisic acid As mentioned earlier, abscisic acid (ABA) was discovered for its role in regulating abscission and dormancy. But like other PGRs, it also has other wide ranging effects on plant growth and development. It acts as a general plant growth inhibitor and an inhibitor of plant metabolism. ABA inhibits seed germination. ABA stimulates the closure of stomata and increases the tolerance of plants to various kinds of stresses. Therefore, it is also called the stress hormone. ABA plays an important role in seed development, maturation and dormancy. By inducing dormancy, ABA helps seeds to withstand desiccation and other factors unfavourable for growth. In most situations, ABA acts as an antagonist to GAs. We may summarise that for any and every phase of growth, differentiation and development of plants, one or the other PGR has some role to play. Such roles could be complimentary or antagonistic. These could be individualistic or synergistic.

Mention the examples which prove that phytohormones act synergistically or antagonistically.,"Phytochrome: (i) It is the pigment which is responsible for flowering. (ii) It makes the plant sensitive to light effect. (iii) It is known as light absorbing pigment and is responsible for photosensitiveness of plants. (iv) It participates in flowering. In long day plants, the light interruption of dark period does not prevent (v) If the light is by infra-red, the flowering gets promoted. (vi) Phytochrome occurs in two forms-one red absorbing (PR) and the other far red absorbing (P FR). (vii) Both the forms are photo-chemically interconvertible. (viii) The red absorbing form after absorbing the red light is converted into far red form. (ix) They absorbs the infra-red light and is converted back into red absorbing form of pigment.  (x) Flowering is considered a phytochrome mediated process. (xi) Photoperiodism controls flowering in plants. Short-day plants like Xanthium, Chrysanthemum require a relatively short day high period and a continuous dark period of about 14-16 hours for flowering. (xii) Dark period is more important to induce flowering than the light period. Flowering can be induced in short day plants by red light treatment followed by far red light treatment.  ","known that not only the duration of light period but that the duration of dark period is also of equal importance. Hence, it can be said that flowering in certain plants depends not only on a combination of light and dark exposures but also their relative durations. This response of plants to periods of day/night is termed photoperiodism. It is also interesting to note that while shoot apices modify themselves into flowering apices prior to flowering, they (i.e., shoot apices of plants) by themselves cannot percieve photoperiods. The site of perception of light/dark duration are the leaves. It has been hypothesised that there is a hormonal substance(s) that is responsible for flowering. This hormonal substance migrates from leaves to shoot apices for inducing flowering only when the plants are exposed to the necessary inductive photoperiod.

What is root? Briefly explain the regions or parts present in a typical root.,"Root : The root is non-green, cylindrical descending part of the plant that normally grows downwards into the soil. A typical root possesses five parts or regions: (i) Root Cap: It is a thimble shaped or cap like, structure present at the tip of the root. It protects the tender apex of the root as it makes its way through the soil. (ii) Growing or meristematic zone : It lies above the root cap. The cells of this zone divide actively and add new cells to root and root cap. (iii) Zone of Elongation: It lies behind the meristematic zone. The cells of this region are newly formed cells, which lose the power of division. These also possess the power of absorption of water from the soil. (iv) Zone of Root hair : It lies above the region of elongation and bears a clusters of very fine tubular outgrowths called root hairs. This zone is also called the zone of differentiation because different types of primary tissues mature in this region. (v) Zone of Maturation : This region forms the major part of the root and no change occur in this region. It forms the permanent zone of the root and also gives out lateral roots.","Regions of the Root
 The root is covered at the apex by a thimble-like structure called the root cap (Figure 5.3). It protects the tender apex of the root as it makes its way through the soil. A few millimetres above the root cap is the region of meristematic activity. The cells of this region are very small, thin-walled and with dense protoplasm. They divide repeatedly. The cells proximal to this region undergo rapid elongation and enlargement and are responsible for the growth of the root in length. This region is called the region of elongation. The cells of the elongation zone gradually differentiate and mature. Hence, this zone, proximal to region of elongation, is called the region of maturation. From this region some of the epidermal cells form very fine and delicate, thread-like structures called root hairs. These root hairs absorb water and minerals from the soil.

Describe with examples modifications of adventitious roots.,"Modifications of Adventitious Roots: (i) Tuberous: It is swollen root and shapeless occurring singly. e.g., Sweet potato. (ii) Fasciculated: Several tuberous roots arise from the same place in a cluster. e.g, Dahlia, Asparagus Ruellia. (ii) Beaded roots: These roots have swollen parts at frequent intervals. eg., Portulaca, Mormordica charantia and vitis. (iv) Prop roots: These are pillar like roots, hanging vertically downward from the aerial branch of the plants, e.g., Banyan tree. (v) Stilt roots : The roots are short which grow obliquely from near the base of the main stem and they provide anchorage and support to the stem. e.g., sugarcane, maize, Sorghum, screwpine.","Adventitious roots

Define buds. What are the modification of buds ?,"Buds: A bud is a compact under developed shoot having a growing point, surrounded by closely placed immature leaves.  Modifications of buds: (i) Bulbils: They are specialised buds, which become fleshy due to storage of food and take part in vegetative reproduction. Bulbils may be axillary on the leaf, in place of flower on the floral axis. (ii) Tendrillar buds: Buds in some plants are modified into long threads, called tendrils. They help the plant in climbing over some support. e.g., Cucurbita, Passiflora. (iii) Bud thorns: In some plants, buds are modified into thorns to reduce transpiration and to act as organs of defence against grazing, e.g., Duranta.","Axillary bud modified into tendril
 "
What is venation? Explain its types.,"Venation: The arrangement of veins and veinlets in the lamina of a leaf is called venation. The veins are not only the conducting channels for water, minerals and organic food, they also provide firmness to the lamina and keep it expanded, They give rise to lateral veins, which traverse the entire lamina. Venation is of three types: Reticulate and parallel. (i) Reticulate Venation: When the veinlets form a network, the venation is termed as reticulate venation. E.g., leaves of dicot plants. (ii) Parallel Venation: When the veins arising from mid rib or main veins, run parallel to each other towards the margin or the apex of the lamina, venation is termed as parallel venation. Present in the leaves of monocot plants. Parallel venation is of two sub-types: (i) Pinnate or Unicostate parallel venation: The lamina has a single prominent vein or midrib running from the base to the apex of lamina. e.g., Banana, Canna, etc. (ii) Palmate or multicostate parallel venation: The lamina has several principal veins arising from the base and running towards the apex or margin of the lamina.","Venation
 The arrangement of veins and the veinlets in the lamina of leaf is termed as venation. When the veinlets form a network, the venation is termed as reticulate (Figure 5.7 b). When the veins run parallel to each other within a lamina, the venation is termed as parallel (Figure 5.7 c). Leaves of dicotyledonous plants generally possess reticulate venation, while parallel venation is the characteristic of most monocotyledons.

 Figure 5.2 Different types of roots : (a) Tap (b) Fibrous (c) Adventitious
 Roots in some plants change their shape and structure and become modified to perform functions other than absorption and conduction of water and minerals. They are modified for support, storage of food and respiration (Figure 5.4 and 5.5). Tap roots of carrot, turnip and adventitious roots of sweet potato, get swollen and store food. Can you give some more such examples? Have you ever wondered what those hanging structures that support a banyan tree are? These are called prop roots. Similarly, the stems of maize and sugarcane have supporting roots coming out of the lower nodes of the stem. These are called stilt roots. In some plants such as Rhizophora growing in swampy areas, many roots come out of the ground and grow vertically upwards. Such roots, called pneumatophores, help to get oxygen for respiration (Figure 5.5b).

What is a floral diagram ? What special features does a floral diagram inform?,"A floral diagram is ""the diagrammatic representation of the ground part of a flower illustrating the number, arrangement and inter-relationship of various floral parts. The special features, which a floral diagram provides, are: (i) Symmetry of the flower. (ii) Sex of the flower. (iii) Bracts present or absent, bracteoles present or absent ; position of bracts and bracteoles in relation to other floral parts; (iv) Number of floral cyclic. (v) Number of floral parts.

(x) Position of floral parts in relation with the mother axis.","Various morphological features are used to describe a flowering plant. The description has to be brief, in a simple and scientific language and presented in a proper sequence. The plant is described beginning with its habit, vegetative characters ‚Äì roots, stem and leaves and then floral characters inflorescence and flower parts. After describing various parts of plant, a floral diagram and a floral formula are presented. The floral formula is represented by some symbols. In the floral formula, Br stands for bracteate K stands for calyx , C for corolla, P for perianth, A for androecium and G for Gynoecium, G for superior ovary and G for inferior ovary, for male, for female, for bisexual plants, ‚äï for actinomorphic and for zygomorphic nature of flower. Fusion is indicated by enclosing the figure within bracket and adhesion by a line drawn above the symbols of the floral parts. A floral diagram provides information about the number of parts of a flower, their arrangement and the relation they have with one another (Figure 5.20). The position of the mother axis with respect to the flower is represented by a dot on the top of the floral diagram. Calyx, corolla, androecium and gynoecium are drawn in successive whorls, calyx being the outermost and the gynoecium being in the centre. Floral formula also shows cohesion and adhesion within parts of whorls and between whorls. The floral diagram and floral formula in Figure 5.20 represents the mustard plant (Family: Brassicaceae).

What do you understand by aestivation ? How many types of aestivation are found ?,"Aestivation: The arrangement of sepals or petals with respect to one another in floral bud is called ‚Äòaestivation‚Äô Types of aestivation : (i) Valvate : The sepals or petals are arranged in a whorl which just touch one another at the margin. They do not overlap. e.g., Acacia, Calotropis. (ii) Twisted : In this type of aestivation, one margin of a sepal or petal overlaps the next sepal or petal, and next margin is overlapped by the proceeding one resulting in a twisted appearance. Overlapping is always in one direction. E.g. China rose (petals), Cotton and lady's finger. (iii) Imbricate: In this type of aestivation, the margins of sepals or petals overlap one another but not in any definite direction. e.g., Cassia and gulmohur. (iv) Vexillary: In this type of aestivation, the posterior petal is the largest and covers almost the two lateral petals, and the latter in their tum, nearly overlap the two anterior or smallest petals E.g., pea.","Each flower normally has four floral whorls, viz., calyx, corolla, androecium and gynoecium (Figure 5.14). 5.5.1.1
 Calyx
 The calyx is the outermost whorl of the flower and the members are called sepals. Generally, sepals are green, leaf like and protect the flower in the bud stage. The calyx may be gamosepalous (sepals united) or polysepalous (sepals free). 5.5.1.2
 gamopetalous (petals united) or polypetalous (petals free). The shape and colour of corolla vary greatly in plants. Corolla may be tubular, bellshaped, funnel-shaped or wheel-shaped. Aestivation: The mode of arrangement of sepals or petals in floral bud with respect to the other members of the same whorl is known as aestivation. The main types of aestivation are valvate, twisted, imbricate and vexillary (Figure 5.15). When sepals or petals in a whorl just touch one another at the margin, without overlapping, as in Calotropis, it is said to be valvate. If one margin of the appendage overlaps that of the next one and so on as in china rose, lady‚Äôs finger and cotton, it is called twisted. If the margins of sepals or petals overlap one another but not in any particular direction as in Cassia and gulmohur, the aestivation is called imbricate. In pea and bean flowers, there are five petals, the largest (standard) overlaps the two lateral petals (wings) which in turn overlap the two smallest anterior petals (keel); this type of aestivation is known as vexillary or papilionaceous.

Give the structure of the maize grain.,"(i) The maize grain is an endospermic seed (ii) The internal structure of seed or grain is like monocotyledonous seed. (iii) On the outside, there is a single covering representing fused pericarp or testa. (iv) Inside, the grain is divided into two unequal portions: the endosperm and the embryo. (v) The endosperm is the upper half of the grain which is laden with starch, but its outer layer next to the grain coat, contains abundant protein. It is called aleurone layer. (vi) The lower half of the grain is occupied by the embryo. (vii) The embryo has single cotyledon attached to embryonal axis, called scutellum. (viii) The portion of embryonal axis below the cotyledon is the radicle and the upper end of embryonal a is the plumule, surrounded by a protective sheath called coleoptile. ","Structure of Monocotyledonous Seed
 Generally, monocotyledonous seeds are endospermic but some as in orchids are non-endospermic. In the seeds of cereals such as maize the seed coat is membranous and generally fused with the fruit wall. The endosperm is bulky and stores food. The outer covering of endosperm separates the embryo by a proteinous layer called aleurone layer. The embryo is small and situated in a groove at one end of the endosperm. It consists of one large and shield shaped cotyledon known as scutellum and a short axis with a plumule and a radicle. The plumule and radicle are enclosed in sheaths which are called coleoptile and coleorhiza respectively (Figure 5.19).

Write an account of various types of fruits.,"Fruit : The ripened and matured ovary after fertilization is called 'fruit‚Äô. (i) In some plants, the ovary and other floral parts may turn into fruit without fertilization. The fruits without fertilization are called ‚ÄòParthenocarpic fruit‚Äô or ‚ÄòSeedless fruit‚Äô. E.g., Banana. (ii) True and False fruits : The fruits which are developed from the fertilized ovary are called true fruits. E.g., Pea, Maize, Wheat, etc. (iii) The fruits developed from other non-essential parts of the flower (such as sepals, petals, thalamus etc.) are called 'false fruit‚Äô or ‚ÄòPseudocarpic fruits‚Äô E.g., apple (thalamus is edible). ","5.6 THE FRUIT The fruit is a characteristic feature of the flowering plants. It is a mature or ripened ovary, developed after fertilisation. If a fruit is formed without fertilisation of the ovary, it is called a parthenocarpic fruit. Generally, the fruit consists of a wall or pericarp and seeds. The pericarp may be dry or fleshy. When pericarp is thick and fleshy, it is differentiated into the outer epicarp, the middle mesocarp and the inner endocarp.

 Structure of Monocotyledonous Seed
 Generally, monocotyledonous seeds are endospermic but some as in orchids are non-endospermic. In the seeds of cereals such as maize the seed coat is membranous and generally fused with the fruit wall. The endosperm is bulky and stores food. The outer covering of endosperm separates the embryo by a proteinous layer called aleurone layer. The embryo is small and situated in a groove at one end of the endosperm. It consists of one large and shield shaped cotyledon known as scutellum and a short axis with a plumule and a radicle. The plumule and radicle are enclosed in sheaths which are called coleoptile and coleorhiza respectively (Figure 5.19).

Write any four important functions of each : (i) Epithelial tissue (ii) Connective tissue (iii) Muscular tissue.,"Labelled diagram of alimentary canal of cockroach : Refer to SAQ-IIQ 2. Functions : Crop : The oesophagus dilates to form a large thin walled pear shaped crop. The crop is very large part of the alimentary canal of the cockroach where food is stored. It opens into gizzard. Gizzard : It is a thick walled, rounded structure whose walls are muscular and greatly folded. It has six muscular folds which are covered by chitinous conical plates, the teeth, used for grinding the food. Its wall consists of strong circular muscles which are needed by the gizzard for grinding.","The alimentary canal present in the body cavity Salivary is divided into three regions: foregut, midgut reservoir and hindgut (Figure 7.16). The mouth opens Oesophagus into a short tubular pharynx, leading to a narrow tubular passage called oesophagus. Crop This in turn opens into a sac like structure called crop used for storing of food.

Describe the external morphology of cockroach.,"Body of cockroach is elongated and dorsoventrally flattened. It is red brown in colour. Males are larger than females. Body is covered by brown chitinous exoskeleton. Cockroach is nocturnal and the body is segmented. It is divided into three distinct parts: (i) Head: The head is triangular. It lies anteriorly at right angles to the longitudinal body axis. Head is formed by the fusion of six segments. The head is flexible and is covered by head capsule, The head bears two sessile compound eyes, one on each of its side. Two thread-like long antennae arise from membranous sockets. They are very sensitive, The anterior end of head bears mouth. Mouth part comprises labrum, a pair of mandibles, a pair of maxilla and labium. There is a medium lobe, hypopharynx which acts like tongue. (ii) Thorax: It consists of 3 segments: (i) Prothorax, (ii) mesothorax, (iii) metathorax. Head is connected with the thorax by a short extension of the prothorax called the neck. Large sclerites covers the prothorax and shields the mesothorax Each thoracic segment bears two walking legs, each leg has 5 segments: (1) coxa, (ii) trochanter, (iii) femur, (iv) tibia, (v) tarsus. The first and second pairs of wings arises from mesothorax and metathorax respectively. The fore wings are called tegmina. Wings are used for flight.  (iii) Abdomen: In both mnale and female it consists of 10 segments. The seventh sternum is boat-shaped in females and together with eighth and ninth sterna makes a broad genital pouch. The tenth segment bears two jointed filamentous structures which are known as anal cerci. The 9th segment bears a pair of short, thread-like style which lies ventral to anal cirri. The anal styles are not found in female cockroach.  ","7.4 COCKROACH Cockroaches are brown or black bodied animals that are included in class Insecta of Phylum Arthropoda. Bright yellow, red and green coloured cockroaches have also been reported in tropical regions. Their size ranges from ¬º inches to 3 inches (0.6-7.6 cm) and have long antenna, legs and flat extension of the upper body wall that conceals head. They are nocturnal omnivores that live in damp places throughout the world. They have become residents of human homes and thus are serious pests and vectors of several diseases.

Define taxonomy. Briefly explain the processes in Taxonomy.,"The process of classification of all living organisms on the basis of their characteristics is called taxonomy. The processes carried out in taxonomy are as follows: (i) The organism has to be described for its all morphological, anatomical, physiological and behavioural properties. It is called as characterisation. (ii) On the basis of its characters, it is decided whether it is similar or different to any known group of taxa. It is called identification. (iii) Based on similar characteristics, it is then placed in a known taxa. It is called classification. (iv) When the organism is placed in the right taxa, the last step is to determine its name. This is called as nomenclature.","SUMMARY The living world is rich in variety. Millions of plants and animals have been identified and described but a large number still remains unknown. The very range of organisms in terms of size, colour, habitat, physiological and morphological features make us seek the defining characteristics of living organisms. In order to facilitate the study of kinds and diversity of organisms, biologists have evolved certain rules and principles for identification, nomenclature and classification of organisms. The branch of knowledge dealing with these aspects is referred to as taxonomy. The taxonomic studies of various species of plants and animals are useful in agriculture, forestry, industry and in general for knowing our bio-resources and their diversity. The basics of taxonomy like identification, naming and classification of organisms are universally evolved under international codes. Based on the resemblances and distinct differences, each organism is identified and assigned a correct scientific/biological name comprising two words as per the binomial system of nomenclature. An organism represents/occupies a place or position in the system of classification. There are many categories/ranks and are generally referred to as taxonomic categories or taxa. All the categories constitute a taxonomic hierarchy. Taxonomists have developed a variety of taxonomic aids to facilitate identification, naming and classification of organisms. These studies are carried out from the actual specimens which are collected from the field and preserved as referrals in the form of herbaria, museums and in botanical gardens and zoological parks. It requires special techniques for collection and preservation of specimens in herbaria and museums. Live specimens, on the other hand, of plants and animals, are found in botanical gardens or in zoological parks. Taxonomists also prepare and disseminate information through manuals and monographs for further taxonomic studies. Taxonomic keys are tools that help in identification based on characteristics.
 "
Why biological classification is useful?,Biological classification is very useful as it serves the following purposes: (i) It makes the identification of organisms very clear and easy. (ii) The study of these organisms is convenient. (iii) The study of few representatives from each group enables us to have a broad idea of the life of the whole group. (iv) It helps to interpret the poor visible structure of the fossil organisms. (v) It helps to understand the evolutionary trends in various groups of organisms.,"BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION
 "
What are the guidelines for naming of organisms?,"(i) The earlier botanists and zoologists who wanted to study plants and animals faced great difficulty in their systematic study, because it is not possible for a person to know and remember about every plant or an animal individually. Moreover, different species of plants and animals were known by different names in different parts of the world. (ii) These two things created great difficulties. In order to overcome these difficulties all the earlier biologists tried to classify them into various groups, though in the beginning the attempts to classify them were not on scientific lines. But all were same on the fact that classification and proper study of organisms were not possible. To overcome this all the earlier biologists tried to classify living things.","Since the dawn of civilisation, there have been many attempts to classify living organisms. It was done instinctively not using criteria that were scientific but borne out of a need to use organisms for our own use ‚Äì for food, shelter and clothing. Aristotle was the earliest to attempt a more scientific basis for classification. He used simple morphological characters to classify plants into trees, shrubs and herbs. He also divided animals into two groups, those which had red blood and those that did not. In Linnaeus' time a Two Kingdom system of classification with Plantae and Animalia kingdoms was developed that included all plants and animals respectively. This system did not distinguish between the eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organisms and photosynthetic (green algae) and non-photosynthetic (fungi) organisms. Classification of organisms into plants and animals was easily done and was easy to understand, but, a large number of organisms did not fall into either category. Hence the two kingdom classification used for a long time was found inadequate. Besides, gross morphology a need was also felt for including other characteristics like cell structure, nature of wall, mode of nutrition, habitat, methods of reproduction, evolutionary relationships, etc. Classification systems for the living organisms have hence, undergone several changes over the time. Though plant and animal kingdoms have been a constant under all different systems, the understanding of what groups/organisms be included under these kingdoms have been changing; the number and nature of other kingdoms have also been understood differently by different scientists over the time.

Who proposed Binomial system of nomenclature? Give scientific name of mango. What is the binomial system of nomenclature? Who proposed this system? Give the scientific name of Mango.,"Binomial system of Nomenclature: (i) Naming of plants and animals with two words one generic and the other specific name is called binomial system of nomenclature. (ii) Carolus Linnaeus introduced this scientific system to name a species. (iii) He gave two names to a species: One is generic name while the other is specific name. (iv) This system of naming species by Linnaeus is called binomial system of nomenclature. (v) Example Homo sapiens is the scientific name of modern man. The generic name is Homo while the specific name is sapiens and name of the discoverer is Linnaeus. (Linn) or the name of the author to describer. Mostly generic names are Latin. (vi) Linnaeus explained this system in his work Systema Naturae (published in the year 1758). (vii) Carolus Linnaeus is called Father of Taxonomy or classification. Scientific name of Mango: Mangifera indica. Generic name is Mangifera, the specific name is indica.","providing scientific names better. The scientific name of mango is written as Mangifera indica. Let us see how it is a binomial name. In this name Mangifera represents the genus while indica, is a particular species, or a specific epithet. Other universal rules of nomenclature are as follows: 1.

What are the major divisions of classifications? Classify man. ,Major Division of Classification: (i) Kingdom: It is the highest category in the classification. There are two kingdoms: plantae and Animalia. (ii) Phylum: A group of closely related classes having certain common characters. (iii) Class: A group of closely related orders having certain common characters. (iv) Order: A group of closely related families having certain common characters. (v) Family: A group of closely related genera having certain common characters.  (vi) Genus: A group of closely related species having certain common characters. (vii) Species: Individuals having certain common character plus some characters of their own. Classification of Man: Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordate Class: Mammalia Order: Primates Family: Hominidae Genus: Homo Species: sapiens,"All animals belonging to various phyla are assigned to the highest category called Kingdom Animalia in the classification system of animals. The Kingdom Plantae, on the other hand, is distinct, and comprises all plants from various divisions. Henceforth, we will refer to these two groups as animal and plant kingdoms. The taxonomic categories from species to kingdom have been shown in ascending order starting with species in Figure 1.1. These are broad categories. However, taxonomists have also developed sub-categories in this hierarchy to facilitate more sound and scientific placement of various taxa. Look at the hierarchy in Figure 1.1. Can you recall the basis of arrangement? Say, for example, as we go higher from species to kingdom, the number of common characteristics goes on

What are museums? Name some animals and plants which are preserved in museum.,"Museums: Museums are ""collection of dead preserved plants and animals for study and reference‚Äù. (i) It helps in gathering the first hand information about the habitat, soil and organisms of the area. (ii) The museum preserves plants like algae, fungi, mosses, and ferns, parts of gymnosperms as they cannot be kept in the herbaria. (iii) Animals specimens are fixed in chemical solution. They are preserved for longer duration. The specimens are identified and labelled. They are stored and a catalogue is prepared for future reference. Its objective is to record information and preserve specimens for taxonomic studies. (iv) Animals like snakes, fishes, mollusca, insects and others are preserved in museums.","1.4 TAXONOMICAL AIDS Taxonomic studies of various species of plants, animals and other organisms are useful in agriculture, forestry, industry and in general in knowing our bio-resources and their diversity. These studies would require correct classification and identification of organisms. Identification of organisms requires intensive laboratory and field studies. The collection of actual specimens of plant and animal species is essential and is the prime source of taxonomic studies. These are also fundamental to studies and essential for training in systematics. It is used for classification of an organism, and the information gathered is also stored along with the specimens. In some cases the specimen is preserved for future studies. Biologists have established certain procedures and techniques to store and preserve the information as well as the specimens. Some of these are explained to help you understand the usage of these aids.

 Biological museums are generally set up in educational institutes such as schools and colleges. Museums have collections of preserved plant and animal specimens for study and reference. Specimens are preserved in the containers or jars in preservative solutions. Plant and animal specimens may also be preserved as dry specimens. Insects are preserved in insect boxes after collecting, killing and pinning. Larger animals like birds and mammals are usually stuffed and preserved. Museums often have collections of skeletons of animals too.

There is a requirement of digger for digging roots, scissors for cutting twigs, knife for woody twigs and a pole with a hook for collection. (ii) Drying and Pressing: After collection, the plants are dried up by keeping them between the folds of old newspapers. The plants, after drying, are pressed up by a set of two broad straps. (iii) Mounting: The dried specimens are pasted on the herbarium sheets of standard size (29 x 41 cm). The specimens are fixed on the sheets by applying glue or adhesive. The specimens are sprayed with fungicides like 0.1% solution of mercuric chloride and pesticides like DDT, naphthalene to check fungal growth and infestations. (iv) Labelling: Labelling should be done with mounting. It should bear the botanical name, family, locality, data of collection with the habit of the plant specimen and the collector's name. (v) Storage: The sheets are arranged according to classification. They are stored in disinfected metallic cupboards. The information about the collected specimens is compiled and published in the form of a book.  ","1.4.1 Herbarium Herbarium is a store house of collected plant specimens that are dried, pressed and preserved on sheets. Further, these sheets are arranged

Give the diagnostic characters of Algae.,"The diagnostic characters of Algae are: (i) Algae are usually aquatic, either marine or fresh water. (ii) Plant body is unicellular, colonial, filamentous, parenchymatous or pseudo ‚Äì parenchymatous. (iii) Algae, like other aquatic plants, are covered over by mucilage. Mucilage protects the algae from epiphytic growth and decaying effect of water. (iv) Vascular tissues are absent. (v) A mechanical tissue is absent. The algae are held upright in water due to buoyancy provided by the latter (vi) Nutrition is photosynthetic. (vii) Plants contain chlorophyll ùëé, carotenes and xanthophylls. Additional pigments occur in specific groups. (viii) Vegetative and asexual modes of reproduction are abundant. Asexual spores are of two types, mitospores and meiospores. (ix) Sexual reproduction involves isogamy, anisogamy and oogamy in different groups. (x) An embryo stage is absent.","3.1 ALGAE Algae are chlorophyll-bearing, simple, thalloid, autotrophic and largely aquatic (both fresh water and marine) organisms. They occur in a variety of other habitats: moist stones, soils and wood. Some of them also occur in association with fungi (lichen) and animals (e.g., on sloth bear). The form and size of algae is highly variable, ranging from colonial forms like Volvox and the filamentous forms like Ulothrix and Spirogyra (Figure 3.1). A few of the marine forms such as kelps, form massive plant bodies. The algae reproduce by vegetative, asexual and sexual methods. Vegetative reproduction is by fragmentation. Each fragment develops into a thallus. Asexual reproduction is by the production of different types of spores, the most common being the zoospores. They are flagellated (motile) and on germination gives rise to new plants. Sexual reproduction takes place through fusion of two gametes. These gametes can be flagellated and similar in size (as in Ulothrix) or non-flagellated (non-motile) but similar in size (as in Spirogyra). Such reproduction is called isogamous. Fusion of two gametes dissimilar in size, as in species of Eudorina is termed as anisogamous. Fusion between one large, nonmotile (static) female gamete and a smaller, motile male gamete is termed oogamous, e.g., Volvox, Fucus.

 "
Why mosses and ferns are considered as amphibians of plant kingdom?,"Mosses (bryophytes) and ferns (pteridophytes) are considered as amphibians of plant kingdonm, because of the following reasons: (i) The gametophyte of both bryophytes and pteridophytes lack cuticle covering, therefore they grow in moist habitat to prevent desiccation. (ii) In absence of vascular tissues, all parts of the gametophyte are able to absorb water directly from moist habitat. (iii) The flagellated sperms of both the groups require an external supply of water for swimming to reach archegonia for affecting fertilization.","Bryophytes are also called amphibians of the plant kingdom because these plants can live in soil but are dependent on water for sexual reproduction. They usually occur in damp, humid and shaded localities. They play an important role in plant succession on bare rocks/soil. The plant body of bryophytes is more differentiated than that of algae. It is thallus-like and prostrate or erect, and attached to the substratum by unicellular or multicellular rhizoids. They lack true roots, stem or leaves. They may possess root-like, leaf-like or stem-like structures. The main plant body of the bryophyte is haploid. It produces gametes, hence is called a gametophyte. The sex organs in bryophytes are multicellular. The male sex organ is called antheridium. They produce biflagellate antherozoids. The female sex organ called archegonium is flask-shaped and produces a single egg. The antherozoids are released into water where they come in contact with archegonium. An antherozoid fuses with the egg to produce the zygote. Zygotes do not undergo reduction division immediately. They produce a multicellular body called a sporophyte. The sporophyte is not free-living but attached to the photosynthetic gametophyte and derives nourishment from it. Some cells of the sporophyte undergo reduction division (meiosis) to produce haploid spores. These spores germinate to produce gametophyte. Bryophytes in general are of little economic importance but some mosses provide food for herbaceous mammals, birds and other animals. Species of Sphagnum, a moss, provide peat that have long been used as fuel, and as packing material for trans-shipment of living material because of their capacity to hold water. Mosses along with lichens are the first organisms to colonise rocks and hence, are of great ecological importance. They decompose rocks making the substrate suitable for the growth of higher plants. Since mosses form dense mats on the soil, they reduce the impact of falling rain and prevent soil erosion. The bryophytes are divided into liverworts and mosses.
 3.2.2 Mosses The predominant stage of the life cycle of a moss is the gametophyte which consists of two stages. The first stage is the protonema stage, which develops directly from a spore. It is a creeping, green, branched and frequently filamentous stage. The second stage is the leafy stage, which develops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud. They consist of upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. They are attached to the soil through multicellular and branched rhizoids. This stage bears the sex organs. Vegetative reproduction in mosses is by fragmentation and budding in the secondary protonema. In sexual reproduction, the sex organs antheridia and archegonia are produced at the apex of the leafy shoots. After fertilisation, the zygote develops into a sporophyte, consisting of a foot, seta and capsule. The sporophyte in mosses is more elaborate than that in liverworts. The capsule contains spores. Spores are formed after meiosis. The mosses have an elaborate mechanism of spore dispersal. Common examples of mosses are Funaria, Polytrichum and Sphagnum (Figure 3.2).
 3.3 PTERIDOPHYTES The Pteridophytes include horsetails and ferns. Pteridophytes are used for medicinal purposes and as soil-binders. They are also frequently grown as ornamentals. Evolutionarily, they are the first terrestrial plants to possess vascular tissues ‚Äì xylem and phloem. You shall study more about these tissues in Chapter 6. The pteridophytes are found in cool, damp, shady places though some may flourish well in sandy-soil conditions. You may recall that in bryophytes the dominant phase in the life cycle is the gametophytic plant body. However, in pteridophytes, the main plant body is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root, stem and leaves (Figure 3.3). These organs possess well-differentiated vascular tissues. The leaves in pteridophyta are small (microphylls) as in Selaginella or large (macrophylls) as in ferns. The sporophytes bear sporangia that are subtended by leaf-like appendages called sporophylls. In some cases sporophylls may form distinct compact structures called strobili or cones (Selaginella, Equisetum). The sporangia produce spores by meiosis in spore mother cells.

 3.1.1 Chlorophyceae The members of chlorophyceae are commonly called green algae. The plant body may be unicellular, colonial or filamentous. They are usually grass green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and b. The pigments are localised in definite chloroplasts. The chloroplasts may be discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon-shaped in different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids located in the chloroplasts. Pyrenoids contain protein besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made of an inner layer of cellulose and an outer layer of pectose. Vegetative reproduction usually takes place by fragmentation or by formation of different types of spores. Asexual reproduction is by flagellated zoospores produced in zoosporangia. The sexual reproduction shows considerable variation in the type and formation of sex cells and it may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Some commonly found green algae are: Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Ulothrix, Spirogyra and Chara (Figure 3.1a).
 3.1.2 Phaeophyceae The members of phaeophyceae or brown algae are found primarily in marine habitats. They show great variation in size and form. They range from simple branched, filamentous forms (Ectocarpus) to profusely branched forms as represented by kelps, which may reach a height of 100 metres. They possess chlorophyll a, c, carotenoids and xanthophylls. They vary in colour from olive green to various shades of brown depending upon the amount of the xanthophyll pigment, fucoxanthin present in

Write the characteristics of seedless vascular plante (Pheridophytes).,"The characteristics of seedless vascular plante (Pheridophytes) are: (i) Dominant phase or plant body is a sporophyte. (ii) Plant body is differentiated into true roots, stems and leaves. (iii) Vascular tissues are present. They are of two types; xylem and phloem. In xylem, true vessels are absent. In phloem, companion cells and sieve tube are absent. Instead, sieve cells are present. (iv) Meiospores are formed inside sporangia. Sporangia are associated with leaves called sporophylls. (v) Gametophyte is small or inconspicuous. It is usually independent. (vi) Sex organs are multicellular and jacketed. It is usually independent. Archegonia are partially embedded. Archegonial neck is 4-rowed. (vii) Sperms are flagellate: They require an external supply of water for swimming to reach archegonia. (viii) Embryo stage is present. (ix) Heteromorphic or heterologous alternation of generations is present in the life cycle.","3.3 PTERIDOPHYTES The Pteridophytes include horsetails and ferns. Pteridophytes are used for medicinal purposes and as soil-binders. They are also frequently grown as ornamentals. Evolutionarily, they are the first terrestrial plants to possess vascular tissues ‚Äì xylem and phloem. You shall study more about these tissues in Chapter 6. The pteridophytes are found in cool, damp, shady places though some may flourish well in sandy-soil conditions. You may recall that in bryophytes the dominant phase in the life cycle is the gametophytic plant body. However, in pteridophytes, the main plant body is a sporophyte which is differentiated into true root, stem and leaves (Figure 3.3). These organs possess well-differentiated vascular tissues. The leaves in pteridophyta are small (microphylls) as in Selaginella or large (macrophylls) as in ferns. The sporophytes bear sporangia that are subtended by leaf-like appendages called sporophylls. In some cases sporophylls may form distinct compact structures called strobili or cones (Selaginella, Equisetum). The sporangia produce spores by meiosis in spore mother cells. The spores germinate to give rise to inconspicuous, small but multicellular,

What are ferns? Describe their salient features.,"(i) Ferns are found in tropical regions and dry rocky places. (ii) The plant body is distinguished into (i) underground stem such as rhizome (ii) it bears roots (ii) it sends aerial shoots. Leaves of fern are of two types: simple leaves with a single vein and compound leaves with several leaflets. (iii) The sporophyte phase is dominant in ferns. (iv) On the underside of leaflets are borne sori. (v) Sorus is protected by indusium. The sori contains sporangia. (vi) Spores germinate into prothallus, the gametophyte.  (vi) The gametophyte bears antheridia and archegonia on underside. The archegonia are at notch but the antheridia lie towards the tip between rhizoids. The antheridia bear flagellated sperms. The eggs lie at the base of the archegonia. (vii) The process of fertilization occurs when water is available for the flagellated sperms, to swim to reach the egg and the zygote is formed. (ix) First leaves appear above prothallus. The roots develop below it.","3.2.2 Mosses The predominant stage of the life cycle of a moss is the gametophyte which consists of two stages. The first stage is the protonema stage, which develops directly from a spore. It is a creeping, green, branched and frequently filamentous stage. The second stage is the leafy stage, which develops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud. They consist of upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. They are attached to the soil through multicellular and branched rhizoids. This stage bears the sex organs. Vegetative reproduction in mosses is by fragmentation and budding in the secondary protonema. In sexual reproduction, the sex organs antheridia and archegonia are produced at the apex of the leafy shoots. After fertilisation, the zygote develops into a sporophyte, consisting of a foot, seta and capsule. The sporophyte in mosses is more elaborate than that in liverworts. The capsule contains spores. Spores are formed after meiosis. The mosses have an elaborate mechanism of spore dispersal. Common examples of mosses are Funaria, Polytrichum and Sphagnum (Figure 3.2).

Write the salient features of vascular plants?,"The salient features of Vascular plants are: (i) The plant body is differentiated into true stem, leaves and roots and show a distinct division of labour for leading photoautotrophic life on land Roots fix the plant and absorb water and minerals from the soil. (ii) They possess vascular or conductive tissues xylem and phloem. Xylem transport water and mineral, while phloem conduct organic food. (iii) The dominant phase or plant body is a sporophyte. Gametophyte is reduced, either lives independent life or dependent upon the sporophyte. (iv) Multiplication occurs by vegetative propagation and sexual reproduction. Meiosis occurs at the time of spore formation (sporic meiosis) inside sporangia borne on leaves called sporophylls. (v) An embryo stage is present in the life cycle.","SUMMARY Flowering plants exhibit enormous variation in shape, size, structure, mode of nutrition, life span, habit and habitat. They have well developed root and shoot systems. Root system is either tap root or fibrous. Generally, dicotyledonous plants have tap roots while monocotyledonous plants have fibrous roots. The roots in some plants get modified for storage of food, mechanical support and respiration. The shoot system is differentiated into stem, leaves, flowers and fruits. The morphological features of stems like the presence of nodes and internodes, multicellular hair and positively phototropic nature help to differentiate the stems from roots. Stems also get modified to perform diverse functions such as storage of food, vegetative propagation and protection under different conditions. Leaf is a lateral outgrowth of stem developed exogeneously at the node. These are green in colour to perform the function of photosynthesis. Leaves exhibit marked variations in their shape, size, margin, apex and extent of incisions of leaf blade (lamina). Like other parts of plants, the leaves also get modified into other structures such as tendrils, spines for climbing and protection respectively. The flower is a modified shoot, meant for sexual reproduction. The flowers are arranged in different types of inflorescences. They exhibit enormous variation in structure, symmetry, position of ovary in relation to other parts, arrangement of petals, sepals, ovules etc. After fertilisation, the ovary is modified into fruits and ovules into seeds. Seeds either may be monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous. They vary in shape, size and period of viability. The floral characteristics form the basis of classification and identification of flowering plants. This can be illustrated through semi-technical descriptions of families. Hence, a flowering plant is described in a definite sequence by using scientific terms. The floral features are represented in the summarised form as floral diagrams and floral formula.

"Explain briefly the alternation of generation in bryophytes. What do you understand by ""alternation of generation""? Explain it with the examples of moss.","Alternation of Generations: During the life cycle of any sexually reproducing plant, there is alternation of generations between gamete producing haploid gametophyte and spore producing diploid sporophyte (i)The life cycle of moss represents two distinct generations: gametophytic and the sporophytic. (ii) Moss plant is a gametophyte. (iii) Spore is the beginning of the gametophytic generation. It develops into protenema which gives rise to male and female gametophytes. (iv) Gametophyte (haploid) consists of green thallus having archegoniophores and antheridiophores which bear sex organs and the gametes are produced in them either in monoecious or dioecious plants. (v) Zygote is formed after the fertilization (syngamy) of male and female gametes with the help of water.  (vi) Repeated divisions of the zygote give rise to the embryo (2N) which soon develops into sporophyte. (vii) The sporophyte of moss gets differentiated into three parts-foot, seta and capsule. Inside the capsule single celled spores are produced. (viii) After the dehiscences, they begin to germinate and give rise to the protonema to start the cycle again.
